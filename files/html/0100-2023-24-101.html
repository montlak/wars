<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-97"><span class="space">2.</span> Necessity for PFR to MSPB</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Normally courts will not review administrative decisions until all administrative appeals procedures are pursued and completed. The theory is that all administrative review procedures should be followed to avoid unnecessary cases in the courts. The Board's regulation defines the administrative exhaustion process to only require litigation of issues through the level of the initial decision, the PFR being an optional appeal. Under 5 CFR 1201.113 (2022), an initial decision becomes a final decision of the Board 35 days after it is issued if no one files a PFR and if no action has been taken by the Board on its own initiative to reopen the case. The regulation states, at subpart (e), that "[a]dministrative remedies are exhausted when a decision becomes final in accordance with this section." The language about administrative remedies being exhausted is the Board's way of saying that there is no regulatory or statutory requirement of filing a PFR as a prerequisite to obtaining judicial review of a Board decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.120 (2022); 5 USC 7703.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulation does not foreclose discussion about administrative exhaustion. Several problems remain: some courts may not be aware of nor care much for the Board's self-imposed limitations on the doctrine of administrative exhaustion; there is the problem of what to do if a PFR is filed by an employee that raises some but not all issues pursued in court; and there is the question of what occurs if only the agency files a PFR and the employee later seeks to raise issues in court after the agency PFR is resolved against the employee. The evolving case law has not neatly resolved these issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bosley v. MSPB</span>, 162 F.3d 665, 668-69 (Fed. Cir. 1998), clarified the law and explained that unless issues or claims are abandoned, the appellant may raise before the Federal Circuit matters litigated before the AJ, even if those same matters are not developed in a PFR filed by the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party in an MSPB proceeding must raise an issue before the administrative judge if the issue is to be preserved for review in this court. Thus, if the party fails to raise an issue in the administrative proceeding or raises an issue for the first time in a petition for review by the full Board, this court will not consider the issue<span class="Italic">. See Thomas v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 794 F.2d 661, 666 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Synan v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Meglio v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 758 F.2d 1576, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government concedes that Mr. Bosley raised the issue of retaliatory threats and temporary assignments before the administrative judge. The government argues, however, that he forfeited his right to raise that issue before us when he failed to raise it in his petition for review before the full Board. Based on prior decisions of this court, we reject the government's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">James v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 755 F.2d 154 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court held that when an appellant has raised an issue before an administrative judge but not in a petition for review to the full Board, the issue is preserved for review by this court unless the appellant has knowingly abandoned or waived the issue. The court in the <span class="Italic">James</span> case distinguished an earlier decision, <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, the employee raised certain contentions before the administrative judge but did not pursue those contentions before the full Board when the agency petitioned for review of the administrative judge's decision. Rather, in response to the agency's petition for review, the employee stated that the presiding official had made "no erroneous interpretation of statute, regulation or prior case law with respect to the initial decision in this case." <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, 717 F.2d at 1395-96. Significantly, the <span class="Italic">James</span> court characterized <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> as a case in which the employee had knowingly abandoned or waived the claims in question<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">James</span>, 755 F.2d at 156. Because the employee in <span class="Italic">James</span> had not affirmatively waived or abandoned the issue in question, but had raised the issue before the administrative judge and then had simply failed to renew it in his petition for review to the full Board, the court held that James was not barred from arguing the issue on appeal to this court. The court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The issues or, as in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, the claims, to be heard in a particular case before this court will be determined on the basis of whether the circumstances of the particular case show that the petitioner or respondent knowingly abandoned or waived claims or issues raised below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">755 F.2d at 155. This court has continued to characterize the rule in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> as limited to cases in which the employee knowingly abandons or waives claims that were raised before the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Holland v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 31 F.3d 1118, 1122 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Connolly v. United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 766 F.2d 507, 510 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see also Hays v. Postmaster Gen. of the United States</span>, 868 F.2d 328, 330 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More recently, in <span class="Italic">Uske v. United States Postal Service</span>, 56 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the administrative judge ruled that the employee's removal was improper, but rejected his whistleblower claim. The agency petitioned for review by the full Board, and the employee did not cross-petition or otherwise renew his whistleblower claim before the Board. The Board ruled in the agency's favor, and this court affirmed. On appeal, this court refused to consider the whistleblower claim that the employee had raised before the administrative judge but not before the full Board. <span class="Italic">See Uske</span>, 56 F.3d at 1378. Although the <span class="Italic">Uske</span> court did not state that the employee had knowingly abandoned or waived his whistleblower claim, the court did not purport to overrule or modify the rule in the <span class="Italic">James</span> case, and we do not interpret <span class="Italic">Uske</span>'s brief treatment of the issue as having that effect. Even if we regarded <span class="Italic">Uske</span> as being in direct conflict with <span class="Italic">James</span>, we would be obliged to follow <span class="Italic">James</span> as the earlier of two conflicting panel decisions. <span class="Italic">See Newell Cos. v. Kenney Mfg. Co.</span>, 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("Where there is a direct conflict [between decisions of this court], the precedential decision is the first.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government has not pointed to any circumstances suggesting that Mr. Bosley's failure to renew his claims regarding the threats of dismissal or the assignments away from his home office constituted a knowing waiver or abandonment of those issues. Nor, on the facts of this case, are we able to discern any basis for concluding that Mr. Bosley has abandoned those claims. We therefore reject the government's argument that Mr. Bosley is procedurally barred from raising those claims before this court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Price v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20051720398f3d132211581">398 F.3d 1322</a>, 1326 n* (Fed. Cir. 2005), provided a footnote explanation of <span class="Italic">Bosley</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Price failed to cross-appeal this issue to the Board, this court's case law allows Ms. Price to argue all issues presented during the addendum proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Bosley v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 162 F.3d 665, 668 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (allowing a petitioner to argue all issues raised in the initial proceeding regardless of whether appealed to the Board). Although the Board did not address Ms. Price's arguments regarding the second <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor, this court treats the issue as if it had been affirmed without Board comment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">James v. FERC</span>, 755 F.2d 154, 156 (Fed. <span id="Page_5318"></span>Cir. 1985) (treating an unmodified decision of the presiding official as the final decision of the Board).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 527 Fed. Appx. 868, 871 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) ("Although Ms. Johnson did not seek full-Board review of the discontinuation issue, that issue is not necessarily waived. Rather, because the issue was raised before the administrative judge but not the full Board, it is preserved for review by this court unless Ms. Johnson knowingly waived or abandoned it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bosley v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 162 F.3d 665, 668-69 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The USPS concedes that there is no basis upon which we could find that Ms. Johnson knowingly waived or abandoned the discontinuation issue."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hahn v. EPA</span>, 360 Fed. Appx. 157, 159 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (if an issue is not raised with the AJ, and is only raised for the first time in a PFR, it will not be considered by the Federal Circuit).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Bosley</span>, it was not predictable (and it may still not be certain) to what extent the courts view an administrative PFR as a precondition to judicial review. In <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391, 1395-96 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the AJ reversed a removal, concluding that the agency had an obligation to file for disability retirement for the employee rather than firing him. The appellant also raised the argument, not addressed by the AJ, that the agency improperly prevented him from filing for optional retirement. The agency filed a PFR from the initial decision, but the employee did not. The Board reversed the initial decision and sustained the discharge, finding no duty of the agency to file for disability retirement. On appeal, the court reversed on the issue that the Board decided, remanding for reconsideration. The employee pressed the issue raised before the AJ concerning optional retirement, but the court refused to consider it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner did not appeal any aspect of the presiding official's decision. In fact, in response to the agency's petition for review of the presiding official's decision, petitioner's attorney said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he Presiding Official made no erroneous interpretation of statute, regulation, or prior case law with respect to the initial decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By choosing not to appeal from the presiding official's decision, petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claims based on the agency's refusal to process his request for an early optional retirement and the failure to promote him to GS-13. Allowing a party to withhold important issues from the board and later present them to this court would undermine the board's authority. <span class="Italic">Haynes v. United States</span>, 418 F.2d 1380 (Ct. Cl. 1969). Therefore, petitioner's early optional retirement and promotion claims will not be considered by this court for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court may have moderated its exhaustion doctrine in <span class="Italic">Meehan v. USPS</span>, 718 F.2d 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1983), involving an issue of jurisdiction over a discrimination defense. The court considered whether the appellant could have raised the issue on a petition for review to the court even if it had not been raised in a petition for review filed with the MSPB from an unfavorable initial decision. At footnote 6 of the opinion, the court remarked: "[I]n view of the limited grounds for obtaining review of a Presiding Official's initial decision by the Board (<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 1201.115), the issue of discrimination may be preserved even though not presented to the Board itself where only an evidentiary basis for challenging the finding of no discrimination exists." From this holding it was difficult to discern whether the court was suggesting that only legal issues need be preserved through a PFR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the court seemed satisfied that an issue was argued at all available administrative levels, but added an exception to the usual exhaustion rule at footnote 2: if an issue is one of due process that was briefed and argued by both parties, it is properly before the court and the court may decide it to prevent injustice that would otherwise result. In a subsequent case, <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> was cited for the holding that an issue may not first be raised in the appeals court when it could have been raised before the Board but was not. <span class="Italic">Synan v. MSPB</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. DLA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1997 NP No. 96-3094) (on appeal to court, an appellant may not raise an issue that was not raised before the MSPB). <span class="Italic">Synan</span> was cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Boley v. USPS</span>, 917 F.2d 19, 21 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In <span class="Italic">Uske v. USPS</span>, 56 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the court simply held on the authority of <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> that "Uske did not file an appeal of the AJ's denial of his whistle-blowing claim to the full board and we, therefore, will not now consider Uske's whistle-blowing argument."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">James v. FERC</span>, 747 F.2d 1581, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1985), provided some clarification. In the course of two decisions, the court shifted from an analysis of exhaustion of remedies to an analysis of waiver of claims. The employee was discharged for abusive language to his supervisor, an act of insubordination. The employee argued that there was no nexus between his conduct and removal and that there was inadequate consideration by the agency and the Board of mitigating circumstances. The government argued that the employee could only raise issues with the court that were addressed in a PFR with the Board. The court disagreed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e first consider the government's preliminary contention that petitioner can raise on appeal only those issues that were presented in his <span class="Italic">petition for review</span> to the full board, citing <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391, 1395-96 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Under <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, according to the government, "except for the claim that consideration was not given to the allegedly mitigating factor of profanity in the printing plant, there has been a failure to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to every point raised on appeal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7701(e)(1),...a party <span class="Italic">may</span> petition the full board to review the decision of a presiding official. By regulation, 5 CFR 1201.115, the board has limited the grounds for accepting review by the full board to two:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;New and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available when the record was closed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;The decision of the presiding official is based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a party chooses this route and the petition is denied, the presiding official's decision becomes the decision of the board and is appealable. If it is granted, the board's subsequent decision is appealable (together with the presiding official's decision to the extent endorsed by the board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, a petitioner may entirely bypass the step of seeking review by the full board. If a party chooses not to seek full board review (which he must do within a specified time), the presiding official's decision automatically becomes the final decision of the full board and is judicially reviewable in its entirety....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the government's view, a petitioner would forfeit the right to judicial review of certain issues that were before the presiding official by not stating them in his petition to the full board even though they do not fit into what the board clearly intends to be restrictive categories. Thus, a litigant would have to either ignore the board's regulation or take a direct judicial appeal to preserve all issues raised below. This is clearly not the import of <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lizut</span> involved a situation in which the full board <span class="Italic">granted</span> a petition for review (filed by the government)...and proceeded to undertake a comprehensive review of the presiding official's decision. In this review by the full board, the employee did not pursue certain issues argued to the presiding official, but sought to raise them on appeal to this court. Allowing a party to withhold important issues from the full board, <span class="Italic">once review has been accepted</span>, and later present them to this court would undermine the board's authority. Accordingly, the court in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> refused to consider those "reactivated" issues because of the petitioner's failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, here the board <span class="Italic">denied</span> the petition for review and petitioner, thus, had no opportunity to raise any pendent issues before the full board. <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> is clearly not applicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">James</span> was reexamined and reaffirmed on rehearing, <span class="Italic">James v. FERC</span>, 755 F.2d 154, 155-56 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e reaffirm that the petition for review does not limit the issues before this court. The issues or, as in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, the claims, to be heard in a particular case before this court will be determined on the basis of whether the circumstances of the particular case show that the petitioner or respondent knowingly abandoned or waived claims or issues raised below. A party will, of course, not generally be heard on any issues raised for the first time on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">James</span>, upon denial of the petition for review, the unmodified decision of the [administrative judge] became the final decision of the board and all issues raised before the presiding official were appealable. Nothing in the record reveals an affirmative abandonment or waiver of any issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, the administrative judge had dismissed two claims for lack of jurisdiction (one dealing with right to a promotion; the other dealing with the refusal of the agency to take steps to enable Lizut to secure early retirement). This court refused to address the dismissal of these claims and considered only the third claim (dealing with a removal action) with respect to which a petition for review had been filed by the government. <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, in response to the government's petition, <span class="Italic">expressly</span> endorsed the administrative judge's decision in all respects. A waiver was, thus, effected as to the other claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On rehearing, <span class="Italic">James</span> converted the preclusion issue to analysis of an affirmative waiver. Yet the Federal Circuit has not been consistent in the application of the exhaustion doctrines, and although the PFR process may be omitted under current regulations, if it is used by any party, then it appears best to raise all issues. The need for a margin of safety in interpretation of Federal Circuit law was made clear in a 1985 decision concluding that if counsel files a PFR, he must raise all the issues in the PFR that he intends to raise in court. Neither <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391, 1396 (Fed. Cir. 1983), nor <span class="Italic">James v. FERC</span>, 747 F.2d 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1985), states that a party petitioning for review by the full Board can forego raising in a PFR a particular question of the type that the Board reviews and nevertheless then present the omitted issue to the court. "The basic theory of the exhaustion of administrative remedies would be subverted by such a procedure." <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. <span id="Page_5319"></span>84-1430). But Judge Nies reemphasized in a dissenting opinion in 1988 that a PFR with the Board is wholly optional. <span class="Italic">Allred v. DHHS</span>, 786 F.2d 1128, 1133 (Fed. Cir. 1986). But <span class="Italic">Forest v. MSPB</span>, 47 F.3d 409, 411-12 (Fed. Cir. 1995), showed flexibility as to issues of statutory interpretation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Forest argues that the board had jurisdiction over his appeal under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). The AJ did not address this potential basis for jurisdiction in his decision, nor did Forest raise it in his petition for review, which the board denied. However, Forest did raise the issue in his initial appeal to the board and, since it is one of statutory interpretation involving no factfinding, we will consider this argument. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">James v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm'n</span>, 747 F.2d 1581, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (issue raised in initial appeal but not raised in denied petition for review may be considered on appeal to the Federal Circuit), <span class="Italic">reh'g denied</span>, 755 F.2d 154, 155 (1985) ("[W]e reaffirm that the petition for review does not limit the issues before this court."); <span class="Italic">Beard v. General Services Admin.</span>, 801 F.2d 1318, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (statutory issue not raised before the board may be raised on appeal when the issue does not require the development of a factual record, the application of agency expertise, or the exercise of administrative discretion); <span class="Italic">cf. Synan v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (arguments not made before the board cannot be raised on appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rules concerning exhaustion are imprecise. Part of the reason is that the Board's procedures concerning treatment of petitions for review and cross-petitions for review have not always been clear. There is good reason for flexible application of preclusion doctrines. Litigators recognize that issues develop at different stages of litigation and that the exhaustion doctrine is subject to exceptions, applied to meet necessity. Questions of law and those of general impact are often decided by appellant tribunals--as long as there is no need for new factual evidence--if they have not been raised below, even assuming there was good reason for raising the issue below. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Mathews</span>, 544 F.2d 1233, 1237 (5th Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Higginbotham v. Ford Motor Co.</span>, 540 F.2d 762, 768 n.10 (5th Cir. 1976) (rule against raising new issues on appeal is subject to exceptions, one being when a manifest injustice would result from ignoring the new legal theory); <span class="Italic">Krause v. Sacramento Inn</span>, 479 F.2d 988, 989 (9th Cir. 1973) ("Relaxation of this rule is sometimes appropriate in appeals wherein there are significant questions of general impact or when injustice might otherwise result."); <span class="Italic">Evans v. Triple R Welding &#x0026; Oil Field Maintenance Corp.</span>, 472 F.2d 713, 716 (5th Cir. 1973) ("Ordinarily as a reviewing court we do not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal except where, as here, a pure question of law is involved and a refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice."). Justice Black observed in <span class="Italic">Hormel v. Helvering</span>, 312 U.S. 552, 557 (1941):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the ends of justice, not to defeat them. A rigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which courts of review would invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all questions which had not previously been specifically urged would be out of harmony with this policy. Orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice.</p>
