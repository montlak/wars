<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-262"><span class="space">a.</span> Damages, Penalties, Expenses, Interest</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator has considerable discretion in fashioning a remedy, without an unwarranted personnel action he cannot award back pay under 5 USC 5596. It cannot be awarded as a punishment against an agency that lawfully discontinues an environmental differential but does so without consulting or negotiating with the union. <span class="Italic">Griffiss AFB and AFGE Local 2612</span>, 15 FLRA 213, 214 (1984). The Back Pay Act cannot be used to punish an agency's unfair treatment of an individual if there is no demonstration that the individual would have received the monetary benefit had there not been an improper personnel action. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 16 FLRA 552, 553 (1984). An award of $1,000 against an agency for an unnecessary continuation of a hearing was set aside. Punitive damages cannot be awarded against the government and the award could not be considered compensatory. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Cleveland and AFGE Local 31</span>, 19 FLRA 242, 243 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Defense Depot Memphis and AFGE Local 2501</span>, 43 FLRA 228, 236 (1991) ("Arbitrators are precluded from awarding punitive damages against the Federal Government."). An award of back pay to a union rather than to the employee was set aside since the Back Pay Act can only run to the benefit of the employee who was the victim of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Region and IBEW Local 1759</span>, 42 FLRA 902, 923 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">VA No. Cal. Health Care System and AFGE Local 1206</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-214.html">71 FLRA 1127</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (setting aside award, based on equity or estoppel, of reimbursement to union of travel-related expenses for canceled training; no contract article supported the award); <span class="Italic">EPA Chicago and AFGE Local 704</span>, 58 FLRA 495, 496 n.4 (2003) (dicta: award of $10,000 to union as result of agency's failure to interview candidates for vacant position was contrary to law; there was no authorization for award of monetary damages under those circumstances).</p>
<p class="noindent">That back pay cannot be awarded as a penalty was reiterated, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3627</span>, 63 FLRA 274, 278 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception contends that an arbitration award is contrary to law, the Authority reviews <span class="Italic">de novo </span>the question of law raised by the exception and the award. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU Chapter </span>24, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">E.g., NFFE Local </span>1437, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the following portion of the award demonstrates, the sole basis specified by the Arbitrator for the award of backpay was punitive:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I find that the Agency engaged in egregious stone-walling, destruction of important evidence, and delaying of this [c]ase to the extent that, <span class="Italic">as an added penalty</span>, it should reimburse any employees who are promoted to GS-9 Paralegal as a result of this Award for their lost pay (differential) from December 1, 2000 until the date of their promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority has uniformly and repeatedly recognized, an award of punitive damages against the federal government is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">E.g., Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 19 FLRA 242, 243 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Mo. Pacific R.R., Co. v.

<p class="noindent">Additional analysis of the authority of an arbitrator to make amends under the Back Pay Act in nondisciplinary cases is provided by <span class="Italic">NLRB, Office of Gen. Counsel and NLRB Union</span>, 36 FLRA 743, 745-47 (1990). The employer barred two employees from outside part-time work as civil service hearing officers for a local municipality because, the employer contended, there was a conflict of interest. Not so, the arbitrator ruled in awarding the amount the arbitrator <span id="page_2194"></span>concluded the employees would have earned had they been able to accept the outside employment. FLRA set aside the portion of the award providing compensation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]rbitrators have broad remedial authority.... Nevertheless, awards of compensation under the statute must comply with the requirements of the Back Pay Act or be authorized by some other clear expression of a waiver of sovereign immunity....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act applies when an employee has been affected by an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action which "resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1).... 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803, a Government-wide regulation, defines "[p]ay, allowances, and differentials" under the Back Pay Act as "monetary and employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation by virtue of the performance of a Federal function."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that as a result of the Agency's violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the grievants lost the income they would have received as hearing officers for the DCSC. Acting as hearing officers for the DSCS, however, does not constitute "performance of a federal function."... Further, even assuming that the grievants, as Federal employees covered by the parties' agreement, were entitled to approval for their requests for outside employment, the income that the grievants would have earned from that outside employment cannot be characterized as emoluments of their positions as Federal employees. Accordingly, we conclude that the grievants' pay, allowances or differentials were not affected by the Agency's unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Government is not subject to monetary liability unless it has waived its sovereign immunity.... Further, a "waiver of the traditional sovereign immunity cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed." [<span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. at 399]. As the Agency's violation of the parties' agreement did not result in a withdrawal or reduction of the grievants' pay, allowances or differentials, within the meaning of the Back Pay Act, the Back Pay Act does not provide a basis for the Arbitrator's award. We are aware of no other express authorizations for the Arbitrators' award of compensation to the grievants and none have been cited to us. Accordingly, we conclude that the award is deficient because it is contrary to law. We will, therefore, strike the portion of the award ordering compensation to the grievants.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was set aside that directed the agency to pay 1% of an employee's base salary as compensation for potential rather than actual loss of earnings in a performance appraisal dispute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 56 FLRA 541, 543 (2000). In <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FDC Honolulu and AFGE Local 1218</span>, 66 FLRA 858, 858-60 (2012) (Chairman Pope concurring), the grievance asserted that the agency took too long to act on disciplinary investigations, that two employees were placed at a disadvantage during the pendency of those investigations as to positions they sought or contemplated applying for, and that as a result, the employees should receive compensation for the higher pay of those positions. There was no determination of the qualifications of the employees for the positions or their relative ranking as to individuals who may have been selected for the jobs. The award of compensation constituted damages not authorized by the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated to the following issue: "Did the [Agency] violate investigative time processing and disciplinary or adverse action obligations as stated by the [parties' agreement], Article 30, Section (d). If so, what is an appropriate remedy?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found instances where months or sometimes years elapse before the Agency resolves disciplinary matters, "if they are resolved at all." The Arbitrator further found that the Agency's pattern of conduct in this respect was "arbitrary and unreasonable" and violated the parties' agreement. He therefore sustained the grievance. Noting that the parties' agreement requires that grievances be filed within forty calendar days of the date of the "alleged grievable occurrence," the Arbitrator concluded that only two grievants filed grievances within that time limit. The Arbitrator acknowledged, however, that he considered evidence beyond the forty-day time limit as a basis for remedying the Agency's overall delayed processing of disciplinary and/or adverse action matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator ordered remedies addressing both the harm experienced by the two grievants and the Agency's ongoing failure to timely investigate employee misconduct and take any resulting disciplinary and/or adverse action. Regarding the two grievants, he ordered the Agency to compensate them "for jobs for which they were not considered or which they either filed an application or in which they had expressed an interest" while their disciplinary investigations were pending....</p>

Thus, there is no right to money damages in a suit against the United States without a waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, 52 FLRA at 49.

FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273, 277 (D.C. Cir. 1995)). As such, an award by an arbitrator requiring that an agency provide monetary damages to a union or employee must be supported by statutory authority to impose such a remedy. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Minot Air Force Base, N.D.</span>, 61 FLRA 366, 370 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>) (then-Member Pope dissenting in part on another matter) (citation omitted). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, an arbitrator's monetary remedy is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, 52 FLRA at 49.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award is contrary to the doctrine of sovereign immunity because the Arbitrator provided no statutory authority supporting the award of damages.&#x2003;As the Agency contends, the Arbitrator did not cite any statutory basis for compensating the two grievants for alleged missed job opportunities due to the Agency's failure to timely investigate allegations of their misconduct and take any resulting disciplinary and/or adverse action. And the Union does not cite another statutory waiver of sovereign immunity to support the award. Accordingly, we find the award of damages contrary to law and set it aside. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Disability Adjudication &#x0026; Review, Region 1, </span>65 FLRA 334, 338 (2010).[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Given this conclusion, we find it unnecessary to resolve the Agency's claim that the award of damages is contrary to law because Authority precedent provides that employees are only entitled to the salary of the positions to which they are appointed.<span class="Italic"> See Soc. Sec. Admin., Branch Office, E. Liverpool, Ohio, </span>54 FLRA 142, 149 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">Setting aside an award of household-related expenses incurred by reason of delay in approval of a home transfer program application, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2913</span>, 67 FLRA 107, 110 (2013), found no authorization for the award in the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Act does not authorize the "actual expenses" awarded by the Arbitrator in connection with the home-sale program, because the "actual expenses" are not pay, allowances, or differentials under the Act. The Union disputes this and argues that the Act allows the award of "actual expenses."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Act, an award of backpay is authorized only when: (1) an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of pay, allowances, or differentials. If these requirements are met, then an employee, on correction of the personnel action, is entitled to receive "an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials...which the employee normally would have earned."[40] Accordingly, the Authority has found that a remedy under the Act must be pay, allowances, or differentials, as defined by OPM.[41] And applying OPM's definition of "[p]ay, allowances, and differentials,"[42] the Authority has held that a remedy under the Act must be "'pay, leave, [or] other monetary employment benefits'" to which the employee "is entitled by statute or regulation."[43] Where there is no statute or regulation permitting that remedy, the Authority has set the remedy aside.[44]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator did not cite a statute or regulation entitling the grievant to "actual expenses including mortgage, utilities, and lawn maintenance" under the Act. Instead, he cited <span class="Italic">Naekel</span>,[46] and stated that "[r]elocation costs...have been found to be within the definition of allowances in the [Act]." Similarly, the Union also argues that under <span class="Italic">Naekel</span>, relocation costs are "allowances" under the Act. However, <span class="Italic">Naekel</span> did not hold that relocation costs are "allowances" under the Act. Rather, <span class="Italic">Naekel</span> addressed what amount should be included in a wrongfully discharged employee's interim earnings, which are set off against an agency's backpay obligation. In addressing this issue, <span class="Italic">Naekel</span> merely held that the employee was entitled to deduct certain normally reimbursed relocation costs from his interim earnings. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Naekel</span> does not obviate the requirement that there be a <span id="page_2195"></span>federal law or regulation entitling the grievant to "actual expenses." The Union does not cite, and the record does not show, any federal law or regulation entitling the grievant to "actual expenses." Accordingly, the "actual expenses" that the grievant incurred for his former home's "mortgage, utilities, and lawn maintenance" are not "pay, leave, [or] other monetary employment benefits to which the grievant is entitled by statute or regulation."[52] Therefore, they are not pay, allowances, or differentials recoverable under the Act. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award of "actual expenses" is not authorized by the Act.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that "sovereign immunity" bars the award of "actual expenses." Other than the Act, the Union does not cite any statute to support its claim that the award of "actual expenses" is permissible. And the record does not disclose any waiver of sovereign immunity other than the Act. For these reasons, we conclude that sovereign immunity bars the Arbitrator's award of "actual expenses."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated previously, the Union contends that the Authority should not consider the Agency's claims that the home-sale program is discretionary and that the grievant is not entitled to its benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Educ. Fed. Student Aid and AFGE Local 3899</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-222.html">71 FLRA 1166</a>, 1169-70 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring), set aside a portion of a remedy that allowed costs incurred by a grievant whose telework arrangement was revoked:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the remedy ordering the Agency to reimburse the grievant for any expenses incurred as a result of the Agency's cancellation of her prior telework schedule is contrary to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Specifically, the Agency contends that there is no statutory waiver of sovereign immunity to support reimbursement for expenses in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States is immune from suit except as it consents to be sued.[40] Sovereign immunity can be waived by statute, but a waiver will be found only if "unequivocally expressed in statutory text."[41] Thus, an agency is subject to a monetary claim only if the statute on which the claim is based unambiguously establishes that: (1) the government has waived its sovereign immunity to permit suit, and (2) the scope of that waiver extends to an award of money damages.[42] Accordingly, the Authority has found that when an arbitrator directs an agency to pay monetary damages to an employee, there must be statutory support for such a remedy.[43]</p>

The fund was contrary to a statute governing disposition of public funds:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In &#x00B6; 3(E) of the award, the Arbitrator directed that "[a]ny amount owed to an employee who, after the best reasonable efforts of both parties, can not be located, shall be placed in an interest bearing joint account under control of the Agency and Union to be spent for the benefit of the bargaining unit in a manner mutually agreeable to the Agency and Union." The Agency contends that this portion of the award is contrary to 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(c)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(c)(1) provides in part that "[a] person having custody or possession of public money, including a disbursing official having public money not for current expenditure, shall deposit the money without delay in the Treasury or with a depositary designated by the Secretary of the Treasury under law." The award requires amounts owed employees who cannot be located to be placed in an interest bearing joint account under the control of the Agency and the Union to be spent for the benefit of the bargaining unit employees in a manner mutually agreeable to the Agency and Union. This part of &#x00B6; 3(E) is contrary to 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(c)(1) because this part of &#x00B6; 3(E) requires the Agency to set up an interest bearing joint account that would not be solely under the control of a Federal disbursing official and would not be returned to the U. S. Treasury.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the award would require the Agency to pay money due in a manner that is not authorized by law, the award is contrary to 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(c)(1) and this portion of it is set aside. <span class="Italic">See also INS, Los Angeles Dist., Los Angeles, Cal</span>., 52 FLRA 103, 104-05 (1996) (citations omitted) (under the doctrine of sovereign immunity remedy imposed must be supported by statutory authority).

Accordingly, we deny the Union's request.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Back Pay Act was amended in 1987 to provide for interest on back pay awards in general, with some exceptions. Section 623 of the Act, Pub. L. No. 100-202. The short version of the amendment provides, at 5 USC 5596(b):</p>

"As such, an award by an arbitrator that an agency provide monetary damages to a union or employee must be supported by statutory authority to impose such a remedy." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Minot Air Force Base, N.D.</span>, 61 FLRA 366, 370 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Minot</span>) (then-Member Pope dissenting in part as to another matter) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, FDA</span>, 60 FLRA 250, 252 (2004)). "In this regard, a collective bargaining agreement may require monetary payments to employees only where there is underlying statutory authority for the payment." <span class="Italic">Minot</span>, 61 FLRA at 370 (citation omitted). Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, an arbitrator's monetary remedy is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See DOT</span>, 52 FLRA at 49.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we examine whether the PMS or the BPA contains a valid waiver of sovereign immunity for awards of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award of interest rendered pursuant to the PMS is contrary to sovereign immunity.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress enacted the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-50, &#x00A7; 347, 109 Stat. 436, 460 (1995), codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122 (DOT Act). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, </span>65 FLRA 325, 327 (2010) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). Congress, through the DOT Act, instructed the Agency to develop its own "personnel management system [i.e., the PMS]...[to] address the unique demands on the [A]gency's workforce." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1). The DOT Act states that the PMS should "provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, training, compensation, and location of personnel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Additionally, the DOT Act states that Title 5 of the United States Code, with certain exceptions, "shall not apply" to the PMS. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2). "The BPA was not one of the exceptions specified." <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 65 FLRA at 327.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on the above framework, the Agency created its PMS. The Agency decided not to make the BPA part of the PMS. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Nevertheless, the Agency drafted the PMS to state that backpay from different sources could be awarded in certain situations. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 7 (quoting PMS, Ch. II, &#x00A7; 9). The PMS also states that interest on that backpay would not be permitted in several situations; backpay awarded for violations of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, however, was <span class="Italic">not </span>one of those situations. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Based on the foregoing, the Arbitrator concluded the grievant could receive interest under the PMS because he received backpay for a violation of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming without deciding that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the PMS was correct, nothing in the language of the DOT Act indicates that Congress waived the Agency's sovereign immunity to interest awarded as part of an award of backpay under the PMS. The DOT Act authorized the creation of the PMS. The DOT Act, however, contains no language that authorizes an employee to receive interest for an award of backpay awarded under the PMS. The only language in the DOT Act that could potentially provide for such an award under the PMS is the Act's statement that the PMS "should provide for greater flexibility in...<span class="Italic">compensation</span>[.]" 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1) (emphasis added). However, even assuming the term "compensation" encompasses backpay, this language contains no indication that it also allows <span class="Italic">interest </span>for that backpay. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>This provision, thus, does not unambiguously waive sovereign immunity as to interest for backpay awarded under the PMS. <span class="Italic">See DOT, </span>52 FLRA at 49 (stating that a waiver of sovereign immunity as to a particular remedy must be unambiguous). Additionally, as stated above, the BPA and its waiver of sovereign immunity as to awards of interest is not part of the PMS. <span class="Italic">See FAA, </span>65 FLRA at 327.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the PMS does not constitute a valid waiver of sovereign immunity as to awards of interest as part of an award of backpay. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award of interest under the PMS is deficient because it is contrary to the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award of interest rendered pursuant to the BPA is contrary to sovereign immunity.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's decision to award interest under the BPA is contrary to law because the BPA does not apply to the Agency. The Union asserts that the BPA applies to the Agency as a matter of law and contract. However, the Authority recently held that the BPA does not apply to the Agency as a matter of law or contract. <span class="Italic">See FAA, </span>65 FLRA at 327-28. Moreover, the Arbitrator did not award backpay under the BPA. Thus, as we explained in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, even if the BPA were applicable to the Agency, and the Agency's sovereign immunity to monetary damages under the BPA had been waived, the Arbitrator could not award interest under the BPA without first awarding backpay under the BPA. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 327. Based on the foregoing, we find that the award of interest under the BPA is also contrary to sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Concerning whether the Back Pay Act permits interest for back pay resulting from wrongful denial of discretionary (as opposed to mandatory) promotion, refer to <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Lujan</span>, 40 F.3d 1152, 1154 (10th Cir. 1994), concluding that interest is unavailable and following <span class="Italic">Brown v. Sec'y of Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214, 216-18 (D.C. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the Back Pay Act amendments, an arbitrator could not award interest on back pay under the Back Pay Act. The legislative history of the Reform Act demonstrated that there had been consideration and rejection of a provision that would have permitted awards of interest. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and FEMTC</span>, 7 FLRA 30, 32-33 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DODDS, Panama Region and Panama Canal Fed'n of Teachers Local 29</span>, 25 FLRA 629, 631-32 (1987) (without obligation of back pay, no support for award of interest).</p>
<p class="noindent">If interest is required, the period for its calculation is nondiscretionary. The interest should be paid beginning on the date of the unjustified and unwarranted action. It must continue "until a date selected by the Agency, which date must not be more than 30 days before the date the Agency pays the grievant the required amount of interest." <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 72 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS Austin Serv. Ctr.</span>, 58 FLRA 447, 447 (2003) (relying upon 5 CFR 550.806(a)(2)). An arbitrator's award may conditionally award interest in the event that it is later determined that there is a requirement to compensate employees through back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 65 FLRA 290, 297 (2010) (set aside by reason of collateral estoppel in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO v. FLRA</span>, 672 F.3d 1095 (D.C. Cir. 2012)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The calculus for interest under the Back Pay Act was described in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 67 FLRA 376, 377 (2014) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 67 FLRA 715 (2014)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Awards of backpay under the BPA are paid with interest calculated "at the rate or rates in effect under [&#x00A7;] 6621(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code [(Code)] of 1986,"[18] which is known as the "[o]verpayment rate."[19] Section 6621(a)(1) provides that the overpayment rate "shall be the sum of: (A) the [f]ederal short-term rate determined under subsection (b), plus (B) [three] percentage points."[20] Pursuant to &#x00A7; 6621(b), the Secretary of the Treasury determines the federal short-term rate for each calendar quarter in the first month of that quarter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6621(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6621(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 2013-16 provides that the "rates for interest determined under [&#x00A7;] 6621 of the Code for the calendar quarter beginning October 1, 2013, will be 3 percent."[21] Accordingly, the rate of interest available under the BPA for a backpay award issued on November 6, 2013 was 3%. We therefore find that the Arbitrator's award of interest at a rate of 9% was contrary to the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;Rev. Rul. 2013-16, 2013-2 C.B. 275.</p>
<p class="noindent">Application of the interest formula is only for brave souls skilled in mathematics. OPM made matters easier for the rest of us, providing a website calculator: <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/back-pay-calculator/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/back-pay-calculator/</a>. Accuracy of OPM software for complex back pay calculations was called into question in <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Army</span>, 90 MSPR 136, 143, &#x00B6; 14 (2001). Those interested in reviewing applicable Treasury rates of interest as far back as January 1982 should read <span class="Italic">Dancer v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 224 (1988), although readers are cautioned that the author has reviewed other charts that show interest rates different from the figures in <span class="Italic">Dancer</span>. To obtain accurate figures, litigants may be required to examine the short-term federal rates published on the first Monday of each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. <span class="Italic">See</span> 26 USC 6621; 26 USC 1274(d)(1)(C)(i). The arbitrator is obliged to utilize the rate set by &#x00A7; 6621(a)(1) or his award of interest will be considered deficient; the award will be modified to require the appropriate rate of interest. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and NFFE Local 341</span>, 55 FLRA 152, 157-58 (1999).
