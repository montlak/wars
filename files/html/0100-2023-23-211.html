<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-209"><span class="space">c.</span> Agreement to Reassign; Work Schedule Change; Light Duty Position; Duration of Agency's Commitment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board implies a condition of reasonableness of duration if a settlement calls for an employee's reassignment, <span class="Italic">Parkman v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 410, 412-13 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ultimate burden of proving that a settlement agreement has been breached rests on the party asserting such breach. <span class="Italic">Fredendall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 371 (1988). In interpreting the meaning of a settlement agreement, the Board looks first to the words of the agreement itself, which are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time they contracted. <span class="Italic">Romano v. US Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 319, 322-23 (1991). Where, as here, a settlement agreement is silent as to the time or duration of performance, the Board has consistently held that a reasonable time under the circumstances will be presumed. <span class="Italic">Woods v. US Postal Service</span>, 64 MSPR 156, 159 (1994); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. US Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 561, 564 (1992). However, in deciding whether the agency has complied with the terms of the agreement, the Board will look beyond simply the length of time of compliance and make an assessment of the overall attendant circumstances, including the motives of the agency in reassigning the employee following a settlement agreement and its efforts to minimize any harmful effects on him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 564-65; <span class="Italic">but see Bobula v. Department of Justice</span>, 970 F.2d 854, 862 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (agreement entered into between government employee which stated that government would transfer employee to slot in U.S. Attorney's Office in Cleveland, Ohio, created a duty to so transfer her but did not amount to a promise to keep her in Cleveland office forever).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency promptly and completely complied with the agreement, and continued to do so fully for two years until management, finding it necessary to increase the effectiveness of its operations within its authorized employee complement, had to fill 37 positions which had not been filled through the bidding process. The agency asserted that it went about filling those needed positions using the procedures set forth in Article 37 of the collective bargaining agreement, and that the appellant was among those reassigned because, by virtue of the settlement agreement, he had low seniority in the Clerk craft.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, argued that the agency selectively implemented Article 37 in that there was another employee that it might have reassigned instead of him, but failed to do so. The appellant further argued that the employee does not have an agreement assigning her specific days and hours off, as does he, and that her current work assignment is essentially the same as the appellant's was, prior to his reassignment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the appellant's assertions are true, they may constitute evidence of bad faith on the part of the agency. The appellant did not provide any evidence, however, in support of his assertions. Moreover, the agency has not been afforded an opportunity to respond to the appellant's assertions or to present evidence in opposition. Thus, remand is necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall take evidence on the issue of whether there was an employee other than the appellant that the agency could have reassigned to the vacant position, but did not, and whether, in failing to do so, the agency acted in bad faith....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, through settlement, an appellant is to be reassigned to another position, and on reassignment the employee refuses the position as unsuitable, the agency may prevail in a subsequent adverse action if the employee cannot demonstrate either that acceptance of the position would cause irreparable harm or that the employee has some "privilege" (undefined by the Board) to refuse the position, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 89 MSPR 484, 490-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the agency's second removal action for unauthorized absence is not precluded by the settlement and enforcement claim concerning the first removal action. The Board's precedent allows an agency to take a subsequent adverse action after the reversal, cancellation, or stay of a prior adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Special</span> <span class="Italic">Counsel v. Department of the Navy,</span> 85 MSPR 454 &#x00B6; 24 (2000) (a return to duty pursuant to a stay does not insulate an employee from charges based on future misconduct); <span class="Italic">Strope v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 MSPR 539, 542 (1997) (an agency can renew an adverse action based on charges brought in a previous proceeding where the previous action was overturned solely on procedural grounds); <span class="Italic">Noble v. Department of Justice,</span> 68 MSPR 524, 528 (1995) (an agency may institute a subsequent personnel action after the Board reverses a prior action as long as the second action is taken for legitimate reasons). Here, the second removal for unauthorized absence was unrelated to the appellant's first removal for discourteous conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present circumstances are also analogous to the facts in <span class="Italic">Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 401, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), where the Board upheld a removal for AWOL, that originated with the appellant's refusal to report to a position to which he had been improperly reassigned. In <span class="Italic">Cooke,</span> the agency reassigned the appellant as part of its 1992-93 nationwide restructuring, and shortly thereafter reassigned him a second time. The appellant did not report to either position. Shortly after the administrative judge reversed the reassignments, finding that the agency was required to have used RIF procedures, the agency removed the appellant for AWOL. On appeal, the Board noted that these kinds of cases illustrate the "apparent tension between appeals which involve an employee's refusal to accept a directed assignment, an employee's refusal to follow a direct order, and the impact of the reversal of an agency's action upon a subsequent action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405. After discussing the appropriate Board case law and burdens of proof, the Board sustained appellant's removal. It first found that the agency's nationwide restructuring constituted a legitimate reason for effecting the appellant's assignment, even though the action was reversed because the agency used invalid procedures to accomplish it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 406. It then found that the appellant was required to obey the directed assignment, despite his belief that it may have been improperly effected, because his refusal was not protected by privilege or a legitimate concern that obeying would cause him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 407-08.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Cooke</span> analysis to the present case leads us to conclude that the appellant was similarly required to report to either the GS-5 position or his former GS-9 position. The agency had a valid reason to order him to report to one of these positions, which constituted its best effort to comply with the settlement agreement. Further, the appellant's refusal to obey the order was not protected by privilege or a legitimate belief that reporting would cause him irreparable harm. We also note that the appellant lacked a valid reason for objecting to reporting to his former position. He did not establish that his former position was not "suitable," as that term is used in the settlement agreement, and the appellant's initial removal was based upon misconduct, and did not involve circumstances where intolerable working conditions or harassment in the workplace led to a resignation. <span class="Italic">See Vaughan</span>, 77 MSPR at 546; <span class="Italic">Hurwitz v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 436, 439-40 (1994). Moreover, if the appellant had succeeded in having the settlement agreement set aside, and then prevailed in his original appeal, the appropriate remedy would have been reinstatement in his former position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5086"></span>[Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-053.html#sec8-54">Refusal to Accept Reassignment</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Parkman, supra,</span> the Board concluded that a settlement agreement stipulating a 38-hour workweek was not violated, <span class="Italic">Cullinan v. USPS,</span> DE-0752-03-0500-C-1 (NP 5/27/2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Cullinan v. USPS</span>, 442 Fed. Appx. 560 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)), when the workweek was subsequently reduced to 12 hours following implementation of the agency's National Reassessment Program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for enforcement (PFE) of a March 2004 settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to reassign the appellant to a position working 38 hours per week in exchange for the appellant's agreement to withdraw her removal appeal. The appellant alleged that the agency violated the agreement when it reduced her work hours per week to 12 following implementation of the agency's National Reassessment Process (NRP).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued a compliance initial decision (CID) denying the appellant's PFE. The administrative judge found that the NRP was a legitimate management action that was not contemplated by the parties when they entered into the settlement agreement in 2004 and that the reduction of the appellant's hours as part of the NRP was an independent and legitimate management action which was not precluded by the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Parkman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 410 (1995), in which the Board set forth the analysis for determining whether an appellant has met her burden of showing that the agency failed to fulfill terms of a settlement agreement where, as here, the agreement is silent as to the time or duration of performance. The appellant argues that the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Parkman</span> is misplaced because that case did not involve the NRP and the Board in <span class="Italic">Parkman</span> did not find that the agency did not breach the agreement; rather, it remanded the appeal so that the agency could address the appellant's allegations of bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the CID and during the proceedings below, the administrative judge correctly noted that <span class="Italic">Parkman</span> summarized the law applicable in this case. The factual distinctions between this case and <span class="Italic">Parkman</span> do not render the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Parkman</span> inapplicable here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge failed to properly apply the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Parkman</span> because, in determining whether the agency violated the settlement agreement, he did not consider either the agency's motives or the agency's effort to minimize harm to her. In particular, the appellant claims that the administrative judge failed to consider various evidence which shows that the NRP was not the agency's true motive for reducing her work hours, including: the short amount of time (30 minutes) the agency gave her to accept its offer of a 12-hour work week; and her grievances and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint against agency management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find unavailing the appellant's argument that the administrative judge failed to analyze whether the agency's motives for reducing her work hours were proper. As noted above, in the CID, the administrative judge found that the agency reduced the appellant's hours as part of the NRP and that the NRP was a legitimate management action that was not contemplated by the parties when they entered into the settlement agreement in 2004. The evidence does not show that the NRP was not the agency's true motive for reducing the appellant's hours. In that regard, we note that the appellant indicates on review that she filed an EEO complaint based on the reduction in her work hours. Because the appellant's EEO activity occurred <span class="Italic">after</span> the agency reduced her hours, the agency's decision to reduce her hours could not have been based on that activity. In addition, the short time the agency gave the appellant to accept its offer of a modified limited duty assignment does not, by itself, demonstrate that the agency acted in bad faith in reducing the appellant's hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the agency's efforts to minimize the harm to the appellant caused by her reduction in hours, on review the appellant reiterates her argument from below that the agency breached the settlement agreement by reducing her hours because there was other work available that she could have performed. The administrative judge rejected this argument in the CID, noting that the Board held in <span class="Italic">Beatty v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6; 9 (2010), that as part of the NRP the agency has the managerial authority to determine what tasks are operationally necessary and to whom to assign those tasks. The appellant's argument on review that the agency improperly failed to provide her available work is essentially mere disagreement with the administrative judge's explained findings and, as such, provides no reason to disturb the CID. <span class="Italic">See Schnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 12 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges on review that the administrative judge's finding that the NRP was a nationwide program which was not contemplated in March 2004 when the underlying settlement was finalized is "not relevant to an analysis under <span class="Italic">Parkman</span>." We disagree. If the agency knew or had reason to know, at the time it entered into the settlement agreement with the appellant, that it would be implementing the NRP and the appellant's work hours might be significantly reduced as a result of that process, then, arguably, it acted in bad faith in making her reassignment to a position in which she performed 38 hours of work per week a mainstay of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Adams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 6, 11 (1996). Therefore, whether the agency contemplated the implementation of the NRP at the time it entered into the settlement agreement with the appellant is relevant to the issue of whether the agency breached the settlement agreement by acting in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adams v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 6, 10-11 (1996), added that the Board can consider the duration of a negotiated reassignment, e.g., a light duty position, from two perspectives: whether the duration of the assignment is reasonable and whether the agency entered into the settlement provision in bad faith, i.e., knowing the new position could not be sustained for a reasonable length of time:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Where a settlement agreement is silent as to the time or duration of performance, the Board has consistently held that a reasonable time under the circumstances will be presumed. <span class="Italic">Woods v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 MSPR 156, 159 (1994); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 561, 564 (1992). However, in deciding whether the agency has complied with the terms of the agreement, the Board will look beyond simply the length of time of compliance and make an assessment of the overall attendant circumstances, including the motives of the agency in reassigning the employee following a settlement agreement and its efforts to minimize any harmful effects on her<span class="Italic">. Parkman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 410, 413 (1995); <span class="Italic">but see</span> <span class="Italic">Bobula v. Department of Justice</span>, 970 F.2d 854, 862 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (agreement which stated that government would transfer employee to slot in U.S. Attorney's Office in Cleveland, Ohio, created a duty to so transfer her but did not amount to a promise to keep her in the Cleveland office forever).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agreement did not specifically indicate how long the appellant would be assigned to duties in the Consumer Affairs and Claims Office. As to duration, it provided only that the light-duty assignment would be reviewed at least once per year, or at any time management had reason to believe that the appellant was able to perform satisfactorily in another position, and that the assignment could be modified in accordance with the needs of the service and the appellant's medical condition. In the absence of a clear indication as to the time of performance, therefore, a reasonable time under the circumstances is presumed, <span class="Italic">Woods</span>, 64 MSPR at 159; <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 52 MSPR at 564, and we need assess the overall attendant circumstances, including the agency's motives in canceling the appellant's light-duty assignment following the agreement and its efforts to minimize any harmful effects upon her. <span class="Italic">Parkman</span>, 66 MSPR at 413.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Implicit in any contract is the requirement that the parties fulfill their respective obligations in good faith, and acting in bad faith may constitute breach. <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 323 (1995). "Bad faith" is not simply bad judgment, but rather implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity. <span class="Italic">Silva v.

If, for example, the agency knew or had reason to know, at the time it entered into the settlement agreement with the appellant, that there was not enough actual light-duty work in the Consumer Affairs and Claims Office to occupy her for a reasonable period of time, then, arguably, it acted in bad faith in making the light-duty assignment the mainstay of the agreement. Similarly, if the agency knew or had reason to know, at the time it entered into the settlement agreement with the appellant, that the Consumer Affairs and Claims Office would shortly be moving to new quarters where the appellant could not be accommodated, or if it failed to make good faith efforts to acquire or make space for the appellant in any new office space, then, arguably, it acted in bad faith in making the light-duty assignment the mainstay of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Parkman</span>, 66 MSPR at 413....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2001, Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez filed an individual right of action appeal with the Board, alleging that the VA took personnel actions against him based on the whistleblowing activities. That appeal was dismissed after Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez and the VA entered into a settlement agreement. The Agreement provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The [VA] and [Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez] mutually agree that [Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez] will be reassigned to the Ponce Outpatient Clinic (hereinafter ["Ponce clinic"]) effective not later than October 21, 2001. [Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez's] pay will not be reduced.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5087"></span>Since the settlement in 2001, Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez has worked at the Ponce clinic.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties adhered to the Agreement for 16 years. However, on July 28, 2017, Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez received a letter from Gabriel Miranda-Ramirez, the Chief of Urology Service. The letter informed him of a change in his duty effective August 20, 2017, and that he was physically required to be at the Ponce clinic from "7:30 <span class="small">A.M</span>. until 4:00 <span class="small">P.M</span>. from Monday through Friday" to provide services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez argues that the Agreement includes no time limit and allowed him to maintain a compressed work schedule as long as he worked at the Ponce clinic.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">What constitutes a reasonable time is determined based on the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second of Contracts)</span> &#x00A7; 204 ("When the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bobula v. U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 970 F.2d 854 (Fed.

Four years after her transfer, the government reassigned her to an office in Akron, Ohio. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the context of determining whether the employee's breach of contract claim was frivolous, we concluded that "the four years that [the employee had] been in Cleveland would satisfy [a] requirement" under the parties' settlement agreement <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 862. In other words, the four year period was a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other circuits have examined the surrounding circumstances of the contract, in particular, "the background against which it was executed," to determine a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">Eagle-Picher Co. v. Mid-Continent Lead &#x0026; Zinc Co</span>., 209 F.2d 917, 918 (10th Cir. 1954). For example, in <span class="Italic">Eagle-Picher</span>, the contract was silent as to the duration of a joint venture contract. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 918-20. The court held that the continued duration should be determined based on "the facts and circumstances existing at the time the contract was entered into," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 921, and "[i]f no date is fixed by the contract for its termination, the agreement remains in force until its purpose is accomplished or until such accomplishment has become impracticable," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 919. The agreement there was for development of mining property under leases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 918. The court concluded that the joint venture contract continued during the renewed period after the original leases expired, because those leases were commercially profitable, which was the reason why the joint venture was formed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 919, 921.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Barco Urban Renewal Corp. v. Housing Auth</span>., 674 F.2d 1001 (3rd Cir. 1982) involved a contract between a housing authority and an urban developer for development of properties owned by the authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1002-03. No provision stated the duration of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1004. The contract contemplated that the parties would agree to a development plan requiring the authority to convey all properties to the developer within five years. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If negotiations for the plan failed, however, the developer had a right to first refusal if the authority offered the properties to others. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Based on the purpose and background of the contract's formation, the court concluded that a reasonable time for the right to first refusal was five years--the deadline to convey all properties for development--because its purpose was expeditious development. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1007, 1009-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The background of the Agreement here supports the conclusion that 16 years was a reasonable duration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the circumstances in which the Agreement was executed do not suggest that an unlimited duration was necessary to satisfy the contractual purpose. Here, at the time of the agreement's execution, Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez claimed that he faced animosity and retaliation at the San Juan hospital for his whistleblowing activities. The purpose of relocating Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez's workplace to the Ponce clinic was to mitigate the hostile environment by allowing Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez to leave that environment and work at another location, i.e., the Ponce clinic. Because Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez lived in San Juan, the parties also agreed to a compressed work schedule to accommodate his commute to Ponce. Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez admitted during oral argument that the purpose of the Agreement was to have him "transferred to Ponce" because "he suffered reprisals" due to his whistleblowing activities and that the "compressed work schedule was agreed upon" because he continued to live in San Juan. Under those circumstances, this unusual arrangement specified in the Agreement was for the period that Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez reasonably would have confronted the alleged hostile environment at the San Juan hospital. <span class="Italic">See Eagle-Picher</span>, 209 F.2d at 919-21 (considering circumstances surrounding formation of the contract).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the compressed work schedule was a very unusual term in that Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez would be paid for time that he was not working during his three hour commute. A federal employee is generally not eligible to be compensated for his commuting time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.422 ("An employee who travels from home before the regular workday begins and returns home at the end of the workday is engaged in normal "home to work" travel; <span class="Italic">such travel is not hours of work</span>." (emphasis added)). It would thus seem unlikely that the parties intended that this unusual arrangement exist indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, a 16-year period is a reasonable time for the alleged hostilities against Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez to dissipate.[1] As the party claiming a breach, Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez had the burden of proof but did not offer evidence that the claimed animosity persisted after that 16-year time period. <span class="Italic">Tech. Assistance Int'l, Inc. v. United States</span>, 150 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("The party alleging a breach of contract bears the burden of proving the breach."). Given Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez's failure, the Board correctly determined that 16 years was a reasonable time and Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez did not satisfy his ultimate burden to prove a breach of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In fact, as recently as 2017, Dr. S&#x00E1;nchez performed duties at the San Juan hospital due to facility issues at the Ponce clinic, and he did not claim that he continued to face a hostile environment.</p>
