<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-109"><span class="space">e.</span> Incorrect Information From Employing Agency Concerning Annuity Election</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Blaha v. OPM</span>, 106 MSPR 265, 269 n.*, 2007 MSPB 174 (2007) (stay denied, <span class="Italic">Blaha v. OPM</span>, 106 MSPR 494, 2007 MSPB 218 (2007)), <span class="Italic">reconsid. denied,</span> <span class="Italic">Blaha v. OPM</span>, 108 MSPR 21, 2007 MSPB 263 (2007)), considered whether the time limit for electing an insurable interest survivor annuity could be waived because of incorrect information received from the employing agency concerning the availability of the annuity, defined as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An insurable interest annuity may be elected to provide a survivor benefit only for a person who has an insurable interest in the retiring employee; such an interest is presumed to exist with the current spouse, a blood or adopted relative closer than first cousins, a former spouse, a person to whom the employee is engaged to be married, and a person with whom the employee is living in a relationship which would constitute a common-law marriage in jurisdictions recognizing common-law marriages. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.613(e)(1). When an insurable interest is not presumed, the employee must submit affidavits from one or more persons with personal knowledge of the named beneficiary's insurable interest in the employee. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.613(e)(2). Such affidavits must set forth the relationship, if any, between the named beneficiary and the employee, the extent to which the named beneficiary is dependent on the employee, and the reasons why the named beneficiary might reasonably expect to derive financial benefit from the continued life of the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board sent <span class="Italic">Blaha</span> back to its AJ for analysis of the possible misrepresentation, with the explanation concerning the impact of material misrepresentation on waiver of the annuity election period, 106 MSPR at 269-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long held, however, that there are three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (i) The statute or regulation may provide for a waiver under specified circumstances; (ii) an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, at least where such estoppel would not result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of statute; and (iii) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline may warrant a waiver of the deadline if a statute or regulation requires that such notice be given. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wutke v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 523, 528 (1995); <span class="Italic">Speker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (1990),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir.) (Table) and <span class="Italic">modified, Fox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 602, 606 n.4 (1991). Thus, the Board has held that the principle set forth in <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> does not apply in situations when a claim of equitable estoppel is raised and there is no claim for payment of money from the U.S. Treasury. <span class="Italic">See Mueller v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 639, 641 (1998) (alleged misrepresentation causing an appellant to withdraw an appeal);<span class="Italic"> Holtermann v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 380, 384 (1993) (alleged misrepresentation affecting a decision not to make a deposit for post-1956 military service); <span class="Italic">Pinkston v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 347, 350 n.2 (1993) (same); <span class="Italic">Snow v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 364, 367-69 (1993) (alleged misinformation regarding electing a lump-sum payment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, this case is factually similar to <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 77, 78-79 (1996), in which the appellant elected a reduced annuity with a partial survivor annuity for her spouse, then requested, four months after receiving her first monthly annuity payment, to change her survivor annuity election in order to provide a lesser survivor annuity for her spouse. OPM denied the request as untimely filed, and the appellant asserted on appeal to the Board that she should be allowed to change her election because OPM provided her with misinformation that led her to believe that she could change her election during the 18-month period immediately following the effective date of her retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 79. The AJ reversed OPM's reconsideration decision, finding that a waiver of the 30-day regulatory revocation period was required because OPM failed to provide the appellant with adequate notice of her election rights and corresponding deadlines. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the full Board disagreed with the AJ's ultimate finding that a waiver of the time limit was warranted, the Board nevertheless found that the AJ correctly analyzed the case using the three potential bases for waiving a statutory or regulatory deadline, as set forth above and in cases such as <span class="Italic">Speker. Id.</span> at 80. The Board did not invoke <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> as a basis for denying the appellant relief.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 80-81. Thus, contrary to the AJ's finding in this case, and consistent with the cases cited above, we find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> because it does not involve a claim for money from the U.S. Treasury in contravention of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Addressing the bases for waiver set forth in <span class="Italic">Wutke</span> and <span class="Italic">Speker,</span> we agree <span id="Page_4237"></span>with the AJ that the applicable statute and regulation do not themselves provide for a waiver of the time limit for electing or changing an election of a retirement annuity. Thus, there is no justification for waiving the time limit on this basis. <span class="Italic">See Thomas,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. at 81 (the first basis for waiver did not apply because the applicable statute and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.621, 831.622 do not specifically provide for waiver). We further find that there is no requirement that OPM provide notice of election rights and corresponding deadlines with respect to making annuity elections or changes. <span class="Italic">See Belanger v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 1 F.3d 1223, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (the right to change an election within 30 days of receiving the initial payment is not a "right of election" within the notification requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339; the notification requirement is limited to those rights of election found in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j) and (k)(2), namely, the right to elect for a former spouse a survivor annuity in the event of post-retirement divorce, and to elect for a new spouse a survivor annuity in the event of a post-retirement marriage or remarriage); <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. at 80-81. In any event, OPM notified the appellant on the retirement application form that "[n]o change will be permitted after your annuity is granted except as explained in the instruction," and notified her through the application instructions that "[y]ou may name a new survivor or change your election if, not later than 30 days after the date of your first regular monthly payment, you file a new election in writing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the second waiver basis, however, the appellant has asserted that her former employing agency provided her with misinformation at the time of retirement that caused her not to make a timely election of a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity for her domestic partner. Because the parties were not informed of the correct standard under <span class="Italic">Speker</span> in this case, and not afforded an opportunity to address the issue of whether affirmative misconduct would preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, we find it appropriate to remand this case for adjudication of that issue. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Smart v. Department of the Army,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 475, &#x00B6; 12 (2007) (remanding where the AJ did not apprise the appellant of the burden and elements of proof on his discrimination and retaliation claims). We further note that the appellant must show on remand that she acted reasonably in relying on the information provided by the Postal Service retirement counselor. <span class="Italic">See Wutke,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 529-30 <span class="Italic">(citing Heckler v. Community Health Services,</span> 467 U.S. 51, 59 (1984)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scriffiny v. OPM</span>, 108 MSPR 378, 379-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 6-16, 2008 MSPB 66 (2008), suggested that only intentional, or knowing, misconduct--not negligence--as to representations by a government official concerning possible changes in a survivor annuity could warrant the otherwise untimely modification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The essential facts of this case are not in dispute. The appellant was employed by the United States Postal Service (USPS) until her retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) on December 31, 2004. At the time of her retirement, she made a written annuity election, electing a partial survivor annuity for her spouse of 46 years, James Scriffiny. She made the election by checking box 1(b) in Section D of the Application for Immediate Retirement, Standard Form (SF) 2801 She attached to her written election an SF-2801-2, Spouse's Consent to Survivor Election, which was signed by her spouse. The appellant's retirement claim was finally adjudicated on February 17, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 4, 2007, the appellant made a written request to OPM to change her previous election from a partial survivor annuity to a maximum survivor annuity for her spouse, which OPM denied as untimely on January 11, 2007. On January 28, 2007, the appellant requested reconsideration on the basis that she had made her election based on misinformation given to her by the USPS at the time of her retirement. On March 26, 2007, OPM affirmed its initial decision denying the appellant's request to change her election of a survivor annuity based on her failure to make her request within 18 months of her retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) the statute or regulation may provide for a waiver under specified circumstances; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, at least where such estoppel would not result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of statute; and (3) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline may warrant a waiver of the deadline if a statute or regulation requires that such notice be given. <span class="Italic">See Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 8 (2007) <span class="Italic">(citing Wutke v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 523, 528 (1995)); <span class="Italic">Speker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table) <span class="Italic">and modified by, Fox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 602, 606 n.4 (1991). As the AJ correctly noted in the ID, the applicable statute and regulation in this case do not provide for a waiver of the deadline for electing a surviving spouse annuity, and OPM is not required by statute or regulation to provide notice of the deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(o)(1)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622(b)(1). Therefore, neither the first nor the third basis for waiver of the deadline applies in the present case. Accordingly, the only possible basis for waiver of the deadline here is affirmative misconduct that precludes enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM primarily argues on PFR that the doctrine of equitable estoppel can never justify waiver of the time limit for making a survivor annuity election because estoppel in such cases would lead to the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of statute. However, we need not reach that issue. Instead, we find that the particular facts of this case do not meet the legal standard for equitable estoppel against the government. <span class="Italic">Cf. Blaha,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 11 (denying OPM's request to reconsider whether the government can be estopped from denying a belated election of an insurable interest survivor annuity because that question might be rendered moot if the elements of equitable estoppel are not established).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that, at the time of her retirement, she wanted to provide for the maximum possible benefits and continuing health insurance for her husband, who is disabled. She therefore asked a USPS human resources employee how to complete the election form to ensure that her husband would have health insurance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> According to the appellant, the employee instructed her to select a partial survivor annuity rather than a maximum survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Joyce Lauritzen, the USPS human resources employee identified by the appellant as having given her the erroneous advice, also testified at the hearing. Although she acknowledged that she may have spoken with the appellant about her annuity election, Lauritzen had no specific recollection of any such conversation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found the appellant's testimony to be credible. She noted that there was no evidence disputing the appellant's version of events. She therefore found that the appellant's survivor annuity election was the result of misinformation provided by her employing agency. The AJ also found that the USPS' provision of misinformation to the appellant constituted affirmative misconduct. She further found the appellant's reliance on that misinformation was reasonable. The AJ therefore found that waiver of the filing deadline was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not explain the basis for her finding that the USPS committed affirmative misconduct by providing misinformation to the appellant. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has consistently stated that affirmative misconduct is a possible basis for waiving a deadline prescribed by statute or regulation, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Blaha,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 8, the Board has never actually waived a deadline on that basis. Therefore, the Board has no settled test for affirmative misconduct. Likewise, neither the Supreme Court nor the U.S. courts of appeals has established a clear test for whether the government has engaged in affirmative misconduct that would justify the application of equitable estoppel. <span class="Italic">See Ramirez-Carlo v. United States,</span> 496 F.3d 41, 49 (1st Cir. 2007). However, certain principles have emerged from the various court decisions applying the affirmative misconduct standard. Of particular relevance here, the courts agree that the negligent provision of misinformation does not constitute affirmative misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Socop-Gonzalez v. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service,</span> 208 F.3d 838, 843 (9th Cir. 2000) (neither the failure to inform an individual of his or her legal rights, nor the negligent provision of misinformation, constitutes affirmative misconduct); <span class="Italic">Estate of James v. U.S. Department of Agriculture,</span> 404 F.3d 989, 995 (6th Cir. 2005) (misrepresentations that were "either inadvertent or, at worst, negligent," do not constitute affirmative misconduct); <span class="Italic">Bensman v. U.S. Forest Service,</span> 408 F.3d 945, 965 (7th Cir. 2005) (finding no affirmative misconduct where "at worst, the Service negligently miscalculated the correct appeal dates"); <span class="Italic">Ramirez-Carlo,</span> 496 F.3d at 49 (affirmative misconduct "requires more than simple negligence"). We hereby adopt the same rule, and we find that it is sufficient to resolve this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not alleged, and the evidence does not show, that Lauritzen knew that the advice she gave the appellant concerning her survivor annuity election was incorrect. We therefore find that Lauritzen's actions were negligent, but do not constitute affirmative misconduct. Accordingly, we find that OPM cannot be equitably estopped from denying the appellant's request to amend her survivor annuity election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the appellant acted reasonably in reliance on information she received from her employing agency. We also recognize that, but for the misinformation provided by the government in this case, the appellant would have validly elected a maximum survivor annuity for her disabled husband. Nevertheless, because the USPS' conduct falls short of affirmative misconduct, we cannot equitably estop OPM from enforcing the 18-month deadline for amending her survivor annuity election. <span class="Italic">See Koyen v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 973 F.2d 919, 921-22 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (declining to award a survivor annuity because the employee failed to make that election at the time of retirement, despite the fact that his failure to do so was the result of erroneous advice from <span id="Page_4238"></span>OPM); <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Hansen,</span> 450 U.S. 785, 790 (1981) (declining to estop the Social Security Administration (SSA) from denying retroactive benefits based on the petitioner's failure to file a written application, despite the fact that an SSA representative had erroneously informed her that she was ineligible for benefits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we affirm OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Federal Circuit determined in <span class="Italic">Frantz v. OPM</span>, 778 F.2d 783, 786-87 (Fed. Cir. 1985), that an election time limit should be waived and that the annuitant should have be permitted to alter a decision not to provide a spousal annuity when information from her agency relating to her initial election--that if her husband predeceased her, the lifetime annuity would continue to be reduced--was incorrect and not adequately corrected through material later received from OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Waiver was unavailable in <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 751, 752-55 (1984), under the statute then applicable, requiring election of a survivor annuity by an unmarried annuitant within a year of marriage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chong Brown (appellant) filed a timely petition for appeal from a reconsideration decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) denying her application for a survivor annuity. OPM, citing the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2), determined that appellant was not entitled to the annuity, for her deceased husband did not elect a reduced retirement annuity with survivor benefits for his spouse in a signed writing received by OPM within 1 year after his marriage to appellant on April 15, 1977. OPM further noted that this requirement could not be waived even if appellant's husband misunderstood the requirement or received improper advice from his employing agency as to the necessity of making an election of a reduced annuity with survivor benefits within one year of marriage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision dated November 10, 1983, a presiding official of the Board's Denver Regional Office upheld OPM's denial of the survivor annuity. The presiding official found that appellant failed to establish that her late husband was provided erroneous information concerning the election of a reduced annuity with survivor benefits. Furthermore, the presiding official held he could not waive the statutory requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2) even if appellant's husband was misinformed as to its requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has filed a petition for review, alleging that the presiding official committed error in his consideration of the evidence, made erroneous findings of fact, and made an erroneous interpretation of his authority to waive the one year limitation contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant claims that both Board and judicial precedents support her argument that the one year time limit contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2) can be waived. In support of her argument, appellant cites <span class="Italic">Kauffman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 4 MSPB 325 (1980), <span class="Italic">Davies v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 5 MSPB 251 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Broad Avenue Laundry and Tailoring v. United States,</span> 681 F.2d 746 (Ct. Cl. 1982). These cases, however, are different from the case at hand. In <span class="Italic">Kauffman, supra</span> at 326, the one year filing requirement found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2) was in fact met and no waiver was necessary. In the instant case, a waiver is requested, for the filing deadline clearly was not met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Davies,</span> the Board determined that an appellant who had never received notice of an annuitant's right of election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j) and 8339(k)(2), and who was already receiving a reduced annuity with provision for survivor benefits for his spouse, should be allowed to continue receiving a reduced annuity. In the instant case, appellant at the time of his retirement received notice of his right to choose a reduced annuity with survivor benefits within one year of marriage. Furthermore, appellant's husband had chosen to receive a full, unreduced annuity at the time of his retirement. The factual setting varies from that existing in <span class="Italic">Davies, supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Broad Avenue Laundry,</span> the court held that a government contracting officer's modification of wage rates in a contract served to estop the government from denying payment at the adjusted wage rate, despite the fact that modification was in fact a violation of a Department of Labor regulation. The court specifically noted that the wage modification, although improper and reflecting a mistake of law, was within the contracting officer's authority, which was not subject to any express authority limitation. 681 F.2d 746, at 749. The appellant has not shown that the personnel officer who allegedly provided improper advice to her husband was acting within her authority to bind the government. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Broad Avenue Laundry</span> is not applicable as a precedent supporting appellant's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In numerous cases, courts have held that the government can not be bound by misinformation provided through its employees concerning eligibility for entitlement programs. In <span class="Italic">Montilla v. United States,</span> 457 F.2d 978 (Ct. Cl. 1972), the Court of Claims held that the misrepresentation of officers of the U.S. Army to the plaintiff, leading him to believe that he had completed twenty years of active military service and was thus eligible for retirement pay upon reaching age sixty, could not alter the fact that plaintiff had not actually completed twenty years of active service as computed under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1332 (1964). The <span class="Italic">Montilla</span> court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Unless a law has been repealed or declared unconstitutional by the courts, it is part of the supreme law of the land and no officer or agency can by his actions or conduct waive its provisions or nullify its enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">457 F.2d at 987.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Broad Avenue Laundry, supra,</span> which was cited by appellant in support of her petition, the court noted "The effort to use an official's errors to avoid compliance with an affirmative prerequisite to an entitlement, is a sure loser." 681 F.2d at 748. In <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Hanson,</span> 450 U.S. 785, 101 S. Ct. 1468 (1981), <span class="Italic">reh'g denied,</span> 451 U.S. 1032, 101 S. Ct. 3023 (1981), the court held that where a claimant for certain Social Security benefits inquired to the Social Security Administration as to eligibility, and was erroneously informed that she was ineligible when she in fact was eligible, the eligible claimant could not receive retroactive benefits on the basis of the misinformation. Citing <span class="Italic">Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill,</span> 332 U.S. 380, 68 S. Ct. 1 (1947), the Supreme Court noted all courts have a duty to "observe the conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury." 450 U.S. at 788, 101 S. Ct. at 1471.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, appellant contests the presiding official's factual determination that appellant failed to show that her late husband was misinformed by the agency concerning the necessity of selecting a reduced annuity with survivor benefits within one year of his marriage to appellant. Appellant further contends that she was unfairly denied the opportunity to present evidence, through the use of affidavits, to establish that her husband received improper advice from a personnel officer. However, appellant fails to establish, even assuming her husband was misinformed, that the giving of misinformation by the personnel officer should result in the waiver of the time limitations contained in 5 U.S. C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2). The personnel officer did not have the authority to waive the requirement that appellant's husband make a written request for a reduced annuity with survivor benefits within one year of the date of his marriage to appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf. Damsky v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 20 MSPR 129 at 132 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The affidavits which appellant sought to have considered, but which were rejected by the presiding official, provide evidence on the question of whether or not appellant's husband was in fact misinformed by the personnel officer and also appellant's husband's intentions to provide for appellant after his death. The information in the affidavits does not establish that the personnel officer had the authority to waive the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2), nor any other basis to disregard the requirements of that statutory section. Therefore, consideration of the affidavits would not have an effect on the outcome of this case, and any error by the presiding official was not harmful. <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy,</span> 6 MSPB 114, 115 (1981).</p>
