<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-208"><span class="space">11.</span> Waiver of Fee Through Settlement Agreement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement agreements, discussed in the next chapter, should be parsed with some care to avoid waivers of fee entitlements; alternatively, it is recommended that settlements of appeals fully state a right to and the limits of fee entitlement. As to waivers of fees, the Board explained how settlements would be construed in <span class="Italic">Paderick v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 456, 458-61 (1992) (overruling <span class="Italic">Rhoades v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 639 (1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Where a transaction has taken place out of which claims may or may not arise or be asserted in the future, a properly worded release will prevent the enforcement of such claims." 5A Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> 1238 at 559 (3d reprint 1986). "There is no particular form of words that is required in order to make a written release effective. All that is necessary is that the words should manifest a present intention to discharge," which is "to be determined by the process of interpretation."...<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 560. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Employers National Insurance Co.</span>, 928 F.2d 1438, 1441, 1447-48 (5th Cir. 1991) (language in a settlement agreement that "(all [sic] parties...waive any claims" against another party "with respect to the lien" intended a waiver of a claim for attorney fees with respect to that lien); <span class="Italic">Muckleshoot Tribe v. Puget Sound Power &#x0026; Light Co.</span>, 875 F.2d 695, 698 (9th Cir. 1989), citing <span class="Italic">Wakefield v. Mathews</span>, 852 F.2d 482, 484 (9th Cir. 1988) ("[i]f the [settlement agreement] contains an explicit reference to fees or the breadth of the release is so 'sweeping' that it necessarily includes attorneys' fees, a waiver may be found"); <span class="Italic">Wakefield</span>, 852 F.2d at 483 ("an express release [in a settlement agreement] not only of all claims and elements of damages, but of any 'costs or expenses of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, fixed or contingent'" barred an award of attorney fees); <span class="Italic">Aaron Ferer &#x0026; Sons Ltd. v. Chase Manhattan Bank</span>, 731 F.2d 112, 124-25 (2d Cir. 1984) (a release from "causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money...claims and demands whatsoever, in <span id="Page_4735"></span>law, in admiralty, or in equity...by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world to the day of the date of these presents, arising out of any transactions or occurrences involving" the opposing parties was sufficiently "broad and unambiguous" to bar the appellants' claims arising "out of transactions or occurrences" involving the appellees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in civil rights cases, the courts have considered the language of settlement agreements, as well as the parties' intent, in determining whether the appellants concerned waived their right to an award of attorney fees to which they would otherwise be entitled under 42 USC 1988. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Erdman v. Cochise County, Arizona</span>, 926 F.2d 877, 878-81 (9th Cir. 1991) (an offer of judgment in a civil rights action for a specific sum "with costs now accrued" did not clearly exclude an additional sum as reasonable attorney fees under 42 USC 1988); <span class="Italic">Jeff D. v. Andrus</span>, 899 F.2d 753, 765 (9th Cir. 1989) (issue involved in a compliance proceeding was "separate from the settlement of the underlying litigation and the waiver of attorney [&#8197;] fees in the settlement" did not bar the appellants from receiving, under 42 USC 1988, an award of attorney fees for the compliance proceeding); <span class="Italic">Brown v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 722 F.2d 1009, 1010-11 (2d Cir. 1983) (a settlement agreement utilizing language in a release that a case would be dismissed "without costs to any party" was intended to settle all claims involved in the particular litigation, including a claim for attorney fees under 42 USC 1988).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In light of the above authorities, we hereby overrule <span class="Italic">Rhoades v. United States Postal Service</span>, 36 MSPR 639, 644 (1988) [discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>], in its holding that "the question of attorney fees cannot be counted among the disputed issues settled by [an] agreement [before the Board], [if the attorney fees question] was not one of the issues initially involved in" the appeal before the Board. Thus, the Board will henceforth interpret a settlement agreement which provides that it is a "full and final settlement of all matters" in the appeal as constituting a waiver of the right to move for payment of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the pertinent provisions of the settlement agreement state as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;The $4,184.00 payment to appellant shall be made payable to "Allen P. Fancher and Neil Bonney, Attorneys for Lydia A. Hundley and the Estate of Ethel South Hundley," such sum to be in full settlement of and release by intervenor, and Neil C. Bonney of any and all claims of any kind against Appellant and/or the United States Government for survivor annuity payment and/or benefits and for expenses and attorney fees relating to the above referenced appeal and the government service of Dale W. Hundley....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;Intervenor agrees to withdraw and forever waive any future claim to the survivor annuity of Dale Hundley from May 31, 1987 forward.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we find that these provisions do not contain language that indicates the intervenor and OPM intended to waive attorney fees for a compliance proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the provisions concerned state that the intervenor's waiver of her right to attorney fees relates only to her claim for survivor annuity payments and benefits in "the above referenced appeal"--i.e., the initial appeal, MSPB Docket No. PH08318810435, that was referenced at the top of the settlement agreement--and not to all claims that are related to the underlying appeal. The petition for enforcement concerns OPM's failure to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement, while the underlying appeal involved the appellant's and the intervenor's rights to a survivor annuity under applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. Thus, the settlement agreement does not bar the intervenor from seeking an award of attorney fees for the compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jeff D.</span>, 899 F.2d at 765.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, a release of a contractual right "is the discharge of a present right, not of one to accrue in the future. Such a discharge makes a subsequent breach of duty by the obligor impossible. The release, therefore, is not a discharge of a future right to compensation for breach." 5A <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> 1238 at 559. We therefore find that, in the instant case, the parties' settlement agreement does not express an intent to waive the intervenor's right to request an attorney fee award for the subsequent compliance proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, we find nothing from the circumstances underlying the settlement agreement to reasonably infer that the intervenor intended to waive her right to request an award of attorney fees for the subsequent compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Jeff D.</span>, 899 F.2d at 765; <span class="Italic">W.J. Perryman &#x0026; Co. v. Penn Mutual Fire Insurance Co.</span>, 324 F.2d 791, 793 (5th Cir. 1963). Thus, the fact that the intervenor agreed to waive her right to an award of attorney fees with respect to the underlying appeal does not, in itself, establish that she also intended to waive her right to an award of attorney fees in connection with the compliance proceeding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement agreements may provide that reasonable fees will be paid if enforcement proceedings are required. The Board will enforce those agreements. <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 23, 25 (1989). To the extent that a waiver of fees in a settlement is to be effective, it may be that the settlement must be filed and accepted by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Franks v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 13 MSPR 606, 609 (1982), although it considered the agreement that provided the alleged waiver of the right to seek fees, the Board stated that "[s]ince the settlement was not a part of the record before the initial decision became final, the Board will not consider its impact, if any, on the merits of this case."<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bohan v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 601, 603 (1986) (Board held valid a filed settlement calling for the appellant's reinstatement and a waiver of claims for fees and back pay; the agreement appeared to be "freely made, fair, and the subject of mutual consideration"). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-22-212.html#sec15-210">Settlement of Fee Claim</a>" and to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-026.html#sec16-27">Waiver of Statutory Right; Release</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-23-015.html#sec16-16_1">Settlement After Initial Decision</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rhoades v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 639, 641-45 (1988), <span class="Italic">overruled</span> <span class="Italic">by</span> <span class="Italic">Paderick v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 456 (1992), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, decided that the phrase "full and final settlement of all matters" did not preclude a subsequent fee application for the efforts of counsel up to and including the submission of the fee agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement provided that the appellant would withdraw his appeal of the agency's indefinite suspension action in return for the agency's action of restoring him to duty with back pay and overtime benefits. The appellant also agreed to withdraw his appeal of his removal and all other pending grievances and complaints in return for the agency's actions of reducing his removal to a suspension and designating him as an unassigned regular carrier with contractual bidding rights to other assignments. The appellant also agreed that supervisory instructions directed to him in the future would not necessarily be interpreted as acts of harassment. Finally, both parties agreed that any issue concerning worker's compensation would be decided outside the scope of the settlement agreement. The agreement was silent on the subject of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Settlement of an appeal by agreement between the parties before a final decision is issued by the Board does not preclude the Board from considering a motion for an award of attorney fees with respect to the matters originally appealed<span class="Italic">. Cuthbertson v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 784 F.2d 370, 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Veterans Administration,</span> 29 MSPR 641 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has further found that an appellant may specifically waive the right to attorney fees as part of the settlement of the appeal and that such a settlement provision is enforceable. <span class="Italic">Brannon v. Department of the Navy,</span> 34 MSPR 675 (1987); <span class="Italic">Bohan v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service,</span> 31 MSPR 601, 602-03 (1986). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Evans v. Jeff D.,</span> 475 U.S. 717, 106 S. Ct. 1531, 89 L. Ed.2d 747 (1986) (a plaintiff may, in a settlement agreement, waive his statutory right to seek an award of costs and attorney fees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that a settlement agreement does not preclude an appellant from seeking an award of attorney fees before the Board unless the agreement itself expresses the appellant's intent to waive his statutory right to request attorney fees or such intent can be reasonably inferred from the circumstances underlying the agreement. We therefore disagree with the administrative judge's finding that a settlement agreement that makes no mention of attorney fees, but merely provides that it is a "full and final settlement of all matters" in the appeals before the Board, constitutes a waiver of the appellant's right to seek attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he negotiating history here does not provide a basis for inferring that the appellant agreed to waive his statutory right to request an award of attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g). In this regard, we note that the agency asserted below that the settlement agreement constituted a final settlement of all "matters" before the Board and that the parties had understood that the agreement was meant to include any attorney fee request. However, counsel for the appellant responded that attorney fees were specifically excluded from and not covered by the agreement, and that such had been the understanding of the parties in negotiating the settlement. The appellant also submitted a sworn affidavit to this effect. Further, the language of the settlement agreement here did not incorporate any term such as "fees" or "damages" that would have indicated the parties' intent to waive attorney fees. There is, therefore, no clear expression of any mutual intent to include the waiver of attorney fees as among those "matters" settled by the agreement between the parties in this case. Thus, we conclude that there is an inadequate basis for the Board to infer that the term "matters" necessarily included a mutual understanding that attorney fees were to be waived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By analogy, we have repeatedly held that waiver of the statutory right to a hearing should consist of a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of the party showing a purpose or acts amounting to an estoppel on his part. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hulett v. Department of the Navy,</span> 27 MSPR 510, 512 (1985). Similarly, we conclude, a settlement agreement cannot be deemed to encompass the statutory entitlement to attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; <span id="Page_4736"></span>7701(g), unless the language of the agreement itself, or the underlying circumstances, demonstrate the intent of the prevailing party to waive that right. Therefore, in the absence of either an express waiver of the appellant's statutory right to request attorney fees or of other evidence demonstrating his intent to waive that right, the Board will deem the appellant to have retained his statutory right to request an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the settlement agreement in the instant case provided that it would constitute a "full and final settlement of all matters" relative to the appellant's appeals before the Board, it cannot be read to effect a general release of all claims by the appellant. Because the appellant did not expressly waive his right to attorney fees in the settlement agreement, and since neither the language of the agreement nor any other evidence of record can reasonably be interpreted to demonstrate his intent to waive that right, we find that he did not waive his right to request an award of attorney fees. The appellant's motion for an award of such fees therefore must be considered by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before being overruled, <span class="Italic">Rhoades</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Wilde v. Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 149, 152 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Franks v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 13 MSPR 606, 609 (1982) (no waiver of fees from language that the appellant "waives her right to seek further processing, review, or other appellate or judicial review of the matter now pending before the [Board]").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without mention of <span class="Italic">Paderick, supra,</span> the Board declined to allow a settlement itself to meet the interest of justice standard in <span class="Italic">Hillary v. Dept. of Transp</span>., DC-0432-16-0041-A-1 (NP 1/27/2023) (although another factor, gross procedural error, was considered in the decision denying fees):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant first argues that an award of attorney fees is in the interest of justice because to deny fees when the parties reach a settlement agreement but reach an impasse regarding fees would discourage settlement, which is against public policy. However, echoing the U.S. Supreme Court, the Board has found that "the purposes of settlement will largely be lost if the fees proceeding becomes the first [major litigation] in settled cases." <span class="Italic">Vann</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. at 414 n.2 (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983)). The Board has therefore emphasized "that the parties should make every effort, during the course of their negotiations, to settle any potential liability for fees as well." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Furthermore, as the administrative judge noted, the agency may have declined to settle if doing so would have required it to pay the appellant's attorney fees. Accordingly, we find the appellant's argument to be without merit. <span class="Italic">See Hutchison v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 491, 494-95 (1988) (finding that an award of attorney fees was not in the interest of justice, despite the appellant obtaining prevailing party status as a result of a settlement), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 871 F.2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Stringer v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 644, 644 n.* (1985) (finding that an agency's agreement not to oppose an appellant's request for attorney fees does not affect an appellant's burden of establishing that an award of fees is justified).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reference to the initial decision denying fees in <span class="Italic">Hillary, supra,</span> shows that the settlement agreement did not resolve issues concerning fees but provided the appellant could file a petition for fees to be considered by the Board.
