<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-185"><span class="space">A.</span> UNIT CLARIFICATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 CFR 2422.1 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What is your purpose for filing a petition?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">You, the petitioner, may file a petition for the following purposes: </p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Clarification or amendment</span>. To clarify, and/or amend: </p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;A recognition or certification then in effect; and/or </p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Any other matter relating to representation. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="italic">Consolidation</span>. To consolidate two or more units, with or without an election, in an agency where a labor organization is the exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of petitions to clarify or amend an existing certification (referred to in decisions as a CU petition) was explained by a concurring opinion of FLRA Chair Segal in <span class="Italic">SBA and Eisinger</span>, 54 FLRA 562, 567 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such petitions to clarify or amend an existing certification are filed for several purposes.&#x2003;For example, a petition to amend a certification may be aimed at modifying the wording of a certification to accommodate a nominal or technical change of an activity or exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot, Naval Air Station, Alameda, California</span>, 47 FLRA 242, 243 (1993). A petition to clarify a unit may be used to determine whether a particular position is properly included within a certification, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3723 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Navy Exchange Service Center</span>, 49 FLRA 1256, 1258 (1994), to determine whether a particular individual is included within a certificate, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Trade Commission</span>, 35 FLRA 576, 583 (1990), or to determine the proper scope of a bargaining unit after an agency reorganization of its functions. <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, 52 FLRA 950 (1997).[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Under the Authority's current regulations, any representation issue, including a request to clarify or amend a certificate, may be raised by the filing of a single petition. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.1 (1998). Prior to March 15, 1996, the Authority's regulations provided for separate petitions for these two purposes. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2422.1(d), 2422.2(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">A clarification of unit petition, initiated with the FLRA Form 21 ("Petition") covering various representation proceedings, is used to obtain a determination as to unit inclusion or exclusion of certain employees. Filing requirements are outlined in FLRA's regulations at 5 CFR 2422.1(b), 2422.2(c) (2022). Clarification may be sought by a local on behalf of a national unit if the local was delegated authority to pursue the underlying petition. That local may then pursue the continuation of a case through an application for review of the regional director's decision on the clarification petition. <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 2532</span>, 34 FLRA 392, 392 (1990). FLRA may resolve a statutory bargaining unit exclusion issue even if there was no meaningful change in the unit. <span class="Italic">See NCUA and NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 349, 351 (2005). Refer to the FLRA General Counsel's December 18, 1996, <span class="Italic">Guidance on Proper Descriptions of Bargaining Units and Identification of Parties to the Collective Bargaining Relationships in Certifications</span> [GC guidance and policy memos were rescinded in October 2006] <a href="https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Guidances/cert_guidance.htm">https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Guidances/cert_guidance.htm</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">It was FLRA's position that a petition to clarify or amend a certification of an exclusive representative could be filed only by a union or agency under the regulation. FLRA declined to permit an individual to file a petition seeking unit clarification in <span class="Italic">SBA and Eisinger</span>, 54 FLRA 562, 567-80 (1998) (separate concurring opinions of two Authority members resolving apparent conflict between statute, 5 USC 7111(b)(2), permitting a petition to be filed by any person, and regulation, 5 CFR 2422.2(c) (2022), allowing filing only by agency or labor organization). FLRA's <span class="Italic">Eisinger</span> decision was reversed on judicial review in <span class="Italic">Eisinger v. FLRA</span>, 218 F.3d 1097, 1104-05 (9th Cir. 2000), relying on 5 USC 7111(b)(2), permitting "any person" to file a petition, and 5 USC 7103(a)(1), defining a person as "an individual, labor organization, or agency." The court explained why it honored the statutory rather than the regulatory definition of persons and entities having standing to pursue a unit clarification petition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reverse the FLRA's decision on standing because its regulation contravenes the applicable statutory language. Once again, we find that the plain meaning of the statute is clear--an individual has standing to file a petition under &#x00A7; 7111.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's regulation on standing provides that "only an agency or labor organization may file a petition" to clarify or amend a unit determination. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.2(c). Although Eisinger conceded that the regulation denies him standing, he argues that the FLRA's regulation is contrary to the plain language of the statute. Section 7111(b)(2) provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">If a petition is filed with the Authority</span>--</p>
<p class="noindent-c">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">by any person</span> seeking clarification of, or an amendment to, a certification then in effect or a matter relating to representation;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">the Authority shall investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after a reasonable notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-c">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2) (emphasis added). Furthermore, Section 7103 provides definitions for the terms in &#x00A7; 7111, including a definition for "person":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this chapter--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;"person" means an <span class="Italic">individual</span> labor organization, or agency;</p>
<p class="noindent-c">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing an agency's construction of a statute that it administers, we apply the well-established test in <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the first step is "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778. The court only takes the second step ("whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute") "if the statute is silent or ambiguous." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778. Furthermore, <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> noted that we have final authority on issues of statutory construction and that "[if] a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, the intent is the law and must be given effect." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> n.9 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the statutory language permitting "any person" to file a &#x00A7; 7111 petition is neither silent nor ambiguous. "'A fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.'" <span class="Italic">United States v. Smith</span>, 155 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir. 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Perrin v. United States</span>, 444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S. Ct. 311, 62 L. Ed.2d 199 (1979)). Section 7103(a)(1), however, goes one step further by explicitly defining a "person" as an "individual, labor organization, or agency." "' As a rule, "[a] definition which declares what a term 'means'...excludes any meaning that is not stated."'" <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 155 F.3d at 1057 (quoting <span class="Italic">Colautti v. Franklin</span>, 439 U.S. 379, 392-93 n.10, 99 S. Ct. 675, 58 L. Ed.2d 596 (1979) (quoting 2A C. Sands, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 47.07 (4th ed. Supp. 1978), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by</span> <span class="Italic">Webster v. Reproductive Health Servs.</span>, 492 U.S. 490, 109 S. Ct. 3040, 106 L. Ed.2d 410 (1989))).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the intent of Congress was unambiguous.&#x2003;Congress has permitted "any person" to file a &#x00A7; 7111 petition and specifically defined a "person" as an "individual." Given the clarity of Congress's intent in this case, we will not inquire beyond the first step of the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> test. Therefore, we will not address the policy and practical considerations advanced by the FLRA. We will, however, briefly address the FLRA's textual arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the FLRA contends that &#x00A7; 7111(b) does not establish the requirements for filing representation petitions because it says "<span class="Italic">If</span> a petition is filed with the Authority..." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2) (emphasis added). This argument presumes that Congress intended for the FLRA to define what constitutes a valid petition and to define who may file it. This presumption, however, ignores the statute's plain meaning that such a petition may be filed "by any person."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the FLRA argues that the statutory definition of a "person" is stated in the disjunctive ("individual, labor organization, <span class="Italic">or</span> agency") and therefore may be limited by context. While this may be true in some cases, the argument is inapplicable here. The statutory definition expanded the traditional definition of "person" to include labor organizations and agencies. In this case, a "person" at a minimum refers to natural persons. Furthermore, the statute says--without limitation--"<span class="Italic">any</span> person," <span id="page_174"></span>suggesting that in this context either an individual, labor organization, or agency may file such a petition. The FLRA attempts to provide an alternative meaning in the face of an explicit statutory definition, thus violating the traditional canons of statutory construction. Therefore, under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the FLRA's regulation denying individuals the standing to file a &#x00A7; 7111 petition is invalid because it contravenes the unambiguous intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following reversal, FLRA remanded the <span class="Italic">Eisinger</span> case to the regional director. <span class="Italic">SBA and Eisinger</span>, 56 FLRA 926, 926 (2000). Still, under the current regulation, 5 CFR 2422.2 (2020):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="italic">Who may file a petition?</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual; a labor organization; two or more labor organizations acting as a joint-petitioner; an individual acting on behalf of any employee(s); an agency or activity; or a combination of the above may file a representation petition. But, </p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Only a labor organization may file a petition under &#x00A7; 2422.1(a)(1); </p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Only an individual may file a petition under &#x00A7; 2422.1(a)(2); and </p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;Only an agency or a labor organization may file a petition under &#x00A7; 2422.1(b) or (c).</p>
<p class="noindent">A clarification of unit petition is the proper procedure to clarify, consistent with the parties' intent, inclusions in or exclusions from a unit after resolution of the basic question of representation. When the issue is raised as to whether an individual is included in an existing unit, the CU petition should be filed in accordance with &#x00A7; 2422.2(c) of the regulations. <span class="Italic">FTC and AFGE Local 2211</span>, 35 FLRA 576, 583 (1990). A unit clarification petition is not required if the union and the agency agree that the bargaining unit description covers newly hired categories of employees covered by the existing unit. The age of the bargaining unit certification is immaterial as long as it is accurate. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq., Ft. Dix and IBPO, NAGE, SEIU</span>, 53 FLRA 287, 295 (1997). An issue concerning employee eligibility for supervisory assignments rather than unit placement is not within the scope of a CU petition. <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi Army Depot and IAM Local 2049</span>, 10 FLRA 545, 545-46 (1982). FLRA will consider a unit clarification petition concerning the status of employees specifically excluded in the existing certification if there is an intervening changed circumstance, including a statutory change. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Int'l Ass'n of Fire Fighters, Local F-123</span>, 6 FLRA 67, 68-69 (1981). If there is no change, the regional director properly considers the wording of the existing certification to determine whether employees are included in the unit. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Life Cycle Mgmt. Ctr., Hanscom AFB and NFFE Local 1384</span>, 69 FLRA 483, 486 (2016) (distinguishing phrase "duty-station at Hanscom" and union's interpretation of "assigned to.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Limitations on and other uses of the CU petition were clarified in <span class="Italic">FTC and AFGE Local 2211</span>, 35 FLRA 576, 584-86 (1990), taking guidance from NLRB decisions and determining that a union may, by filing a representation (RO) petition, seek to represent employees who were excluded from an original certification pursuant to a voluntary pre-election agreement approved by the Regional Director:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n the absence of a demonstration that meaningful changes have occurred in the job duties or functions and/or job circumstances of the affected employees, a CU petition is not appropriate for including employees who were excluded from the original certification pursuant to a voluntary pre-election agreement approved by the Regional Director because they were temporary employees, supervisors, management officials or confidential employees....&#8197;[U]nless the Union can now show that, since the original certification, there have been meaningful changes in the duties or functions of the head secretaries and lead employees or meaningful changes in the job circumstances and/or functions of the temporary employees, a CU petition is not the proper procedure to include these employees in the existing unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not addressed previously whether, or to what extent, a representation petition is appropriate to include in a unit employees who (1) were excluded from a union's original certification pursuant to a pre-election agreement approved by the Regional Director, and (2) are not part of an appropriate residual unit or any other appropriate unit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">The Washington Post Company</span>, 256 NLRB 1243 (1981), the NLRB dismissed the union's Unit Clarification (UC) Petition seeking to include in the existing unit...individuals employed in confidential secretary classifications. The NLRB found that prior to the election in the existing unit, the parties had agreed to exclude the confidential secretaries because of their alleged confidential status. A year after the existing unit was certified, the union filed a UC petition alleging that the secretaries' duties had changed significantly since their exclusion from the unit so that they were no longer confidential employees. The union also provided evidence that, at the time of the pre-election agreement, its representatives may have mistakenly believed that the confidential secretaries were confidential employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NLRB found that the union did not meet its burden of establishing significant changes "for altering the unit placement of the confidential secretaries who have been excluded historically from the unit by agreement of the parties."...&#8197;The NLRB noted that whether the confidential secretaries' exclusion was based on mistake or acquiescence, rather than express consent, was immaterial for purposes of deciding whether clarification is appropriate. The NLRB concluded that the union's UC petition raised a question concerning representation which could not be resolved in a unit clarification petition....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe that the NLRB's approach in this situation would effectuate the policies and purposes of the Statute. This approach would enable employees who were erroneously excluded from a union's original certification by a pre-election agreement, and therefore, could not be included appropriately in an existing unit pursuant to a CU petition, to exercise their rights under section 7102 of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we adopt the NLRB approach in this situation and hold that a union may, by filing an RO [certificate of representative] petition, seek to represent employees who were excluded from an original certification pursuant to a voluntary pre-election agreement approved by the Regional Director. As with RO petitions filed in other circumstances, a regional director must, as necessary, determine the employees' unit status and in addition, must determine whether all applicable requirements, such as those concerning showings of interest, have been satisfied. If the regional director determines that the applicable requirements have been satisfied, the regional director should direct an election to determine whether the petitioned-for employees (1) desire to be represented by the certified exclusive representative in the existing unit or (2) desire to remain unrepresented.</p>

<p class="noindent">Distinguishing petitions to amend certifications of recognition and petitions to clarify units, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, U.S. Mint and AFGE</span>, 32 FLRA 508, 510 (1988), reviewed a decision concerning the unit status of temporary employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In filing the AC petition, the Union sought to amend the unit description to exclude temporary employees who are employed up to 700 hours and have no reasonable expectation of reappointment....&#8197;An AC petition is not the appropriate vehicle to obtain the result sought by the Union. An AC petition is intended to accommodate a nominal or technical change of an activity or exclusive representative....&#8197;Rather a CU petition is the appropriate vehicle for resolving the bargaining unit status of temporary employees. A CU petition is intended to clarify, consistent with the parties' intent, the unit inclusions or exclusions after the basic question of representation has been resolved....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA went on to resolve the unit issue, <span class="Italic">U.S. Mint</span>, 32 FLRA at 511:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, although the Union filed an inappropriate petition, the record reflects that the Union was seeking to clarify the bargaining unit status <span id="page_175"></span>of temporary employees. In our view, the purposes and policies of the Statute would not be promoted by dismissing the petition at this post-hearing stage on the sole basis that the Petitioner filed the wrong petition, particularly in view of the Union's clear intent. Accordingly, we shall consider the AC petition in this case as if it had been filed as a CU petition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Clarification of a unit, rather than accretion (depending on a "triggering event") was deemed the appropriate analysis for a group of demonstration project employees whose positions' duties were similar to those of employees in the established unit, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Crane Div., and AFGE</span>, 69 FLRA 404, 404, 406 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Union petitioned the RD, under &#x00A7; 7111(b) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute), to include--through the Authority's accretion doctrine--approximately 430 non-professional Demonstration Project (Demo Project) employees (the Demo Project employees) at the Agency in an existing bargaining unit (unit) represented by AFGE, Local 1415. Absent a finding of accretion, the Union requested that the RD clarify the unit and amend the unit certification based on the Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Relations' (Assistant Secretary's) decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Aeronautical Systems Division, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span> (Wright-Patterson).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;5 A/SLMR 734 (1975).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, as relevant here, the union represented a bargaining unit of all "non-supervisory wage[-]board [(WB)] personnel." The agency promoted a group of WB employees to GS positions, and then abolished the newly promoted employees' WB positions. The union petitioned the Assistant Secretary to clarify the status of the promoted employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether to clarify the unit to include the promoted employees, the Assistant Secretary did not conduct an accretion analysis.[22] Rather, the Assistant Secretary based his decision on his findings that (1) "despite the change in the designation and method of compensation," the promoted employees "[we]re performing essentially the same duties that they performed as WB employees"; (2) the promoted employees "continued to work at the same physical location...and...continue[d]...to work closely with WB employees"; and (3) the promoted employees "continue[d] to share a clear and identifiable community of interest with the WB employees."[23] Based on these findings, the Assistant Secretary clarified the existing bargaining unit to include the promoted employees.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Assistant Secretary's failure to apply an accretion analysis in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> was not because the accretion doctrine had yet to be developed. Indeed, the Assistant Secretary applied a form of accretion in one of the first decisions issued after he assumed responsibility for overseeing a portion of the federal-sector labor-management-relations program,[25] and he applied the accretion doctrine in cases decided at the same time as <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>.[26] Additionally, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had applied the accretion doctrine for many years before the Assistant Secretary decided <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>.[27]</p>

<p class="noindent">In one CU petition, FLRA reorganized unit structures to honor the wishes of all parties.
