<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-211"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> </span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 9 MSPR 268 (1981), clarified the essential pre-WPA causation analysis in adverse action appeals involving claims of reprisal for protected conduct and invidious discrimination. The case involved the removal of an EEO specialist who alleged that the action was in reprisal for use of a grievance procedure. The Board explained the burden of proof. To establish a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9), involving reprisal for filing a grievance, the appellant was required to demonstrate that she engaged in an activity protected by that section; she subsequently was treated in an adverse fashion by the employer; the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge that the employee engaged in protected activity; there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action; and the protected activity was a significant factor in the taking of the adverse action. As to the significance of the protected activity or the causation of the adverse action, the Board observed that the agency failed to use progressive discipline for relatively minor deficiencies and that the discipline of removal far outweighed the actionable conduct. Given the factual findings of the AJ on the other elements of proof, the Board concluded that the protected conduct was a significant factor in the decision to remove the appellant. The Board then had to determine whether, under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(B), the action of the agency was based on a prohibited personnel practice, i.e., the Board was required to define the degree of impermissible taint necessary to establish that the personnel action was based upon a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reviewing the legislative history, the Board decided in <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> that the customary definition of "based" connoted that the matter referred to was the most important element. The Board drew meaning from the history of the Reform Act, drafted both to protect employees from prohibited personnel practices and to preclude their insulation from legitimate disciplinary or performance based actions. The Board determined, on the basis of its review of the Act and the legislative history, that 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(B) mandated reversal of the agency's action only if it were determined that a prohibited personnel practice was the "motivating factor" or "real reason" for the agency action. The Board went on to define how improper motivation could be established. The analysis of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), was adopted as an analytical model. Under the model the employee first has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected conduct was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor. Second, if the employee meets this burden, the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place. This approach was not intended to dictate the order of presentation of evidence, and it was not expected to result in alteration of the routine hearing process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Having concluded in <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> that the discipline taken against the appellant for minor misconduct was far greater than the discipline applied to an employee responsible for far graver misconduct, the Board inferred that the appellant would not have been removed had there been no retaliatory motive on the part of the appellant's supervisor, the proposing official. The removal was reversed. In footnote 13, the Board stated that it was irrelevant that the agency could possibly have taken some lesser action against the appellant on the basis of the sustained specifications; the question was whether the agency would have removed the appellant had there been no retaliatory intent. By this notation, the Board implied that a finding of a prohibited personnel practice would require reversal of an action, not mitigation to a penalty matching the proved misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> referred to <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), a First Amendment case involving a teacher who asserted that his contract was not renewed because of his advocacy on behalf of a teachers' organization. Considering the burden of proof to demonstrate that the nonrenewal was constitutionally tainted, the Court declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A rule of causation which focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a part, "substantial" or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire, could place an employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing. The difficulty with the rule enunciated by the District Court is that it would require reinstatement in cases where a dramatic and perhaps abrasive incident is inevitably on the minds of those responsible for the decision to rehire, and does indeed play a part in that decision--even if the same decision would have been reached had the incident not occurred. The constitutional principle at stake is sufficiently vindicated if such an employee is placed in no worse a position than if he had not engaged in the conduct. A borderline or marginal candidate should not have the employment question resolved against him because of constitutionally protected conduct. But that same candidate ought not to be able, by engaging in such conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire on the basis of that record, simply because the protected conduct makes the employer more certain of the correctness of its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is especially true where, as...here, the current decision to rehire will accord "tenure." The long-term consequences of an award of tenure are of great moment both to the employee and to the employer. They are too significant for us to hold that the Board in this case would be precluded, because it considered constitutionally protected conduct in deciding not to rehire Doyle, from attempting to prove to a trier of fact that quite apart from such conduct Doyle's record was such that he would not have been rehired in any event.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, in this case, the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that his conduct was a "substantial factor"--or, to put it in other words, that it was a "motivating factor" in the Board's decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent's reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As to pre-WPA cases, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of State</span>, 9 MSPR 363, 367 (1982), reiterated that <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), applied in OSC mixed motive cases. In <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>, the Court held that an employer that did not renew a school teacher's contract in reprisal for her exercise of free speech rights could still prevail if it could prove that it would not have renewed her contract regardless of her protected conduct. The Board observed that employees engaged in misconduct should not be protected from adverse actions. It ruled that it would follow the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> analysis and reverse a disciplinary action only if the prohibited conduct was the "motivating factor" or "real reason" for the agency action. An employee would not be protected if he blew the whistle on his agency after the agency had begun to initiate disciplinary action not motivated by reprisal. The <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test was adopted by the National Labor Relations Board in unfair labor practice cases prosecuted by its General Counsel. <span class="Italic">Wright Line, A Division of Wright Line, Inc.</span>, 105 LRRM 1169 (1980). The Board considered the functions of the NLRB <span id="Page_4027"></span>and the MSPB, and the NLRB General Counsel and OSC, sufficiently analogous to justify reliance on the Labor Board's use of the <span class="Italic">Mt.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 16 MSPR 178, 188 &#x0026; n.13 (1983), determined that OSC demonstrated that retaliation against an employee who filed an EEO complaint more likely than not played a significant part in the proposed removal. Management, however, demonstrated legitimate reasons, e.g., insubordination and poor performance, for its actions. Once dual motivation was shown, <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> was applied. Under this test, it was insufficient to show that there was a good reason for the personnel action. The real test was whether the same personnel decision would have been made had there been no illegitimate reason for the action. The initiator of the adverse action, the appellant's supervisor, was not concerned about the appellant's EEO activities, although the individual who ultimately proposed the removal, a higher-level manager, was concerned about the EEO activities. The supervisor provided evidence that the appellant was not producing acceptable work product. The Board concluded that no matter what her dissatisfaction might be with her assigned work or with her supervisor, the appellant was obliged to do her work while she pursued her EEO complaints. As a matter of practice, the proposing official backed up his subordinate supervisor, whom he knew had sound reasons to initiate the proposal. It was more likely than not that the official would have proposed the appellant's removal without regard to her EEO activities. The Board found no prohibited personnel practice and noted that the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> rule was to avoid the unfairness of placing an employee who engaged in protected conduct in a better position than he would otherwise have enjoyed had he engaged only in the conduct that was a valid cause of the personnel decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of State</span>, 9 MSPR 363, 371 (1982), described the allocation of proof for Special Counsel cases involving mixed motives:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...First, the Special Counsel has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected conduct was a "significant factor" in the challenged agency action. If the Special Counsel meets this burden, the burden shifts to the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action regardless of the protected conduct.[16] It is our intention that the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test be used in corrective action proceedings just as it will be used in appeals, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, as a method of allocating the burdens of proof and as an analytical tool for determining ultimate causality, and not as a method of dictating the order of presentation of evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16]&#x2003;Proof that an agency <span class="Italic">could</span> possibly have taken some action against the employee on the basis of any sustained charge is irrelevant in such cases. The burden on the agency is to prove that, regardless of any proven retaliatory intent, it <span class="Italic">would</span> have taken the challenged action against the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As the footnote states, the agency had to prove that it would have taken the same action had the protected conduct not taken place, a finding different than a determination that the agency could have taken the same action. Having proceeded with improper motivation, the agency created for itself a greater burden to overcome than having to show that certain behavior can be dealt with in the manner chosen. Although the Board did not explain what type of proof an agency might offer to avoid a finding of reprisal, it was reasonable to expect that the required showing could be made by demonstrating one or more circumstances: that other employees accused of the same or similar offenses but not engaged in protected conduct were disciplined in like manner; that a table of penalties supported the discipline applied; that the particular behavior was so serious that reasonable people would agree that the chosen discipline was necessary even without the prohibited motive; or that the agency mitigated the penalty during its internal consideration of the action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spadaro v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 18 MSPR 462, 464-66 (1983), evaluated the agency's means of proving that it would have taken an action absent prohibited considerations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> rule adopted by the Board in <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> established a two-part test for dual motivation cases which allocates burdens of proof between the parties. After the agency proves its charge, the employee in a dual motivation case first has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected conduct was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor for the agency's action. If the employee carries that burden and thus establishes his affirmative defense, the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence "that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not place." <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> at 604.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first part of the <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> test was elaborated upon in <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 159 (1979), in which the Board set forth the elements necessary to prove that an agency acted against an employee in reprisal for engaging in protected conduct. According <span class="Italic">to Frazier,</span> there must be a showing that the employee engaged in a protected activity; that he or she was treated adversely by the agency; that the agency deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the protected activity; that the protected activity and the adverse action were causally connected; and that the protected activity was a significant factor in taking the adverse action. 1 MSPB at 186; <span class="Italic">accord, Gerlach.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official concluded, and the Board agrees, that "the appellant demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that retaliation was a significant factor" in the adverse action. However, in his application of the second part of the test, the presiding official found "that the agency <span class="Italic">could</span> have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place." The substitution of the words "could have" for "would have" in the determination of the propriety of the agency's action against the employee fundamentally changes the meaning of the agency evidentiary burden. The test under <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> is more than whether an agency could have imposed a certain action. Rather, the agency must show that it would have, in fact, imposed the chosen discipline on the particular person under all the particular circumstances, absent the prohibited motivation. Having proceeded with improper motivation, the agency has created for itself a greater hurdle to overcome than merely having to show that certain behavior can be dealt with in the manner chosen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official's finding that the agency could have taken the adverse action even if the protected conduct had not taken place is not determinative of the outcome of this case. The agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that this appellant, in this branch of this agency, with its own history of disciplining employees for similar infractions, would, in fact, have received the discipline imposed absent the protected conduct. The record in this case does not support such a finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because circumstances surrounding dual motivation cases are highly individualized, the types of evidence which might serve to meet an agency's burden also will vary with each case. For example, the agency might show that other employees who were accused of the same or similar offenses but who had not engaged in protected activities were disciplined in a like manner. The agency could also demonstrate that a table of penalties in use at the agency supports the discipline applied to the particular offense. In the case of problem behavior which is unique in the agency's experience, the agency might attempt to show that the particular behavior is of such a serious nature that reasonable people could not differ with the conclusion that the chosen discipline was necessary even if the prohibited motive did not exist. The agency in this case failed to establish that any of these reasons for the particular adverse action existed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency also might attempt to show that it would have acted as it did even absent the prohibited motive by showing that it mitigated the penalty for the appellant....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of the <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> analysis of rebuttal evidence was provided by <span class="Italic">Clark v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 348, 350-51 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if an inference of retaliatory or discriminatory motive could be shown so as to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, appellant would still not prevail. In <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade</span> <span class="Italic">Commission</span>, 8 MSPB 599 at 604 (1981), the Board held that an appellant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the alleged prohibited personnel practice was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor before the burden shifts to the agency to prove by preponderant evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the protected activity had not taken place. In the instant case the agency not only articulated a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its decision to remove appellant, it proved all charges against him by a preponderance of the evidence. The record contains no evidence that the agency's action was pretextual. Thus, even assuming a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, appellant did not establish that reprisal or discrimination was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Walden v. OPM</span>, 14 MSPR 378, 381 (1983), a disciplinary case concluding that even if the appellant demonstrated discrimination, he could not prevail because the agency would have taken the same action had the appellant not been black and had he not participated in the activities of a civil rights organization. <span class="Italic">Dunning v. NASA</span>, 10 MSPR 183, 186 (1982), referred to the <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> test as whether "the protected conduct was a substantial motivating factor in the agency's decision," although the correct parsing of <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> was "substantial" <span class="Italic">or</span> "motivating." <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 9 MSPR at 275; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ketchum v. FAA</span>, 28 MSPR 268, 274 &#x0026; n.3 (1985) (a Chapter 43 case: assuming a demonstration that protected activity was a motivating factor, the agency showed by preponderant evidence that it would have removed the appellant based on having proven, by substantial evidence, that performance was unsatisfactory).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board attempted to clarify--at least simplify--its definition of causal connection in <span class="Italic">McClellan v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 237 (1984). Causal connection <span id="Page_4028"></span>consisted of an inference of retaliatory motive for the adverse action, established in almost all situations by circumstantial evidence. In a reprisal case involving an individual who filed an EEO complaint, the demonstration of causal connection could consist of an inference of a retaliatory motive drawn from circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 16 MSPR 178, 184 (1983). <span class="Italic">McClellan</span> concluded that, as to the quantum of proof needed to establish a case, if the employee demonstrated that reprisal for the filing of grievances was a substantial factor (shown by threats to the appellant concerning his grievances, by requests to the union president to have the appellant back off, and by the firing of an employee for a heated but trivial remark to a supervisor), the burden of proof was upon the agency to show that it would have taken the adverse action had the protected conduct not occurred. If the discipline was for minor conduct not ordinarily subject to severe sanctions, particularly when viewed relative to discipline of others for similar offenses, the inference was that the action was a prohibited personnel practice if the other elements of the affirmative defense were present. The Board commented in <span class="Italic">McClellan</span> that if an emergency suspension was found to be retaliatory, the inference was that the removal that followed was also unlawfully tainted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again outlined the burdens of proof in <span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 428, 431 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal under section 2302(b)(9), an appellant must demonstrate that he engaged in an activity protected by that section; that he subsequently was treated in an adverse fashion by the employer; that the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge that the employee was engaged in the protected activity; and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.... If the appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and the agency demonstrates legitimate managerial reasons for its action, the Board will apply the two-part test enunciated in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span>...for deciding dual motivation cases.... Once dual motivation is established, the employee must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected conduct was a "substantial" or "motivating" factor in the action. Then the burden shifts to the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the protected conduct had not taken place.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was sustained in <span class="Italic">Gady v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 118, 121 (1988), following a brief <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span> analysis. Although the appellant's complaints concerning the agency's smoking policy qualified for protection under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A), the agency demonstrated that due to the appellant's stress-related medical disability, she could not perform her work and was properly removed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions still emphasize motivational analysis when an appellant claims reprisal for filing an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Shelly v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 75 MSPR 677, 680 (1997), declined to endorse a reprisal defense because those involved in the action against the appellant were not shown to have "had any motive for retaliating against the appellant for her EEO activity." The individuals involved were not the ones whom appellant had accused of wrongdoing. Citing <span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the Board concluded that there was no "genuine nexus between her EEO activity and her removal."</p>
