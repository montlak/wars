<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-518"><span class="space">G.</span> BUILDING AND OFFICE DESIGN</h3>
<p class="noindent">Proposals concerning reductions in space, space allocation, arrangement of space, furniture, equipment to be used by employees and information related to those matters requested by the union for use in negotiations involve working conditions of employees within the duty to bargain unless the agency demonstrates the proposals are inconsistent with law and regulation. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 21 FLRA 1124, 1126 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2050 and EPA</span>, 39 FLRA 291 (1991) (negotiations concerning relocation of employees: proposals were negotiable calling for relocation of employees to offices with window space, requiring automatic garage doors with alarm system, and requiring offices have doors with combination locks).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7106(b)(1), the agency may elect to bargain over the technology, methods, and means of performing work, or the agency may elect not to bargain on that topic. A proposal concerning office space design violates an agency's right to determine the technology of performing work only if the agency shows that its choice of office space design has a technological relation to the accomplishment and furtherance of its work, and the proposal interferes with these purposes. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, OSHA</span>, 21 FLRA 658, 660 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2544 and DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, </span>46 FLRA 930, 942-50, 960-62 (1992) (Proposals 1 and 11: FLRA rejected argument that technological relation existed between proposed building expansion, its configuration, and performance of agency work; Proposal 6 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2544</span> was negotiable: "All walls will be paneled to match existing paneling."). Without a specific cite to a controlling, contrary government-wide regulation, a proposal was negotiable that employees retain their present space allocations following a reorganization and transfer of functions within the agency. FLRA also rejected an argument that the proposal violated management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. The proposal did not interfere with the agency's ability to adopt a functional grouping for the performance of work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 FLRA 363, 369 (1987) (proposals concerning location of private offices, blockage of window areas, and location of employee work areas near windows were negotiable); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 26 FLRA 768, 773-74 (1987) (Proposal 10) (negotiable: proposal that employees retain their present space allocations after transfer of functions).</p>
<p class="noindent">Government-wide space management regulations may also determine negotiability. A proposal was inconsistent with GSA space management regulations, considered government-wide regulations and nonnegotiable that precluded the agency from changing or reducing average space of its unit employees and precluded the agency from achieving GSA's goals concerning space utilization. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 19 FLRA 161 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 FLRA 363, 366-68 (1987) (Proposal 5).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals concerning office conditions, e.g., lighting, acoustics, and the height of partitions, were negotiable. They had no effect on the selection by management of the technology to do work. <span class="Italic">NTEU and NTEU Chap. 80 and <span id="page_1005"></span>Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Cent. Region</span>, 8 FLRA 197, 198 (1982). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 717 F.2d 1174, 1175, 1177 (7th Cir. 1983) (denying enforcement of bargaining order over office design because effect of transfer of 62 employees into space previously used by 50 employees was, according to court, not material change in working conditions). Office design proposals concerning partitions were negotiable. Although the agency argued that the agency plan was necessary to the technology or performance of agency work, there was no nexus shown between the desire of the agency for open workspace and the furtherance of accomplishment of agency work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MHSA</span>, 15 FLRA 902, 902-03 (1984). Office size is not part of the technical method used by the agency for accomplishing or furthering its work absent some contrary showing by the agency. The placement of equipment and facilities, however, would be a matter requiring negotiations on the technology of performing work. A proposal drafted more narrowly, to avoid inclusion of equipment or facilities not constituting part of the technical method used by the agency for performing work, would be negotiable. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2477 and Library of Congress</span>, 7 FLRA 578, 583-84 (1982), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1983). A proposal to establish private offices was negotiable when an agency did not demonstrate that an open space approach to office design had any technological relation to accomplishing or furthering performance of its work. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 95</span>, 9 FLRA 648, 650-51 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1812 and Broadcasting Bd. of Governors</span>, 59 FLRA 447, 449-50 (2003), determined to be nonnegotiable Proposal 2, describing the dimensions and use of workspace partitions. The proposed design requirements impacted the agency's ability to perform its work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that Proposals 2 and 3 are negotiable only at its election because they concern a method or means of performing its work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has established a specific test for determining whether a matter concerns the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). Under that test, it must be shown that the proposal concerns a "method" or "means" as defined by the Authority. It must also be shown that: (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular method and means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Council of GSA Locals, Council 236</span>, 55 FLRA 449, 452 (1999), petition for review denied sub nom. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of GSA Locals, Council 236 v. FLRA</span>, Case No. 99-1244 (D.C. Cir. March 7, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that, under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, it has the right to decide whether to use partitions, or the size of any partitions chosen, in configuring its work space. The disputed proposals require the Agency to use partitions to separate employee work stations. The proposals also require that those partitions be at least 5 feet (60 inches) high.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the partitions that it currently uses to separate employee work stations--44 inch-high partitions between cubicles that face each other, and 42 inch-high partitions between side-by-side cubicles--facilitate its news broadcast operations. Specifically, the Agency states that its news operations are fast-paced and rapidly changing. The Agency maintains that lower partitions allow supervisors and editors to determine whether broadcast personnel who are scheduled to go on the air are at their work stations, permits editors to conduct quick conferences among personnel at a number of work stations all at once, and makes it possible for employees to talk directly to each other without having to leave their work stations. In sum, the Agency explains, the lower partitions are more commensurate with the needs of its news broadcast operations because they make it possible to respond more quickly to the ever-changing flow of the news. The Agency contends that the 5 foot partitions required by the proposals would impede the ability to supervise and communicate made possible by the lower partitions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's explanation of the function of the lower partitions in its broadcasting operations establishes that those partitions are a tool or device that is employed for particular purposes in those operations and that they concern the method by which the Agency conducts its broadcasting operations. That is, the Agency has shown that the proposals concern what it uses to perform its broadcasting work and how it goes about performing that work. Thus, by requiring the use of partitions and specifying the height of the partitions to be used, the proposals concern the methods and means whereby the Agency accomplishes its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency has shown that there is a direct and integral relationship between the use of the lower partitions and the accomplishment of its work, namely, those partitions facilitate the supervision of, and the rapid communication required by, its news broadcast operations. Finally, the Agency has demonstrated that the higher partitions called for by the proposals would directly interfere with the mission-related purposes for which the lower partitions are employed. As there is no evidence to the contrary in the record, the Agency has established that Proposals 2 and 3 concern the methods and means of performing its work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that Proposals 2 and 3 concern the methods and means of performing work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. For this reason, it is unnecessary to address whether the proposals also constitute a matter related to the technology of performing work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. We therefore conclude that the proposals are negotiable only at the election of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA</span>, 66 FLRA 112, 115-17 (2011), presented analysis of a union's plan for office design, developed when the agency was moving a field office, and resolved to be nonnegotiable as an arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal concerns the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union disagrees with the Agency's (b)(1) argument because, according to the Union, it "never alleged that its proposal was a (b)(1) proposal." Where a union files a negotiability petition alleging that a disputed proposal concerns a (b)(1) matter, the Authority may examine the Union's argument to determine whether the proposal is negotiable at the agency's election under (b)(1). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council of Prison Locals, Local 171</span>, 52 FLRA 1484, 1498-1503 (1997). In addition, where an agency asserts that a proposal excessively interferes with management's (b)(1) rights, the Authority may examine that assertion even though the proposing union does not rely on (b)(1) to argue that the proposal is electively negotiable. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 616-18 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Nat'l Council</span>). Thus, either party to a negotiability dispute may raise (b)(1) matters in its arguments to the Authority. Consequently, although the Union does not rely on (b)(1) to argue that the proposal is electively negotiable, we address the Agency's (b)(1) argument. <span class="Italic">E.g., id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two prongs to the Authority's test used to determine whether a proposal concerns the methods or means of performing work under (b)(1). First, the proposal must concern a "method" or "means" as defined by the Authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 54 FLRA 1582, 1589 (1998) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>). In this regard, the Authority construes the term "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work" and the term "means" to refer to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1589-90 (citations and footnote omitted). Second, it must be shown that: (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular methods or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1590 (citing <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Ariz. Army Chapter 61</span>, 48 FLRA 412, 420 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the relative importance of particular methods or means of performing work is irrelevant to a determination of whether a proposal concerns the right to determine the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 407-08 (1990). In other words, an asserted method or means need not be indispensable to the accomplishment of an Agency's mission to come within the meaning of (b)(1). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Rather, it need only be "used to attain or make more likely the attainment of a desired end." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2441 v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 178, 186 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">N.Y. Council, Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502, 509-10 (2d Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency emphasizes that efficient services are essential for fulfilling its mission to serve the public.&#x2003;In that regard, the Agency explains that it has a policy not to use hybrid FEI floor plans in offices with fewer than eight employees because such a setup is inefficient and insecure. The table listing all of the Agency's Boston-region offices along with their staff complements and types of floor plans shows that the smallest offices using a hybrid FEI setup have nine employees, and the Union concedes that there are no offices the size of Newport--which has only six employees--currently using FEI workstations. In addition, although the Union argues that K1-95 workstations have adequate work surfaces and storage space to serve as FEI workstations, the Union does not dispute the Agency's assertion that the workstations that the Agency plans to mount against the IBPW--the MA-95s--have more work surfaces and storage space than the K1-95. The Agency contends that these features of the MA-95 allow for more secure document storage at the IBPW-mounted workstations and facilitate quick transitions between interviewing and non-interviewing work. Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency's explanation of its decision to use a single-workstation setup in general, and the MA-95 workstations in particular, establishes that the Agency's determinations in these matters concern the methods and means by which the Agency conducts its work operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency explains how the single-workstation setup serves as the method by which the Agency performs its work in offices with fewer than eight employees. The Agency also explains how the single-workstation setup, as used in all of the Agency's offices with fewer than eight employees, functions as a "plan[ ] or policy...for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work" with the public. <span class="Italic">See GSA</span>, 54 <span id="page_1006"></span>FLRA at 1589-90. In addition, the Agency details its reasons for selecting the particular tools and devices that make up the MA-95 workstation, rather than the K1-95 workstation, for mounting against the IBPW, and, in that regard, the Agency also explains how the MA-95 workstations enable the Agency to fulfill its mission to serve the public in an office with only six employees. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Consequently, we find that the Agency's explanation of its chosen methods and means establishes a direct and integral relationship between those particular methods and means and the accomplishment of the Agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See GSA</span>, 54 FLRA at 1590.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute the Agency's contention that switching back and forth between workstations to perform different tasks will consume more work time than what is required to transition between tasks in a single-workstation environment. Moreover, the Agency asserts, and the Union does not dispute, that an FEI workstation works more efficiently in offices larger than Newport because larger staff complements allow employees to work for extended periods without interruption at either an FEI or a back end workstation, whereas the six Newport employees would need to spend more work time frequently moving among workstations to staff the FEI area when needed. As for the choice of the MA-95 workstation rather than the K1-95, the Agency provides design drawings, the accuracy of which the Union does not dispute, showing that the MA-95 provides more work surfaces and secure storage space than the K1-95, <span class="Italic">see </span>SOP, Attach., Ex. 1 (design drawing of K1-95); SOP, Attach., Ex. 2 (design drawing of MA-95), and the Agency explains how those features directly relate to employees' accomplishment of their various interviewing and non-interviewing work assignments. Finally, the Agency explains how the proposal's complete elimination of the single-workstation setup--as well as the proposal's replacement of the IBPW-mounted, MA-95 workstations with K1-95 workstations--would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the Agency chose those particular methods and means. <span class="Italic">See GSA</span>, 54 FLRA at 1590. Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has demonstrated that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purposes for which the method or means was adopted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that, by requiring the use of a hybrid FEI workstation setup with IBPW-mounted, K1-95 workstations, the proposal concerns the methods and means of performing the Agency's work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>).[9] Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 31; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Council</span>, 58 FLRA at 617-18 (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991)). If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right(s). <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;In this regard, we note that the <span class="Italic">NWSEO </span>standard cited by the Union was set forth by a reviewing court and applied by the Authority as the non-precedential "law of the case," not adopted by the Authority as an alternative standard for determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">See NWSEO</span>, 64 FLRA at 571. We also note that, in decisions subsequent to <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>, the Authority has continued to apply the <span class="Italic">KANG </span>standard, not the <span class="Italic">NWSEO </span>standard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 142, 146 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that replacing the single-workstation setup with the hybrid FEI floor plan would benefit employees in several ways. Specifically, the Union claims that employees would not: (1) "lose their ergonomic workstations"; (2) "los[e]...personal privacy"; (3) suffer from increased exposure to noise and infectious diseases from the waiting room adjacent to the IBPW-mounted workstations; (4) lose the dedicated reception area; and (5) have to stare at a "hole in the wall" all day. The Agency disputes the first and second of these alleged adverse effects, and it disputes that its plan would increase employees' exposure to noise. Moreover, the Agency argues without contradiction that Newport employees already work in a single-workstation environment. Even assuming that the proposal constitutes an arrangement under (b)(3), <span class="Italic">e.g., AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 65 FLRA 836, 841 (2011) (assuming arrangement in <span class="Italic">KANG </span>analysis), and that the proposal would have the benefits that the Union alleges, for the following reasons, we find that the proposal is not "appropriate" within the meaning of (b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the burdens on management's exercise of its rights, as discussed above, <span class="Italic">supra </span>Part IV.D.1., the proposal would totally eliminate the single-workstation setup chosen by the Agency, and it would replace the Agency's preferred IBPW-mounted, MA-95 workstations with K1-95 workstations. Thus, the proposal would essentially negate the Agency's determinations entirely. In addition, the Agency asserts that the proposal would lessen the Newport office's ability to fulfill its mission to serve the public efficiently in several ways that the Union does not dispute. Specifically, the Agency asserts that: (1) the six employees in the Newport office will use more work time frequently switching between stations--during which they will not be performing assigned work--than would be the case in a larger office that uses an FEI setup; (2) employees who have two different workstations cannot transition between work tasks as quickly as those who remain at a single workstation for all of their work tasks; and (3) employees at the IBPW-mounted workstations will have fewer work surfaces and less secure storage space at the K1-95 workstations than they would have at the MA-95 workstations that the Agency selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After weighing the alleged benefits afforded to employees--several of which the Agency disputes--against the burdens on management's rights to determine the methods and means of performing work, we find that the burdens on management's rights outweigh the benefits to employees. Thus, the proposal excessively interferes with management's exercise of its (b)(1) rights and is not an appropriate arrangement under (b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals are negotiable to the extent the agency has discretion in design or recommendations for building design and to the extent that the design requests from the union relate to working conditions. Examples include placement of telephones, use of office doors, use of ceiling partitions, availability of showers and changing areas, conformance of structures to fire code and federal regulations, and the operational date of a first aid facility. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2477 and Library of Congress</span>, 7 FLRA 578 (1982), <span class="Italic">enf'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1285 (D.C. Cir. 1983). A proposal was negotiable that agency correct the ventilation problems of the office to the extent of the agency's discretion, even if that discretion is limited to requesting GSA to correct the problem. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 95</span>, 9 FLRA 648, 651 (1982) (ALJ Decision). Another negotiable proposal called for suitable air conditioning and heat for all working areas. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 27 FLRA 375, 382-83 (1987) (Proposal 7).</p>
<p class="noindent">Matters closely related to building design are negotiable, including a proposal that loading and unloading space be provided in an accessible area as near to the building as possible. The purpose of the proposal was to minimize the distance that bargaining unit employees were required to carry mine inspection equipment. It did not interfere with the agency's right to decide the technical means and methods of accomplishing its mission. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 27 FLRA 375, 377-78 (1987) (Proposal 2).</p>
