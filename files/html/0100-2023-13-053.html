<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-54"><span class="space">a.</span> Hearing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine whether there should be a jurisdictional hearing on an alleged involuntary retirement, the AJ should examine only the nonfrivolous allegations by the appellant. Contradiction and contradictory evidence from the agency is reserved to the time of the jurisdictional hearing, assuming that the appellant has pleaded a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> jurisdictional showing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Aldredge v. TVA</span>, 70 MSPR 141, 145-46 (1996). Several decisions illustrate the justification for a hearing. The AJ should convene a hearing if the allegation is that an appellant involuntarily retired because of harassment from his supervisor. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 272, 273 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Murray v. DMA</span>, 1 MSPR 350, 351, 1 MSPB 338 (1980), the appellant alleged that he had involuntarily <span id="Page_1980"></span>retired, having been forced to make a decision of whether to retire or be fired in less than a day. The AJ reviewed unsworn statements in the record and found that the retirement was voluntary. The Board remanded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since an involuntary retirement is tantamount to a removal, a hearing is required here to resolve this disputed factual issue. <span class="Italic">See Bell v. Groak,</span> 371 F.2d 202, 204 (7th Cir. 1966); <span class="Italic">cf. Goodman v. United States,</span> 358 F.2d 532, 533 (D.C. Cir. 1965); <span class="Italic">Dabney v. Freman,</span> 358 F.2d 533, 535 (D.C. Cir. 1965).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because an involuntary retirement is tantamount to a removal, a hearing is required to determine voluntariness if the facts are in dispute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McGowan v. Int'l Communications Agency</span>, 3 MSPR 83, 87, 2 MSPB 198 (1980) ("As the presiding official acknowledged, an involuntary retirement, wrongfully coerced by an agency, has been recognized by the courts to be tantamount to such an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Roskos v. United States</span>, 549 F.2d 1386, 1389 (Ct. Cl. 1977). If appellant's response to the motion to dismiss raises non-frivolous allegations of the involuntariness of his separation from the agency, the issue has been held to warrant a hearing. <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 MSPB 307 (1980). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gratehouse v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1104, 1108 (Ct. Cl. 1975); <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 378 (1974); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Groak</span>, 371 F.2d 202, 204 (7th Cir. 1966); <span class="Italic">Goodman v. United States</span>, 358 F.2d 532, 533 (D.C. Cir. 1966); <span class="Italic">Dabney v. Freeman</span>, 358 F.2d 533, 535 (D.C. Cir. 1965)."). A hearing was required for an appellant who alleged that he retired because his supervisors told him that he was "hanging on too long" and that he should resign or retire or the supervisors were going to make an example of him. <span class="Italic">Buono v. DMA</span>, 21 MSPR 286, 287 (1984). The appellant was improperly denied a hearing on an involuntary retirement claim when the AJ summarily resolved a dispute between the appellant and the agency over the effective date of his retirement and the related problem of the appellant's ability to contest a RIF separation. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 23 MSPR 532, 534 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bomer v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 369, 371-72 (1993), reviewed nonfrivolous allegations of an involuntary retirement warranting a hearing against the agency's defense that the retirement resulted from good reason for a proposed adverse action. The Board faulted its AJ for making credibility determinations and weighing evidence. The AJ should only have examined the appellant's nonfrivolous allegations. Evaluation of evidence awaited the hearing that the Board directed on remand:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant contended that her supervisors engaged in a continual pattern of harassment designed to coerce her into retiring. Among other things, she specifically asserted that Mr. Gatlin required her to perform work usually performed by lower-graded employees, refused her repeated requests for reassignment, asked her when she was going to quit or retire, called her an old woman, and said he would get rid of her. She also asserted that the personnel office erroneously informed her that she would not be able to maintain her health insurance benefits if she were removed.... Thus, the appellant's argument concerning jurisdiction was nonfrivolous because it was based on more than mere conclusory allegations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Waldau v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 193, 195 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the administrative judge proceeded to consider the appellant's arguments and the evidence and argument submitted by the agency to make factual findings concerning the weight of the evidence. For example, he rejected the appellant's assertion that she was coerced into retiring because of harassment by agency employees. He found that where an employee retires in lieu of removal, she must show that the agency knew that the reason for the threatened removal could not be substantiated in making an allegation of involuntariness. He concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Consequently, in light of the appellant's admissions and the apparently credible statements from fellow employees who witnessed the conduct described in the proposal notice, I find that the agency had reasonable grounds for the charges that it levied against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the appellant's disciplinary record and the seriousness of the charges, the administrative judge also found that the agency had reasonable grounds for proposing the penalty of removal. Thus, he concluded that notwithstanding the alleged acts of harassment, the appellant retired in lieu of facing removal for cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also rejected the appellant's assertion that her decision to retire was involuntary because she was erroneously told that she could not continue her health insurance coverage if she were removed. The administrative judge found that the persuasiveness of the appellant's argument was "undercut by the seriousness of the charges against her as well as by the strength of the evidence developed by the agency in support of those charges." He also found that "the agency submitted affidavits from at least three employees in the agency's personnel office denying that the appellant ever was given the misleading information that she alleges."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In essence, the administrative judge adjudicated the merits of the appellant's appeal by weighing evidence, resolving conflicting assertions, and finding facts from which he concluded that she failed to prove that her retirement was involuntary. The administrative judge should not have made this determination until after granting the appellant a hearing on jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 893-95 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Waldau</span>, at 195.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Redmond v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-15-0578-I-1 (NP 1/19/2016), returned a case for hearing on an involuntary retirement claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness, she is entitled to a hearing at which she must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Parrott</span>, 519 F.3d at 1332; <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1344. To meet the nonfrivolous standard, an appellant need only plead allegations of fact that, if proven, could show jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">SanSoucie v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 149, &#x00B6; 16 (2011). Thus, to establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant need not allege facts that, if proven, definitely <span class="Italic">would</span> establish that the retirement was involuntary; she need only allege facts that if proven <span class="Italic">could</span> establish such a claim. <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 139, 142 (2002). In assessing whether an appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations entitling her to a hearing, an administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent the agency's evidence contradicts the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant's allegations below show that she raised a nonfrivolous allegation that her retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Carey v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 106, &#x00B6; 7 (2009) (explaining that the appellant's allegations that she was forced to retire because the agency refused to accommodate her disability by allowing her to telecommute were adequate to entitle her to a hearing); <span class="Italic">see also Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1324 (finding that the agency's failure to renovate the appellant's workspace to accommodate her medical condition may have forced her to accept a demotion). In support of her assertion that her retirement was the result of intolerable working conditions, the appellant alleged that the agency removed her from her position as Chief, removed her credentials and subjected her to supervision, failed to accommodate her asthma, monitored her movements, and did not give her a key to an office. The appellant also submitted the "re-issue" of the agency's final agency decision in her equal employment opportunity (EEO) discrimination complaint. In her EEO complaint, the appellant relied upon the same alleged agency actions against her as she asserts in this appeal, and she alleged that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her disabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, instead of providing the appellant an opportunity for a hearing, the administrative judge thoroughly set forth and assessed the adequacy of the conflicting agency documentary evidence. The administrative judge detailed the agency's evidence regarding the appellant's performance and behavioral issues, as well as the actions the agency took against her in response to her alleged misconduct. Then, based upon a review of the record evidence, the administrative judge determined that there was no evidence to support the appellant's claim of intolerable working conditions. Specifically, the administrative judge found that the record demonstrated that the appellant's supervisor had received reports about her misconduct and, after investigating those reports, gave the appellant additional supervision and reporting requirements to credentialing. The administrative judge further found that, while the evidence showed that the appellant was unhappy and frustrated with her working conditions, she failed to show that a reasonable person in her position would have believed that she had no other option but to retire. After weighing all of the evidence, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. However, the administrative judge's determination to dismiss the appeal without holding a hearing was error because an administrative judge may not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting assertions regarding disputed facts material to the question of jurisdiction without affording the appellant the opportunity for a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Carey</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 106, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329-30.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Irrespective of <span class="Italic">Bomer</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board occasionally evaluates evidence and determines the implications of that evidence as it decides whether a jurisdictional hearing was properly denied by an AJ. <span class="Italic">Roush v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 59 MSPR 113, 117-18 &#x00B6; 8 (1993), discounted the appellant's allegations she felt compelled to retire after she received an assignment "she thought she was being set up to fail":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her statement on jurisdiction, the appellant repeats assertions that she had made in pursuing her EEO complaint. Essentially, she felt compelled to retire after she was given an assignment which she thought she was being set up to fail. According to the appellant, she was not to receive sufficient support from both her subordinates and superiors, and was given an incorrect format to follow. She states that she was also concerned by the attitude of certain supervisors at a meeting she attended, and by other remarks supervisors had made. For example, one supervisor told her that she had problems with her former supervisors, and that he had heard that she was "out to get the office."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1981"></span>The appellant has not set forth a nonfrivolous assertion that her retirement was involuntary. As the administrative judge found, the appellant could have raised her concerns about the assignment with the appropriate officials. She could also have accepted and completed the assignment, but chose instead to retire. In fact, when the appellant announced her intention to retire, the Deputy Inspector General of the agency asked her not to retire, but the appellant remained firm in her decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that although the appellant contended during her EEO investigation that her supervisor told her that someone had told him that if the agency had known that working for him would have caused her to retire, the assignment would have been made sooner, she did not repeat or support her assertion in her submission on jurisdiction. Further, the EEO investigation established that one purpose of the assignment was to permit the appellant, who had unsuccessfully sought a promotion, to serve as Auditor in Charge of an audit, and thus demonstrate her capabilities. Moreover, even if the appellant's assertion were proven, it would establish that the agency had not been aware that the appellant would feel strongly enough about the assignment to retire, and thus would not support an argument that it gave her the assignment to coerce her into retiring.[3] <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 26 MSPR 244, 246 (1985) (setting forth criteria for analyzing whether an agency sought to transfer an employee in order to coerce the employee's retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Nor is it entirely clear that the appellant retired because of her strong feelings about the assignment. According to Deputy Inspector General Fleishmann, the appellant explained her decision to retire by stating that she was tired of working, disliked her long commute, wanted to spend more time pursuing other interests, and was at an appropriate age with sufficient length of government service to retire.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As with other constructive adverse action appeals, the best support for allegations will be through detailed sworn statements submitted to the Board in support of an appeal or in response to either an AJ 's show cause order or an agency motion to dismiss. The sworn statements should be specific and factual, supported, should they be available, by relevant documents attached as exhibits. The facts described in the statements should support a showing of involuntariness, as measured by the case law from the Board and the Federal Circuit.</p>
