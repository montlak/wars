<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-54"><span class="space">H.</span> DETERMINATION OF INTERNAL SECURITY</h3>
<p class="noindent">The connection between agency security practices and negotiable proposals was discussed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB</span>, 37 FLRA 197, 200 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1)...includes the right to determine policies and take actions which are part of its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel and physical property....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that a particular plan or policy falls within the scope of the right to determine internal security practices, an agency must show that there is a reasonable link between the plan or policy and the security of its operations. In determining the negotiability of a proposal that arguably interferes with an agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the Authority will not inquire into the extent of the measures employed to achieve the objective so long as they reasonably <span id="page_569"></span>relate to the purpose for which the particular security plan or practice is adopted.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1920 and DOD, AAFES, Ft. Hood Exch.</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 349 (1993) (Proposal 3, for relocation of work location within facility: "We will not examine the extent to which the practices adopted by management to achieve its security objectives actually facilitate the accomplishment of those objectives[;]...the Agency has demonstrated a reasonable connection between the location of the Refunds Section and the protection of the property in the main store."). The right to determine internal security practices is not expressly subject to "applicable law" constraints. <span class="Italic">AFGE Fed. Prison Council 33 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 51 FLRA 1112, 1116 n.2 (1996); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS</span>, 55 FLRA 228, 230-37 (1999) (rejecting agency's argument that external laws authorizing agencies to permit employees to carry weapons precluded negotiation, as matter relating to employment conditions, of proposal delineating weapons that employees could carry; holding specific proposals nonnegotiable as arrangements but permissively negotiable).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's inquiry is not factual, it is logical, as was explained in <span class="Italic">Int'l Bhd. Of Police Officers and Dept. of Army, Watervliet Arsenal</span>, 46 FLRA 333, 337-38 (1992), determining to be nonnegotiable a proposal that guard desk officers be permitted to watch television while on duty:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...To the extent the Union argues that the Agency has not demonstrated a link between its internal security practices and the prohibition on the use of a personal television because it has not offered factual proof of a lapse in security, we reject that argument. In establishing a link, the Authority requires an agency to show a reasonable connection between its goal of safeguarding personnel or property and its practice designed to implement that goal, rather than factual proof that the danger or risk has occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1030 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FDC Houston</span>, 57 FLRA 901, 903 (2002) (nonnegotiable: proposals involving design and use of perimeter guard shelters; agency "established a reasonable link between the patrol of its perimeter by guards and its goal of safeguarding its personnel, physical property, and operations against internal and external risks'); <span class="Italic">SSA Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 55 FLRA 498, 502 (1999) (on review of exceptions to arbitration award: "[w]hen there is a link or reasonable connection between an agency's goal of safeguarding personnel or property or of preventing disruption of agency operations and the disputed practice (involving a union survey of field offices), we will find that the disputed practice constitutes the exercise by management of its right under section 7106(a)(1) to determine its internal security practices").</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of the logical connection analysis is <span class="Italic">DOD, Ft. Bragg Dependents Sch. And Ft. Bragg Ass'n of Educators</span>, 49 FLRA 333, 343 (1994), determining to be nonnegotiable a section of Proposal 4, requiring 24-hour access to the union office:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Here, the Agency contends that it has a need to retain the ability to restrict access to its facilities by Union representatives based on concerns for security and personnel safety. Although the Agency provides no further elaboration on this claim, the relationship between the need of a military base to retain the ability to restrict access to its premises and internal security considerations is obvious.

And NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 56 FLRA 398, 403-04 (2000), provides further analysis of the degree of relatedness between an agency practice and internal security that is required before a matter becomes nonnegotiable. The agency's investigative unit decided to use videotapes to record employee interviews. FLRA concluded that the recording technique sufficiently advanced the quality of the investigative effort that the practice itself was nonnegotiable. The impact was negotiable. As to the negotiability of the practice itself:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question to be resolved is whether the Judge erred in concluding that the Respondent did not establish a reasonable connection between its decision to videotape record employee interviews and the objective of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has held that an agency's right to determine its internal security practices include the policing of its own employees. The right to determine its internal security practices also includes the right to determine the investigative techniques management will employ to attain its internal security objectives. In addition, subject to a legitimate link with internal security, techniques aimed at obtaining truthful and reliable information from interviewees constitute internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Customs, </span>55 FLRA at 47. Under long-standing precedent, where management shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its objective of safeguarding its personnel, property or operations and the investigative technique designed to implement that objective, a proposal that "conflicts with" the selected investigative technique directly interferes with management's right under section 7106(a)(1)<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent does not specifically define what is meant by "safeguarding" but it encompasses actions taken by an agency to prevent misconduct or threats to personnel, property or operations, including an agency's choice of the investigative techniques that it will use to obtain probative evidence regarding misconduct. For example, in <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 51 FLRA at 1116, the Authority found that the agency established, as an investigative technique, the requirement that investigators not ask certain interviewees to review and sign a certain form. The Authority stating that "there is a clear and logical connection between techniques designed to promote candid and truthful answers during investigations of employee wrongdoing and the [a]gency's objective to safeguard its personnel, property, or operations" found that the agency established a reasonable link between its practice and the objective of safeguarding its personnel, property or operations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span> <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Denver, Colorado, </span>52 FLRA 16, 35-37 (1996), the investigative technique of using a covert video camera to uncover misconduct was found to constitute an internal security practice. In <span class="Italic">GSA, </span>18 FLRA at 798, the Authority found that an agency's decision to use sworn (rather than unsworn statements) to ensure its obtaining truthful and reliable information in conducting investigations is an internal security practice under section 7106(a)(1); and also, found that an agency's use of polygraph tests constituted an internal security practice because it was an investigative technique used by the agency to conduct its investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now apply the above Authority law to this case.&#x2003;The Respondent argues that it established that its decision to videotape record employee interviews constitutes an internal security practice. Specifically, the Respondent argues that its practice of videotape recording employee interviews: (1) is an investigative technique employed by the Office of IA to record the physical demeanor of the interviewee--that is, it is aimed at obtaining truthful and reliable information from interviewees; (2) is analogous to polygraph examination in that both techniques permit the recordation of physical responses for later examination by investigators in their attempt to more accurately assess the truthfulness or reliability of the employee's response; (3) is connected to the Agency's objective of safeguarding personnel, property, or operations because it provides a visual record of the actual interview which can later serve as evidence should the integrity of the interview process be questioned; and (4) safeguards personnel, property, or operations in that the video camera stands in witness to potential physical altercations that may occur during the interview process and further has a calming effect on witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Respondent's first argument, the Judge acknowledged that "a video is the best evidence of an interview," which is "well supported by the widespread use of video depositions in civil jury trials." However, the Judge found that the Respondent did not establish that videotape recording an interviewee to capture the employee's demeanor had any reasonable relationship to any plan to secure or safeguard Respondent's personnel, physical property, or operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Judge, the record supports a conclusion that the Respondent established a reasonable link between its investigative technique--videotape recording an employee subject to an investigation by the Office of IA, to capture the demeanor of the employee interviewee--and its objective of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations. In this regard, the record shows that the Respondent, a law enforcement agency, Office of IA, is responsible for conducting investigative interviews concerning employee misconduct and that the "mission of the Office of Internal Affairs is to assist executive management and the Commissioner of Customs with preserving the overall integrity of the Customs Service." The record further shows that the subject of the New Orleans interview was being investigated because he failed to report certain arrests to the Office of IA as described by the Respondent's policies and procedures manual and that a reason for videotape recording the employee was "to determine [his] credibility," that is, to "detect whether the employee was lying or not by what was captured by his body language on the videotape."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also shows that an IA Agent from Texas, testified that his office "videotaped 20 to 25 percent of its interviews" because "it is the best evidence of an interview that you can have." In terms of videotaping verses audio, the Agent testified..."there's more to a conversation...than just the verbal content. There's body language...facial expressions, which you don't capture on audio recordings."'</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the evidence shows that in New Orleans and Texas, the videotape was used by the IA office as an investigative technique to obtain truthful and reliable information in the conduct of employee investigative interviews. This use of the videotape to discern truth via body language or the demeanor of the witness in an investigative interview is as legitimate as obtaining "truthful and reliable" information from a witness through a polygraph test. Moreover, even <span id="page_570"></span>the Judge recognized that the video is the best evidence of an interview. However, the Judge rejected this reason because videotape recording employee interviews "was not part of the Agency's plan or policy to videotape all interviews."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's rejection of the Respondent's argument on the basis that the Respondent did not videotape all interviews is erroneous because the discretion to determine under what circumstances certain security action is warranted is an integral part of an agency's plan to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2302 and U.S. Army Armor Center and Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Knox, Fort Knox, Kentucky, </span>19 FLRA 778, 782 (1985) <span class="Italic">(U.S. Army Armor Center) </span>(Authority found that the discretion to determine under what circumstances certain security action was warranted was an integral part of the agency, a military installation, plan to determine its internal security practices); <span class="Italic">GSA, </span>18 FLRA at 799 (the Authority found that management has the discretion to determine the practices (sworn rather than unsworn statements) it will use to ensure its obtaining of truthful and reliable information in conducting investigations); <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council and Department of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo,</span> <span class="Italic">California, </span>12 FLRA 361, 362 (1983) <span class="Italic">(Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy) </span>(a proposal that sought to require the agency to extend its security practice to all employees was found outside the duty to bargain because it conflicted with the agency's decision to limit the application of the security practice).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Assistant Commissioner of IA testified that the Office of IA does not videotape all interviews of employees, but rather interviews are videotaped at the "discretion of the investigator." The evidence shows, therefore, that the Agency decided not to videotape record all investigative interviews, but left the discretion to determine what interviews needed to be videotaped to the discretion of the investigator. We find that the videotaping of all internal affairs interviews need not be undertaken by the Respondent in order for such technique to be considered a part of its internal security plan. Rather, consistent with the Authority decisions cited above, predicated on an actual link to internal security, the Respondent has the right to determine under what circumstances internal affairs investigative interviews will be videotaped. Accordingly, the Judge erred by finding that videotape recording employee interviews was not part of the Agency's plan or policy because the Respondent did not videotape all interviews. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Army Armor</span> <span class="Italic">Center; Department of the Navy.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Respondent established a reasonable link between its objective of safeguarding its personnel, property or operations and its investigative technique of videotape recording employees subject to IA investigations. Accordingly, the practice constitutes an internal security practice under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) includes the right to determine policies and take actions that are part of its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel and physical property. Under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1482 and Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow</span>, 31 FLRA 916, 918 (1988), "[w]here a link has been established between an agency's action and its expressed security concerns, we will not review the merits of that action." On that basis a proposal was nonnegotiable that permitted continuation of employees' use of bicycles to commute through the facility. The agency argued the cyclists posed a hazard to themselves, others, and agency equipment. Internal security concerns have negated other proposals, e.g., those involving paycheck distribution, because the proposal (mandating quicker distribution of checks) could require the agency to forego auditing and other control measures necessary to safeguard its payroll system. <span class="Italic">NTEU Local R14-89 and Army Air Defense Artillery Ctr.</span>, 32 FLRA 392, 397-99 (1988). <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 59 FLRA 749, 753 (2004) (remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

<p class="noindent-1">Citing the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>[33], the Union asserts that the Agency has not established the requisite link between its alleged security objective and its no-barrier policy because the Agency permits barriers in certain circumstances. In this regard, the Union asserts that the Agency permits officers to work in non-kiosk inspection booths (the booths)--which "provide a barrier between the [o]fficers and the passengers"--despite the Agency's alleged concern that barriers prevent officers from quickly reacting to emergencies.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;61 FLRA 48 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the agency's uniform policy allowed officers to wear cargo shorts in some locations, but not others. The Authority found that the agency did not establish a link or reasonable connection between its uniform policy and its alleged security concerns because the agency "fail[ed] to articulate any security differences...that warrant[ed] a different uniform policy in [the different] locations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the agency in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Agency here identifies "security differences" that justify its different barrier policies. The Agency asserts that officers working at kiosk podiums perform a "different" security inspection than officers in the booths. In this regard, the Agency states that officers in the booths "have computers and computer terminals" that require them to input administrative information for the passenger. But, in the kiosk system, "the administrative burden is shifted to the traveler," allowing the "[o]fficer[s] to focus on law[-]enforcement functions." The Union does not dispute these differences, and, in fact, agreed in the MOU that the kiosk system was implemented to "<span class="Italic">increase</span> the amount of time an [o]fficer has to perform an enforcement examination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> is misplaced and that the Agency's no-barrier policy in the kiosk system is reasonably connected to its stated purpose of safeguarding passengers and officers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union claims that the Agency provided "no evidence" that Proposal 2's plexiglass barriers would inhibit officers from being able to quickly address emergencies, as noted above, we will not examine the extent to which the policy or practice adopted by the Agency to achieve its security objectives actually facilitates the accomplishment of those objectives.[45] Moreover, because Proposal 2 requires the Agency to install plexiglass barriers between officers working at kiosk podiums and the traveling public, it conflicts with the Agency's current no-barrier policy in the kiosk system. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 2 affects management's right to determine its internal-security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.[47]</p>

<p class="noindent">The proposal in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> was not a negotiable arrangement, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 69 FLRA 355, 358-59 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that, even if Proposal 2 affects management's right to determine its internal-security practices, the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. When determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of <span id="page_571"></span>a management right. If the proposal is an arrangement, the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights. The Authority makes this determination by weighing "the competing practical needs of employees and managers," in order to ascertain whether the benefits to employees flowing from the proposal outweigh the proposal's burdens on the exercise of the management right involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that Proposal 2 constitutes an arrangement, we find, for the following reasons, that it is not appropriate because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal-security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As described by the Union, Proposal 2 would benefit officers by providing "more separation between the [o]fficers and the passengers." The Union claims that the additional space would protect officers from "irate passenger[s]" and from "passenger[s] lunging at the officer[s]." The Union also argues that the additional space would protect officers "from airborne germs in the event the passenger sneezes, coughs, or is contagious." Further, according to the Union, the burden on the Agency is minimal because officers already have "the option to ask travelers to step back if there is an officer[-]safety concern." In this regard, the Union claims that Proposal 2 simply "memorialize[s]" the current practice "by using the barriers to create the space that [o]fficers can already request on a case-by-case basis."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the Agency asserts that officers must be able to quickly "step out from the podiums and to stop any threat that may arise from drugs or from weapons." The barriers, according to the Agency, would inhibit the officers' movement and detract from the officers' ability to quickly respond to an emergency beyond the podium. The Agency further states that the barriers "could lead to an [o]fficer being pinned" between the kiosk podium and the barrier during an emergency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we conclude that the burdens that Proposal 2 places on the Agency outweigh the limited benefits to the officers.[63] In this regard, Proposal 2 precludes the Agency from maintaining its current barrier-free kiosk system, which, according to the Agency, places officers in the "best [position to] respond to any security incidents that occur around the [kiosk] podium." Although the Union disputes the Agency's assertion that the barriers would impede the officer's ability to respond to an emergency, the Union does not explain how the addition of a "physical barrier" would <span class="Italic">not</span> obstruct an officer's movement. Moreover, to the extent that Proposal 2 simply "memorialize[s]" the officers' current ability to create space between themselves and the public in the event of a safety concern, the barriers provide no additional benefit to the officers. Accordingly, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to determine its internal-security practices and is not negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.[68]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[68]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Local 3937</span>, 66 FLRA at 400.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Agency also argues that Proposal 2 affects its right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. And the Union, in response, claims that Proposal 2 is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. However, because we have found that Proposal 2 excessively interferes with management's right to determine internal-security practices, Proposal 2 is outside the duty to bargain even if it is an appropriate arrangement for the exercise of management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work.[71] Consequently, it is unnecessary to resolve whether Proposal 2 affects management's right to determine methods and means, or whether it is an appropriate arrangement for the exercise of that right.[72]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency identifies its security objective as safeguarding officers, the general public, and the nation's airports from the risk of weapons and drugs. The Agency asserts that its "current...policy" requires officers in the kiosk system to stand. According to the Agency, standing officers are in an "engaged posture"; have unobstructed sightlines; and are able to "quickly...react" to emergency situations. As to proposal one, the Agency argues that permitting an officer to sit while performing his or her duties places the officer in a "defensive position"; slows reaction time; and impairs the officer's sightlines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing <span class="Italic">NTEU and U.S. DHS, Bureau of CBP</span> (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>),[38] the Union alleges that the Agency has not established a link between its security objectives and its policy.

<p class="noindent-2">[38]&#x2003;61 FLRA 48 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, the agency had a policy that allowed officers to wear cargo shorts in some locations, but not others.[41] The Authority found that the agency did not establish a link or reasonable connection between its policy and its alleged security objective because the agency "fail[ed] to articulate any security differences...that warrant[ed] a different uniform policy in [the different] locations."[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[42]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 51.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, unlike in <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, the Agency identifies relevant security determinations that justify a different policy. In particular, the Agency explains that an officer in the kiosk system "perform[s] a <span class="Italic">different</span> primary inspection [within] a <span class="Italic">different</span> construct."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the inspection, the Agency argues that an officer in a booth uses a computer monitor to input passengers' "administrative information," and, as a result, the officer "split[s] [his or her attention] between...data gathering and [passenger] assess[ment]." But, in the kiosk system, an officer's "administrative role is removed" because the passenger completes that portion of the inspection using the automated kiosks. This results in a "length[ier], more thorough[,] and safer enforcement inspection" in the kiosk system. The Union claims that a booth officer performs the "exact same [security] inspection" as a kiosk officer. However, in the MOU, the Union agreed that the kiosk system "allows the [officer] to focus more on the enforcement part of his [or] her duties" and "is designed to increase the amount of time [the o]fficer has to perform...enforcement examination[s]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the difference between "construct[s]," the Agency argues that the kiosk system, compared to the booth construct, does not provide the same "physical barriers between the officer and the [passenger]." The Union does not dispute this difference and, in fact, acknowledges that, in the kiosk system, an officer is exposed to a greater threat from attack because the podiums do not offer "proper separation of the officer and the passenger."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has sufficiently articulated security differences that warrant different policies with regard to booth officers and kiosk officers. Accordingly, we find that <span class="Italic">DHS</span> is distinguishable.[55] We also find, based on the above, that the Agency has demonstrated that its policy of requiring kiosk officers to stand is reasonably connected to its stated purpose of safeguarding passengers, officers, and airport property.[56]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[55]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See e.g., NTEU</span>, 69 FLRA at 357-58 (distinguishing <span class="Italic">DHS</span> where agency identified security differences justifying different security policies).</p>

(finding that a no-barrier policy was reasonably related to the objective of safeguarding officers and passengers, where the agency argued that the policy placed officers in the best position to quickly react to threats from weapons and drugs).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Union argues that the Agency has not demonstrated the requisite link because the Agency has not offered proof that standing officers are better suited to accomplish the Agency's security objectives, the Authority does not examine the extent to which a policy or practice adopted by an agency to achieve its security objectives actually facilitates the accomplishment of those objectives.[58]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Int'l Bhd</span>., 46 FLRA at 337-38 (agency was not required to prove that a proposal that conflicted with internal-security practice <span id="page_572"></span>would cause a "lapse in security" in order to demonstrate a link between its internal-security practices and its security objectives).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By permitting officers in the kiosk system to sit, the proposal conflicts with the Agency's policy requiring those officers to stand.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that, even if the proposal affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the proposal is negotiable as a procedure or an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3) of the Statute, respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">i.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appropriate Arrangement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.[62] If the proposal is an arrangement, the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights.[63] The Authority makes this determination by weighing "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" in order to ascertain whether the benefits to employees flowing from the proposal outweigh the proposal's burdens on the exercise of the management right involved.[64]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[62]&#x2003;E.g., <span class="Italic">Local 3937</span>, 66 FLRA at 400 (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the proposal constitutes an arrangement, we find, for the following reasons, that it is not appropriate because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine internal-security practices.[65]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[65]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA 112, 117 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local 1164</span>) (even assuming that the proposal constituted an arrangement, it was not an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interfered with the exercise of a management right (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 65 FLRA 836, 841 (2011))).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As described by the Union, the Agency's current policy results in officers standing for prolonged periods. The Union alleges that the proposal--by permitting officers to sit--will: alleviate and prevent the multitude of physical and mental conditions that prolonged standing causes; reduce workers' compensation claims and sick-leave requests; and improve employee morale. The Agency disputes that the proposal will benefit the officers and claims, without contradiction, that there have been no reported injuries due to standing in the kiosk system. The Agency also asserts that it has already taken steps to mitigate "any [adverse] effects of standing." Specifically, the Agency has provided officers with "cushioned foot support," thus limiting the alleged benefit of the Union's proposal.[74]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[74]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NATCA</span>, 66 FLRA 658, 661 (2012) (Member DuBester dissenting in part) (finding that the benefit of a proposal was limited because the agency had taken steps to mitigate the adverse effect of the agency's exercise of a management right (citing <span class="Italic">Local 3937</span>, 66 FLRA at 397)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the burden on management's rights, the proposal would countermand the Agency's current internal-security practice and require the Agency to exercise its internal-security right in a different manner. A proposal such as this--which negates the Agency's internal-security determination entirely--is not an "appropriate" way to ameliorate a right's adverse effects within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).[76]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[76]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA at 117; <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU, Local R7-51</span>, 30 FLRA 415, 419 (1987) (a proposal "precluding [an] [a]gency from implementing its chosen internal[-]security practice...constitutes a significant intrusion into the exercise of management's rights").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the forgoing, we find that the proposal significantly burdens the Agency's right to determine internal&#8209;security practices and this burden outweighs any benefits that the proposal would afford to the officers. Consequently, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to determine internal-security practices and is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">ii.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedure</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposal is a negotiable procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. In the Union's view, the proposal neither prohibits nor interferes with the Agency's exercise of its management rights. In contrast, the Agency argues that the "proposal directly interferes with [the Agency's] [k]iosk [system]...by removing the [o]fficer from the safest enforcement position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union cites no authority to support its contention that the proposal is negotiable as a procedure.[80] Moreover, as described above, the proposal determines, in substance, how the Agency will safeguard its personnel, physical property, and operations in the kiosk system.[81] And because the proposal prohibits the Agency from maintaining its chosen internal-security practice of having officers stand, the proposal does not resemble proposals or provisions that the Authority has held to be procedures under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2).[82] Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not concern the procedures that the Agency will observe in exercising its right to determine internal-security practices, as set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[80]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 723</span>, 66 FLRA 639, 644 (rejecting union's assertion that proposals were procedures under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) because the union failed to present "authority to support that claim").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[81]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Customs Serv. Region I</span> (<span class="Italic">Boston, Mass</span>.), 15 FLRA 309, 311 (1984) (proposal requiring the agency to allow customs officers to sit on stools while performing airport-passenger security inspections--in direct contravention of agency decision to require inspectors to stand--not negotiable).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[82]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Compare AFGE, Local 2058</span>, 68 FLRA 676, 679 (2015) (proposal that prohibited an agency from implementing its chosen internal-security practice of using security cameras to monitor employee duty stations was not a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)) and Local 2143, 48 FLRA at 45 (where rotational-shift policy was an internal-security practice, proposal requiring agency, in some circumstances, to grant shift-change requests even when inconsistent with that policy, not a procedure), <span class="Italic">with AFGE, Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA 209, 220 (2005) (noting that proposals requiring advance notice of an agency action, or of a specific event, are negotiable as procedures (citation omitted)) and <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapters 243 &#x0026; 245</span>, 45 FLRA 270, 280 (1992) (drug-testing proposal imposing procedural requirements--but retaining agency's ability to use its internal-security practice of random drug testing--constituted procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as noted above, the Agency also argues that the proposal affects its right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. The Union contests this claim, and argues that the proposal is negotiable as either an appropriate arrangement or a procedure. Because we have found that the proposal affects management's right to determine internal-security practices and does not fall within an exception under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or (3) of the Statute, the proposal is outside the duty to bargain even if it is an appropriate arrangement or a procedure for another management right.[86] Consequently, it is unnecessary to resolve whether the proposal affects management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), or whether it is an appropriate arrangement or a procedure for the exercise of that right.[87]</p>

<p class="noindent">The link between a proposal, or the enforcement of a contract provision in arbitration, and national security should be more than tangential, as FLRA explained in response to a challenge to an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 61 FLRA 72, 76 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency management's right to determine its internal security policies and practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are a part of an agency's plan to secure and safeguard its personnel, property, and operations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Oakdale, La.</span>, 59 FLRA 277, 279 (2003). Where an agency establishes a link or reasonable connection between the agency's goal of safeguarding personnel or property, or preventing disruption of agency operations, and the disputed practice, the Authority will find that the practice constitutes the agency's exercise of its right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator in this case determined that CBP's practice of providing 150 rounds of ammunition to employees preparing for firearms qualification did not implicate management's right to determine its internal security practices. That is, the Arbitrator found that there is no connection between CBP's decision to provide a particular amount of ammunition to employees to be used in practicing for firearms qualification and CBP's internal security concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CBP has failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in making this finding. CBP's arguments support the conclusion that ammunition for its firearms is essential to the use of those firearms in securing its personnel, property, and operations. CBP fails to establish, however, that the amount of ammunition available to employees to practice for firearms qualification has any such internal security ramifications. In the absence of the requisite link to internal security concerns, the award enforcing Section C does not affect management's <span id="page_573"></span>right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Region V</span>, 45 FLRA 737, 752-53 (1992). Because the award does not affect management's right to determine its internal security practices, it is unnecessary to address the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Distrib. Ctr., Def. Distrib. Depot Red River, Texarkana, Tex</span>., 56 FLRA 690, 694 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's analysis of internal security issues generally favors agencies, but on occasion FLRA concludes that the record supplied to it does not support the conclusion that a proposal adversely impacts the agency's right to determine its security practices. That occurred in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-007.html">61 FLRA 48</a>, 50-51 (2005), involving a proposal that officers be permitted to wear cargo shorts:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are a part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal or external risks. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 348 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Local 1920</span>). Where the agency shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its objectives of securing or safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the policy or practice designed to implement that objective, a proposal that conflicts with the policy or practice affects management's right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1186 (1999). Upon finding such a link, the Authority "will not examine the extent to which the practices adopted by management to achieve its security objectives actually facilitate the accomplishment of those objectives." <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Locals 2910 &#x0026; 2477</span>, 49 FLRA 834, 839 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has failed to demonstrate the requisite link or reasonable connection between its policy of limiting the wearing of cargo shorts to posts on the Southwest border and in South Florida and Puerto Rico and its security concerns.&#x2003;In asserting that the policy requiring uniformed officers to wear trousers in all but a limited number of Class 3 work environments serves its anti-terrorism and law enforcement objectives, the Agency fails to articulate any security differences in the locations excepted from that policy that warrant a different uniform policy in those locations. In this regard, uniformed officers interact with a variety of individuals at locations where shorts are currently allowed. While the traveling public apparently is not a group present at these locations, the Agency does not explain or identify how the absence of the traveling public at these locations presents different security considerations in terms of the uniforms to be worn.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the same reasons, the Agency's claim that its policy is necessary in order to identify Agency personnel in the work environment is unavailing. In this regard, the Authority has recognized that the requirement of a uniform for purposes of identifying agency personnel may be an internal security matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 217</span>, 21 FLRA 62, 65-66 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Local 217</span>). However, the Agency fails to explain why uniformed personnel at the locations excepted from the policy are sufficiently identifiable for security purposes while wearing shorts, but such personnel in every other Class 3 work environment would not be. Moreover, we note that the Agency has itself identified a standard type of cargo shorts that can be worn as a part of the uniform for Class 3 environments, a matter fully consistent with the Agency's desire to make personnel sufficiently identifiable for security purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as the Union points out, other parts of the required uniform contain additional means of identification, for example, shirts and/or jackets with badges, nameplates, and shoulder emblems. It is undisputed that, under the proposal, uniformed personnel covered by the proposal would be wearing the cargo shorts specified in the National Uniform Program. Because the proposal would be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the current uniform policy it is consistent with the Agency's need for those personnel to be readily identifiable as Agency law enforcement personnel for security purposes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1625</span>, 25 FLRA 1028, 1031 (1987) (proposal regarding uniform that is consistent with purpose of identification does not affect management's right to determine internal security). Moreover, the Agency has provided no explanation of the security considerations underlying its proposed change in its uniform policy regarding cargo shorts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency also fails to provide any substantiation for its safety-related arguments against the wearing of cargo shorts. Consequently, the Agency has not demonstrated that its policy is linked to protecting the physical well-being of those personnel. In this regard, as the Union points out, the Agency has provided no evidence as to on-the-job injuries related to uniform apparel in either those locations where cargo shorts are allowed or those where shorts are prohibited. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Chicago Region, Cleveland Ohio District Office, University Circle Branch</span>, 56 FLRA 1084, 1088-89 (2001) (agency must support its claim that a given action constitutes the exercise of a right); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 56 FLRA 398, 403-04 (2000) (agency burden with respect to demonstrating that the subject matter of a proposal concerns its internal security practices).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that there is a link or reasonable connection between its policy limiting the wearing of cargo shorts in a Class 3 work environment and its internal security concerns. Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not affect management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA may decline to approve the negotiability of a proposal requiring disclosure of information relating to security issues, but in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 60 FLRA 367, 381-82 (2004), involving a proposal concerning investigations involving the ability of employees to carry firearms in the course of the work, the agency was required to explain how a security practice is affected by the proposal for the agency's negotiability objection to be sustained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's right to determine its internal security practices "includes management action to prevent improper or unauthorized disclosure of privileged or confidential information[.]" <span class="Italic">Local 2050</span>, 36 FLRA at 639. Proposals or provisions that require agencies to<span class="Italic"> </span>disclose confidential or privileged information concerning an investigation affect management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA at 1186-87 (Member Wasserman dissenting in part) (provision involved audiotapes and videotapes of interviews with witnesses, the disclosure of which could have compromised agency's investigation); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1738</span>, 27 FLRA 52, 54-56 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Local 1738</span>) (Authority rejected union's claim that proposal requiring agency to notify union immediately of results of investigations involving unit employees "was not intended to...preclude the disclosure of confidential information[&#8197;]"); <span class="Italic">Local 1300</span>, 18 FLRA at 796-97, (agency argued that proposal involved, and Authority applied case law regarding, "privileged and confidential information"); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Labor Relations Bd. Union</span>, 5 FLRA 696, 697-98 (1981) (<span class="Italic">NLRBU</span>) (proposal granting union and employees right to copy investigative files). By contrast, where an<span class="Italic"> </span>agency does not demonstrate that the information addressed by a union proposal is privileged or confidential, or that release of the information otherwise relates to the determination of the agency's internal security practices, the proposal does not affect management's right to determine internal security practices.[n.11] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2050</span>, 36 FLRA at 639-40; <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 153</span>, 21 FLRA 841, 847 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Chapter 153</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Local 1300</span>, where the agency argued that the proposal involved, and the Authority applied case law regarding, privileged and confidential information, the Authority also stated that "it is irrelevant what information concerning the investigation management is required to disclose....&#8197;[T]he right to determine the nature and extent of the information concerning an investigation which it will disclose, and to whom it will disclose that information, is reserved to management under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Local 1300</span>, 18 FLRA at 796-97. Although this statement did not specifically identify that the information at issue was confidential or privileged, it is clear from the decision as a whole that <span class="Italic">Local 1300 </span>was based on the confidential or privileged nature of the information that would be disclosed. In particular, in <span class="Italic">Local 1300</span>, the Authority stated that it "has held that rules and policies pertaining to the disclosure of privileged and confidential information constitute internal security practices within the discretion of management to determine under section 7106(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. At 796.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As such, <span class="Italic">Local 1300</span> is consistent with the standard set forth elsewhere in the Authority decisions cited above: a proposal that requires an agency to disclose confidential or privileged information concerning an investigation affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). If an agency does not demonstrate that the information addressed by a union proposal is privileged or confidential, or that release of the information otherwise relates to the determination of the agency's internal security practices, the proposal does not affect management's right to determine internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 14(f) would require the Agency to provide an employee with a monthly, written report informing the employee of the status of an internal firearms authority investigation, including the expected time frame for completion of the investigation. The Agency does not claim that disclosing information concerning either the status or the expected time frame of an investigation is privileged and confidential, nor does the Agency dispute the Union's claim that the proposal would not require disclosure of information that would compromise the Agency's investigation. Additionally, the Agency does not explain how declining to provide the report is linked or reasonably connected to the Agency's objective of securing and safeguarding Agency personnel, property or operations. Consequently, there is no basis on which to conclude that the Agency could be required to disclose privileged or confidential information. Accordingly, the Agency has not demonstrated that the second sentence of Proposal 14(f) affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, and we conclude that the second sentence of Proposal 14(f) is within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_574"></span>As will be seen in <a href="0100-2023-14-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>, the right of management to establish internal security as a management right does not preclude negotiations over arrangements bargaining, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman v. FLRA</span>, 737 F.3d 779, 783-84 (D.C. Cir. 2013):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">NTEU 2008</span>), 550 F.3d 1148, 384 U.S. App. D.C. 42 (D.C. Cir. 2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135, requires federal agencies to bargain with public employee unions over employment conditions, but renders certain management rights nonnegotiable, including an agency's right to determine its "internal security practices," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). When a union submits a proposal that would affect an agency's internal security practices, the agency can invoke this provision to relieve it of the obligation to negotiate over the proposal. To find that a proposal would affect the agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the Federal Labor Relations Authority must determine that the agency's policy is reasonably linked to the security of its operations, and that the union's proposal deviates from or modifies the policy. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>), 404 F.3d 454, 456-57, 365 U.S. App. D.C. 296 (D.C. Cir. 2005). An agency may nevertheless be required to negotiate over a proposal which would affect its right to determine its internal security practices if the union can establish that the proposal represents an "appropriate arrangement[&#8197;] for employees adversely affected" by the agency's exercise of that right. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In assessing whether a proposal that would affect an agency's right to determine its internal security practices is nonetheless negotiable as an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the "<span class="Italic">KANG</span> test." <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>), 437 F.3d 1248, 1252-53, 369 U.S. App. D.C. 396 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R14-87</span> (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>), 21 F.L.R.A. 24 (1986)). Under this test, the Authority requires the union to establish that the proposal is in fact intended as an arrangement to benefit employees. If the union does so, then the Authority balances the "'practical needs of employees and managers'" to see if the proposal "'excessively interferes'" with management rights. <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 437 F.3d at 1253 (quoting <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 31-32).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Therefore, in order to conclude that an agency has no obligation to negotiate over a proposal, the Authority must determine, first, that the proposal would affect the agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, second, that the proposal does not qualify as an appropriate arrangement. While the Authority may make the first determination without requiring the agency to produce evidence if the connection is obvious, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Def. Fort Bragg Dependents Sch</span>., 49 F.L.R.A. 333, 343 (1994), its second determination must be supported by record evidence, e.g., <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 458.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We have neither the expertise nor the authority to address how well a proposed agency or union action will--or will not--accomplish the proposed purpose of an agency's internal security measure. That difficulty becomes even more of a concern when parties attempt to negotiate the content of dress and personal appearance standards. However, once an agency establishes the requisite connection between its internal security practices and the action(s) it proposes to take, any actions that have the effect of negating an agency's determination become outside the duty to bargain. That is not to say that agencies have a "free pass" on bargaining over its internal security procedures. As was done in <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>61 FLRA 48 (2005) (Member Armendariz dissenting), the Authority has the right to question whether a practice reflects the exercise of an agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Once that connection is found, though, the Authority is not in a position to judge whether male employees' hair should be permitted to be off the ear or allowed to extend one-half inch below the top of the ear, for example. For better or worse, that determination is left to the agency involved.</p>
