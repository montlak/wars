<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-179"><span class="space">1.</span> Threat; Inappropriate Conduct</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board and its reviewing court repeatedly conclude that removal is a reasonable penalty for threatening coworkers and supervisors with bodily harm, even when mitigating factors exist. "A federal agency, like any other employer, cannot be expected to tolerate threats directed at supervisory personnel." <span class="Italic">Chatman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 582, 588, 589 (1997). A threat affects the agency obligation to maintain a safe workplace for its employees, and it affects the efficiency of the service. It is worse when done in view of other employees. Failure to impose a substantial penalty for a public threat has negative repercussions on the efficiency of agency operations. The Board sustained removal of an employee who made a threat to an assistant supervisor with a lead pipe. The appellant had a record that included use of obscene and threatening language to supervisors and a two-day suspension for AWOL, balanced against 13 years of satisfactory service. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 99, 103, 7 MSPB 28 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chatman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 582, 589 (1997) (removal for threatening coworkers and supervisors with bodily harm, even where there were mitigating factors); <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432, 447 (1995) ("Needless to say, threatening a Government supervisor impairs the efficiency of the service."); <span class="Italic">Poarch v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 34, 35 (1984) (removal of warehouse worker based on charges of threatening to inflict bodily injury on another and disrespectful conduct--serious offenses with a direct effect on service efficiency); <span class="Italic">Blow v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 102, 106 (1982) (removal for threatening a coworker with a pipe and two threats of injury to a supervisor). Behavior that does not constitute a threat but that creates the potential for violence may influence the determination of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Holliman v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 372, 374 (1997), credited a psychologist, retained by the agency, who testified that the appellant's confrontational management style created a potential for violence at the facility where the appellant worked. That testimony supported the appellant's severe demotion and geographical reassignment. Government property should also be treated with respect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Simmons v. IRS</span>, 10 MSPR 133, 138 (1982) ("[T]hreatening to destroy government <span id="Page_2680"></span>property is a serious offense[.] "). A supervisor's failure properly to deal with a threat may support discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McComber v. USPS</span>, DA-0752-13-0233-I-1 (NP 7/21/2014) ("We find that the record supports the administrative judge's findings that the appellant did not fulfill his responsibility as Postmaster to ensure that timely and appropriate action was taken to address the threat, and that he therefore failed to ensure that disciplinary action was taken to protect the physical well-being of the facility's employees.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a threat case, the AJ must make any credibility determinations necessary to determine whether an appellant made the statements attributed to him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 64 MSPR 107, 112 (1994), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432 (1995) (extensive review of credibility and factual findings). "An appellant...cannot be held responsible for what others claim he said, absent credible evidence that he, in fact, said it." <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. Dept. of Army</span>, 87 MSPR 579, 589 &#x00B6; 34 (2001). Next is the problem of what was conveyed by the statements made by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Shakespeare said: "When Fortune means to men most good, She looks upon them with a threatening eye." When is a threat not a threat? First, one must determine the actual words employed: "[A] threat...is a legal determination that cannot be made without first knowing the actual words the appellant used." <span class="Italic">Mancini v. VA</span>. If an employee is charged with assault, it is sufficient to show that there was an apparent threat of physical harm and attendant apprehension. <span class="Italic">Sierra v. Dept. of Army</span>, 5 MSPR 523, 525, 5 MSPB 514 (1981) (charge of bringing a pistol, in fact a fake gun, onto the premises; the Board looked to the essence of the charge rather than the reference to a pistol and noted that "the two military policemen threatened by appellant believed the gun to be real at the time they were threatened"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McIntyre v.

<p class="Body-Text">For adverse action to be sustained based on a threat, there should be an apparent threat of physical harm and a reasonable attendant apprehension on the receiving end of the threat. A threat stemming from a poor supervisory relationship, that "'[a]t some time in the future, at a time that I will decide, you and I are going to have a bad confrontation,'" warranted a 30-day suspension, mitigated from a removal in <span class="Italic">Williams v. VA</span>, 10 MSPR 402, 404 (1982) (coupled with a suggestion to the agency to reassign the appellant). A reviewing court was not so accepting about the nature of the threat, reversing the Board's determination that a threat was made, <span class="Italic">Williams v. VA</span>, 701 F.2d 764, 765-66 (8th Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prove actionable misconduct, an agency must show an apparent threat and an attendant apprehension....&#8197;Thus, whether a statement made by one person to another is a threat depends partly on the intent of the person making the statement and partly on the perception of the person to whom the statement is made....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official concluded that Williams did not actually intend to threaten his supervisor, but that his supervisor reasonably construed what he said as being a threat. No dispute exists that Williams stated that he and his supervisor were "going to have a bad confrontation." However, when Williams repeated what he said in the presence of another employee, he stated "[t]hat wasn't a threat, that's a fact." Thus, Williams himself stated that he did not intend for the words "bad confrontation" to be taken as a threat. Moreover, it is important to understand the context in which Williams made the statement in question. Williams' discussion with his supervisor was only the latest of many such discussions about his performance. Williams had become tense, hostile, and irritated. Under such circumstances, a strong verbal, emotional response, does not, without more, indicate an intention to act with violence. In addition, the record lacks any evidence that Williams has ever raised his hand as if to strike his supervisor or made any other threatening motion to her.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency proposal notices at times obscurely characterize threatening conduct. Instead of labeling the conduct a threat, it is characterized as some other type of misconduct or insubordination. If the record shows, however, that the agency was actually charging that a threat was made and that the threat was the basis for the adverse action, the AJ should analyze the conduct under the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> standards, discussed below. <span class="Italic">Huisman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 378, 379 (1987) (remanding for determination of whether a threat was established by a statement to a supervisor referencing appellant's "dreams in which he saw himself breaking his hand on his supervisor's face and 'killing' him"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">O'Quinn v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 166, 169-70 (1995) ("[T]hat the appellant was arrested and pled guilty to a charge of battery is not a separate element of the 'threatening' charge but merely an explanation of what transpired after the alleged threat was made."); <span class="Italic">Carson v. VA</span>, 33 MSPR 666, 669-70 &#x0026; n.1 (1987) (loud and insolent language was a basis for discipline even if the language did not constitute a threat).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although intent may be a component of a threat charge, an agency may recharacterize the conduct as something else, avoid proving intent and instead rely on the spoken words and listeners' reactions, <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 177, 182-83 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant apparently asserts that the administrative judge erred by failing to consider whether he intended to make a threatening statement under <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The agency is free to take an adverse action against an employee for such cause as promotes the efficiency of the service. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a). Thus, so long as the agency proves its charge of making statements that caused anxiety and disruption in the workplace, and further proves that discipline promotes the efficiency of the service and that the penalty of removal is reasonable, its charge may be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Hanner v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 113, 118-19 (1992) (charge of creating a disturbance outside the appellant's work area); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 333, 338 (1984) (charge of disrespectful conduct towards the appellant's co-workers). In other words, because intent is not an element of the charge, the appellant's intent is irrelevant to a determination as to whether he engaged in the charged misconduct, although it may be a factor to consider in determining whether the agency's penalty selection is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Brough v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 119 MSPR 118, 126 n.2, 2013 MSPB 2 (2013) ("Because the agency charged the appellant with inappropriate conduct, rather than with making a threat, the agency was not required to prove that the appellant intentionally made a threat under the test set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1002-03 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and may instead consider the threatening nature of the appellant's comments in determining the penalty. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gray v. Government Printing Office</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 11 (2009); <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 177, 182-83 (1995).").

<p class="Body-Text">The Board links the concept of an actionable threat to violence. In <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span>, 30 MSPR 652, 657 (1986), the appellant, a chief deputy U.S. Marshal, was accused of threatening subordinates at a staff meeting. The charge was that the appellant "threatened employees with firings within three days and stated that he was 'going to put pressure on the supervisors to come down on' the deputies." Those statements, if proved, would not support a charge of making threats because the "agency did not allege that any of appellant's statements suggested harm to his subordinates." Threats may occur in other contexts, and the legal analysis may differ. An IRS employee who threatens someone with a tax audit for the purpose of personal gain or benefit is subject to mandatory discharge under the Internal Revenue Service Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Title I, &#x00A7; 1203. The <span class="Italic">Metz</span> criteria, involving threats of physical harm, are inapplicable to a threat to audit a taxpayer. The threat itself, without regard to the impact of the threat, appears sufficient to justify the mandatory termination of the IRS employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">James v. Tablerion</span>, 363 F.3d 1352, 1355-61 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board distinguished the intent to make a threat and the intent to carry out a threat. Proof of the latter is not essential to proof of the former, <span class="Italic">Greenough v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 648, 652 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In declining to apply <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the administrative judge found that the agency did not charge the appellant with making a threat because "the agency did not find that the appellant intended to carry out his words." Whether an employee intends to carry out a threat, however, is irrelevant to whether an employee intends to make a threat. <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 34 MSPR 534, 538 (1987). Thus, the administrative judge erred in basing her characterization of the agency's charge on any agency finding concerning the appellant's intent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Intent is still of importance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Powell v. DOJ</span>, 73 MSPR 29, 40 (1997) ("Moreover, the report of the appellant's conversation with the union representative, Ms. Mathis, wherein the appellant stated that he had said something 'stupid' to Ms. Kocher, indicates the appellant's lack of intent to make a genuine threat. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span id="Page_2681"></span><span class="Italic">Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1002."); <span class="Italic">cf. Jackson-Fisher v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-15-0492-I-1 (NP 9/13/2022) ("when the statement at issue is made intentionally and maliciously and conveys a threatening action, the Board will find that the intent element is proven. <span class="Italic">Rose v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 24 (2007).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant attempts to deflect an adverse action based on threats with medical evidence supporting his fitness for duty, the medical opinion relied on should demonstrate an awareness of the appellant's conduct and provide clinical or medical bases for the conclusion that the appellant could "return to the same environment that precipitated such misconduct." <span class="Italic">Hutson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 432, 448 n.8 (1995).
