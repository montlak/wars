<p class="Body-Text">"The agency bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the test on which it relied to remove the appellant was valid." <span class="Italic">Boykin v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 56, 58 (1991) (involving drug testing). Under <span class="Italic">Holton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 123 MSPR 688, 694 &#x00B6; 11, 2016 MSPB 39 (2016) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Holton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 884 F.3d 1142 (Fed. Cir. 2018)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency relies on a positive drug test to take an adverse action against an employee, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the test was valid. <span class="Italic">E.g., Forte v. Department of the Navy</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 8 (2016). To meet its burden, the agency must establish that the urine sample that tested positive was the appellant's by showing that the chain of custody of the sample was maintained and verifiable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An alleged violation of the agency's drug-testing procedures is reviewed under the harmful error standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Under this standard, reversal is only warranted if the appellant proves that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency must establish a chain of custody for the drug sample. If the chain of custody is not satisfactorily established, the agency case may be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 8 F.3d 798 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (reversing, due to problems relating to proof of the chain of custody, an arbitration award sustaining a removal for the alteration of a drug sample during random drug testing); <span class="Italic">Banks v. FAA</span>, 14 MSPR 283, 285 (1982) (as a result of a court order, the Board reconsidered and set aside a removal based on positive drug tests when the lab disposed of urine samples, making them unavailable for independent testing and inspection by appellants upon the AJ's order; the court ruled that the necessity for the appellants to prepare a credible defense required that the results of the lab tests be suppressed, with the result that the removals could not be sustained without other evidence to support the adverse actions). [<span class="Italic">Refer</span> earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-11-034.html#sec4-35">Physical Evidence</a>"; to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-283.html#sec8-281">Drug and Alcohol Offenses</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency relies on drug testing results to support an adverse action, an error in the (DHHS) procedure governing those tests will be analyzed under the harmful error rule. For the error to be of significance, it must adversely affect the substance of the medical evaluation resulting from the test. The AJ must assess the medical evidence to determine the effect of any error in the testing procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 47 MSPR 550, 556-57 (1991). [Constitutional objections to drug testing are considered later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-11-152.html#sec4-153">Drug Testing</a>"; refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-154.html#sec8-153">Refusal to Submit to Search or Drug Test</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-15-283.html#sec8-281">Drug and Alcohol Offenses</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A harmful error analysis was provided in <span class="Italic">Storm v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 14, 22-24 (1994), based on the appellant's objection to the agency's failure to timely notify him of drug test results so that he could, in turn, secure an independent examination of those results and persuade management to take no action against him:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further claims that, because the DHHS "Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs" required that urinalysis results be reported within 5 days, the agency committed harmful error by informing him of the result 23 days after he took the test. The appellant asserts that, if the positive result had been reported within 5 days of the test as required, he could have and would have taken a private drug test shortly thereafter that would have been negative and more "scientifically significant." He further asserts that the administrative judge mischaracterized the deciding official's testimony when he found that the deciding official testified that "had the appellant taken a more timely drug test that proved negative, he would have considered it, but, because of the proven 'track record' of [the testing laboratory that examined the appellant's urine sample], his decision would likely have been the same."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an agency's harmful error under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed, and that an agency's procedural error is harmful only if the appellant shows that the error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681, 685 (1991); <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 47 MSPR 550, 555 (1991) (the Board applied the harmful error analysis to DHHS guidelines).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the administrative judge's recitation of the deciding official's testimony does not comport with the hearing transcript in this appeal. As the appellant points out, the deciding official testified that, if the appellant took a private drug test on the same day as the agency's test and the private test came up negative, that result "would have been a consideration," but he did not know if he would have reached a different conclusion on the proposed suspension. Nevertheless, <span id="Page_1498"></span>we find that the appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that the delay in reporting his test results likely caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of its error<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]; <span class="Italic">Vincent</span>, 47 MSPR at 556-58.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we do not discount the possibility that an agency's procedural error may constitute harmful error when it effectively destroys, or precludes an appellant from acquiring, the only available evidence by which he can show that the agency likely would have reached a different conclusion in the absence of its error, <span class="Italic">cf. Banks v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 687 F.2d 92, 96 (5th Cir. 1982) (a testing laboratory's disposal of urine samples required the suppression of the positive results of its tests in the appellants' removal appeals because the samples were not available to the appellants for their independent testing and inspection), we find that the agency did not commit such procedural error here. The agency afforded the appellant an opportunity to have his original urine sample subjected to a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test to establish whether it was, in fact, his sample, but the appellant placed conditions upon the proposed DNA testing that the agency found unacceptable. The deciding official testified that, if the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology had performed a DNA test on the appellant's urine sample and the results of that test had indicated that the sample was not the appellant's, he would not have taken disciplinary action against the appellant. Moreover, the appellant's urine sample was available for his independent testing and inspection, and the testing laboratory, in response to a request by the agency, retested his sample in January 1993 and confirmed its original positive test result. We therefore find that the appellant has not shown that any delay by the agency in reporting the results of the appellant's drug test constitutes harmful error under the circumstances of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A deficient advance notice or an allegedly inadequate preliminary inquiry did not invalidate an adverse action based on a drug test, <span class="Italic">Holton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 123 MSPR 688, 696 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18, 2016 MSPB 39 (2016) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Holton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 884 F.3d 1142 (Fed. Cir. 2018), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the appellant argues that the agency failed to provide advance written notice of the test. The agency's drug-testing program provides that "management officials will notify the employee of the test and issue...specific written notice that the employee is being tested because of the accident or unsafe practice." The agency provided this notice 2 days after the test. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant did not prove that this notice deficiency changed the results of his drug test. <span class="Italic">See Forte</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19 (finding that the appellant failed to prove that the agency likely would have reached a different conclusion in the absence of a urine specimen collector's alleged error of not having him initial his vial seals).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues for the first time on review that the agency did not compile the written documents that are required under the agency's drug-testing program. The appellant does not allege that this argument is based on new and material evidence, and thus we need not address it. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (finding that the Board will generally not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence). Regardless, we find that any failure by the agency to "gather and document all information, facts, [and] circumstances" prior to testing, as required by its drug-testing program, was harmless. Before ordering testing, the Acting Director of Lifting and Handling examined the scene of the accident, spoke with the crane team, and conducted a preliminary assessment of the cost of the damage. The appellant has not proven that collecting documents would have caused the agency to forgo his testing, and thus he has not shown harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, <span class="Italic">Holton</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Holton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 884 F.3d 1142, 1149-50 (Fed. Cir. 2018), considering advance notice of a drug test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holton argues that he did not receive adequate written notice of the drug test. The Fourth Amendment imposes no such requirement. Other circuits have found it reasonable to subject employees to drug testing without formal notice. In <span class="Italic">Carroll v. City of Westminster</span>, the court held that "knowledge that [an employee] is subject to random drug tests is of no small importance. Although 'the precise time of the test will be unknown, the fact that [employees] are subject to this search procedure will not be a surprise,' and thus '[T]he privacy intrusion consequently is less severe.'" 233 F.3d 208, 211 (4th Cir. 2000) (second and third alterations in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Rutherford v. City of Albuquerque</span>, 77 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir. 1996)); <span class="Italic">cf. Nat'l Treasury</span>, 489 U.S. at 667-77, 676 n.4 (finding that random drug tests are permitted for certain employees, provided that employees have general notice that they are subject to the testing requirement). Mr. Holton does not contend that he was unaware of the drug test policy and prohibitions of the Naval Yard. The Navy Shipyard Portsmouth Instruction 12792.2B, issued on November 8, 2010, advised all employees on the policies and procedures related to drug testing at the Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the Fourth Amendment does not require written notice in advance, Mr. Holton points out that the applicable drug test instruction requires that the Navy "will notify the employee of the test and issue the specific written notice that the employee is being tested because of the accident or unsafe practice." Although Mr. Holton received oral notice of the drug test, he did not receive written notice of testing until March 13, 2015, two days after the accident. The Board held that the lack of notice was harmless error, as it did not change the outcome of the test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holton contends that, if provided written notice, he may have declined to take the drug test. While Mr. Holton posits that the requirement for written notice prior to testing avails the employee of the opportunity to refuse drug testing, we think that the notice is aimed at ensuring that the employee will be present at the drug test and be able to request deferral under appropriate circumstances. The purpose of notice is not to provide an opportunity to challenge the propriety of the test, a claim that may be raised as a defense to discipline. Indeed, if Mr. Holton had refused the drug test, he would have been subject to a variety of disciplinary actions, detailed in Navy Shipyard Portsmouth Instruction 12792.2B. The failure to provide written notice was ultimately not harmful error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holton points out that the regulation requires drug testing be "based on a police report," and argues that "Thayer did not review a police report as no such report existed." However, the Board found, and we agree, that the Police Desk Journal was sufficient to meet the police report requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frank v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 35 F.3d 1554, 1556-58 (Fed. Cir. 1994), declined to apply a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule requiring actions based on drug testing to be set aside for difficulties with the chain of custody of testing samples. The court distinguished <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's first challenge to the arbitrator's decision focuses on the agency's failure to adhere to DOT Order 3910.1B, which requires keeping the specimen and chain of custody forms under the control of the collector. Petitioner primarily relies upon the fact that his specimen was left unattended in the conference room for a short period of time, in direct violation of DOT procedures. The arbitrator concluded that this violation did not harm or prejudice petitioner because there was no evidence that any other person was in the conference room or had access to the room during the short period of time that the specimen was left unattended. Petitioner argues that the arbitrator erroneously required that petitioner prove that someone else tampered with the specimen while it lay unattended. Petitioner further argues that the agency should have been required to prove perfect compliance with its procedures because any non-compliance is <span class="Italic">per se</span> harmful and prejudicial error that is sufficient to invalidate a drug test. Essentially, we understand petitioner to be arguing that the failure of the agency to follow certain of its drug testing procedures should be deemed to have undermined the chain of custody over the specimen, thus rendering the evidence supporting the arbitrator's decision insubstantial. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By no means do we wish to trivialize the importance of the chain of custody over specimens, as well as the procedures necessary to ensure the chain is not broken. We are not prepared to say, however, that a violation of procedures automatically and fatally undermines the chain of custody. Each case must be considered on its own merits. The chain of custody must be strong enough so that, on the record as a whole, the decision of the arbitrator can be found to be supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, 8 F.3d at 804. Moreover, where there is procedural error on the part of the agency, the error does not require that the agency decision be overturned unless the error is shown to have been harmful.... Thus, we do not think that the adoption of the <span class="Italic">per se</span> standard urged by petitioner is warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the chain of custody in this case, the arbitrator found that the violation of DOT chain-of-custody procedures did not harm or prejudice petitioner because there was no evidence that any other person had access to the specimen during the short time it was left unattended. In other words, there was no evidence that someone other than petitioner had tampered with the specimen while it lay unattended. Substantial evidence supports this finding....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Petitioner was removed because it was found that he had submitted a specimen that was not urine. Substantial evidence supports the finding that the specimen petitioner submitted was not urine. None of the asserted errors have any bearing on this finding; thus, petitioner has failed to show that he was prejudiced or banned by the asserted errors.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The problems with the chain of custody in the present case do not rise to the level of those in <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, where we held that the arbitrator's finding that Dixon submitted a sample of water to the on-site collector was not supported by substantial evidence. 8 F.3d at 806. In <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, the collector had taped the water faucets in the restroom sink and had poured blue dye into the toilet. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, the on-site collector did not find any problem with the <span id="Page_1499"></span>sample Dixon submitted to him. Dixon's temperature strip indicated that his sample was in the acceptable temperature range, and the on-site collector testified that the color of the sample "looked okay" to him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At the same time, there was no indication that Dixon had with him the kind of apparatus that would have been required in order to make a specimen that was not urine have a temperature that was in the acceptable temperature range. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 806. In the present case, however, the problem with petitioner's sample was discovered immediately upon petitioner giving his sample to Mr. Scalercio, one of the on-site collectors. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Dixon</span>, unlike in the present case, there were two additional problems: (1) there was evidence, in the form of a wrinkled label, suggesting that the specimen container's seal had been tampered with before the container was opened by testing laboratory personnel; and (2) the testing laboratory receiving clerk, who first identified the problem with the color of the sample, was not identified on the custody-and-control form, and thus could not provide testimony. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 806-08.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Depending on the charges, the AJ may need to assess the medical significance of test results. Evidence of marijuana in urine does not demonstrate that an individual is under its influence was unfit for duty when the appellant was behaving normally and a supervisor had no reason to suspect that the appellant was under the influence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 45 MSPR 639, 642 (1990) (describing HHS testing standards); <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 466, 469 (1985) ("Here, although the applicable agency regulation in this case does not expressly define being under the influence of illegal drugs as being unfit for duty, it indicates that a similar standard is applied," <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Parker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 621 (1984)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency argued that a presumption of regularity in the drug testing process was not overcome by the appellant's denial of drug use, but the Board decided otherwise in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-12-0705-I-1 (NP 8/22/2013), involving a discrepancy about the date that a lab received a testing specimen:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues on petition for review that the chain of custody issue goes to the weight, not admissibility, of the evidence, and that the administrative judge improperly treated this issue as a question of law rather than a question of fact. The agency relies on the Third Circuit's analysis in <span class="Italic">United States v. Rawlins</span>, 606 F.3d 73, 83 (3d Cir. 2010), for the propositions that chain of custody issues go to weight not admissibility of the evidence and that the administrative judge's requirement that the agency prove a "perfect" chain of custody was "long rejected by the courts." The agency also cites the decision in <span class="Italic">Petway v. United States</span>, 28 Fed. Cl. 711, 715 (1993) for the proposition that the standard test for admissibility in criminal proceedings is "whether a urine sample originated from [the plaintiff] and was tested without adulteration by any intervening agent or cause."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's discussion of the chain of custody issue as one of admissibility versus weight is not compelling.[3] Notably, the agency acknowledges that the evidence in question "has already been admitted into the record." The administrative judge considered both documents as evidence, but he concluded--in the face of the appellant's denial of marijuana use in his testimony and the discrepancy in the documentary evidence--that the agency did not meet its burden of proof. The administrative judge's analysis is consistent with the Board's precedent in <span class="Italic">Storm</span> and <span class="Italic">Boykin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 56, 58 (1991), in which the Board held that the agency bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the test on which it relied to remove the appellant was valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the Third Circuit's decisions are persuasive, but not controlling, authority and decisions of the former U.S. Court of Claims have been adopted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as binding precedent until such time as the latter, sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, overrules such precedent. <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">South Corporation v. United States</span>, 690 F.2d 1368, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the agency's contention that the administrative judge's decision was improperly evaluated as a question of law, the agency has not persuaded us that any error made by the administrative judge in this regard was prejudicial to its substantive rights and we find no basis upon which to reverse the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's contention that the administrative judge misapplied the presumption of regularity as it relates to urinalysis testing is similarly unconvincing. It is well-established that, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, public officials are presumed to have properly discharged their official duties. <span class="Italic">United States v. Gregory</span>, 534 U.S. 1, 10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Social Security Administration</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 11 (2012). In his Bench Decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant's testimony--in which he denied using marijuana for more than 25 years and he testified that, at no time in 2011 or 2012 had he used marijuana--constituted such clear evidence. The administrative judge noted that the only evidence to refute the appellant's testimony was the lab report and documentary evidence relating to the drug test itself, the validity of which has been called into question as a result of the discrepancy noted above. The agency has not identified any persuasive precedent that the appellant's testimony during the hearing does not constitute clear evidence to overcome the presumption of regularity. <span class="Italic">Cf. Landvogt v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, No. 2013-3016, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 11361 (Fed. Cir. June 6, 2013) (noting that Ms. Landvogt's "unsworn and uncorroborated statement" did not undermine the presumption of regularity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the <span class="Italic">Rawlins</span> decision stands for the proposition that only actual proof of tampering constitutes clear evidence that would overcome the presumption of regularity, and it claims that this decision is consistent with the Fifth Circuit's analysis in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Wynne</span>, 533 F.3d 360 (5th Cir. 2008). We note that, in <span class="Italic">Rawlins</span>, 606 F.3d at 84-85, the Third Circuit applied the presumption of regularity to conclude that "the evidence placed in storage was properly transmitted to each of the chemists who testified," and it found that the District Court did not err when it admitted certain evidence. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 533 F.3d at 370, the Fifth Circuit, having balanced the "minor custody gap" against the fact that the urine sample arrived at the lab with the seal unbroken, found that the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records's decision to admit the sample was not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to substantial evidence. We find that both <span class="Italic">Rawlins</span> and <span class="Italic">Williams</span> are distinguishable. <span class="Italic">Rawlins</span> is distinguishable because the agency presented no live testimony on the chain of custody issue. In fact, the agency knew prior to the hearing that the appellant was challenging the chain of custody issue, but it did not offer any testimonial evidence in this regard. <span class="Italic">Williams</span> is distinguishable because the Fifth Circuit's decision does not mention, let alone discuss, the presumption of regularity in its analysis of the chain of custody issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chain of custody issues involving drug testing were considered in <span class="Italic">Forte v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 123 MSPR 124, 129-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-20, 2016 MSPB 1 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency relies on a positive drug test to take an adverse action against an employee, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the test was valid. <span class="Italic">See Boykin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 56, 58 (1991); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1)(ii). To meet its burden, the agency must establish that the urine sample that tested positive was the appellant's by showing that the chain of custody of the sample was maintained and verifiable. <span class="Italic">See Storm v. Department of the Army</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 14, 21 (1994); <span class="Italic">Boykin</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 58 (finding that a charge based on the appellant's positive drug test could not be sustained because the agency did not present testimony of a witness with knowledge of the chain of custody of the appellant's urine sample and thus failed to show that the urine sample was the appellant's).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A violation of the agency's drug-testing procedures does not "automatically and fatally" undermine the chain of custody, however. <span class="Italic">Frank v. Department of Transportation</span>, 35 F.3d 1554, 1557 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (declining to apply a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule requiring that adverse actions based on drug tests be set aside because of an agency's failure to follow its drug-testing procedures). Rather, the Board and our reviewing court have held that the harmful error standard is appropriate in reviewing a claim that an agency has violated procedures in administering a drug test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1557-58 (finding that the agency's violation of its chain-of-custody procedures by leaving a specimen unattended did not harm or prejudice the employee because there was no evidence that any other person had access to the specimen during the short time it was left unattended); <span class="Italic">Storm</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 22-24; <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Department of Transportation</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 550, 555 (1991). Reversal of an action for harmful error is warranted where the procedural error likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Henton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 15 (2006). To show harmful error, an appellant must prove that any procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the appellant alleged that there were irregularities in the urine drug test, and that the "drug testing facility violated chain of custody procedures when it collected the sample at issue," the administrative judge found that the appellant was not raising a harmful error claim as to the procedures regarding the random drug test. The administrative judge stated that she would "review the facts related to the collection of the urine specimen for purposes of weighing the evidence as to the validity of the urine specimen test." Accordingly, the administrative judge did not apply a harmful error standard in analyzing the appellant's allegations about errors involving the administration of the drug test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her determination that the agency failed to prove its charge by preponderant evidence, the administrative judge found that: the evidence of record establishes that an error in the collection of the urine specimen may have occurred; and the hair follicle test result is scientifically valid evidence that the appellant did not use cocaine during the time period included by the urine test. In addition, the administrative <span id="Page_1500"></span>judge noted as follows: the appellant consistently has stated that he has never used cocaine and that there must have been an error in either the collection or chain of custody of the urine sample; and during the course of litigation, the appellant requested a sample of the urine specimen so that it could be tested for DNA to verify whether the urine was actually his, but a sample was not produced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge properly found that there may have been an error in the collection of the appellant's urine specimen.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency challenges the administrative judge's finding that the evidence of record establishes that an error in the collection of the appellant's urine specimen may have occurred. At the hearing, the appellant and the individual who collected his urine specimen provided conflicting accounts of the collection process. The appellant testified that, as he was walking away from the testing restroom after providing his urine sample, the specimen collector called him back to the restroom and informed him that she had forgotten to have him initial the two vials containing his specimen. The appellant testified that when he returned to the restroom, the collector opened the bag with the vials containing his specimen, thereby breaking the seal on the bag, and he initialed the vials. He testified that the collector then took a new bag from the restroom counter, placed the vials in that bag and sealed it, and he initialed the new bag. The appellant further testified that about 10 minutes later, the agency's regional drug-free workplace coordinator asked him to initial another form that she had forgotten to have him sign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, the specimen collector testified that the appellant initialed the vials containing his urine specimen before leaving the testing restroom. She acknowledged that she called back the appellant after he had left the restroom, but stated that she did so to have him initial the Specimen Collection Checklist, not the vials. She further testified that she did not open another bag and that doing so would have required her to go to another room, as the testing restroom did not contain any extra drug-testing kits, which include the bag in which the vials containing the specimen are placed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge did not make any explicit credibility findings in the initial decision, she evidently credited the hearing testimony of the appellant over that of the specimen collector. The administrative judge rejected the agency's argument that the appellant's contention, that there was an irregularity in the urine collection process, is not credible because he signed the chain-of-custody form and did not raise the issue at the time of collection. The administrative judge found that "the appellant's failure to raise the issue at the time is understandable because he did not suspect that there was any problem at the time and underscores his consistent statement and actions that he has never used cocaine." In addition, the administrative judge discounted the collector's testimony that there was no irregularity in the collection of the appellant's urine specimen, finding that, "while the collector may not recall there being a problem, given the number of specimens she handled that particular day, she may genuinely have no memory of the issue."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency challenges the administrative judge's implied credibility finding on review, arguing that her "implicit belief of the appellant's version of events over that of the collector[ ] failed to consider the implausibility of the appellant's story, and is therefore erroneous." (citing <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458, 461 (1987) (stating that one of the factors that an administrative judge must consider in resolving credibility issues is the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events)). In support of this argument, the agency describes the protocol for collecting a urine sample, noting that a collector must restrict access to collection supplies before and during the collection and that the testing restroom does not contain extra drug-testing kits. The agency asserts that it is unreasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that an experienced collector would have deviated so far from required collection protocol as to stock the testing restroom with extra drug-testing kits. The agency also contends that the appellant's version of events leaves significant questions unanswered, such as "where did the collector get a new bag?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the agency's arguments unavailing. As noted above, the appellant testified that there were bags on the counter of the testing restroom. Thus, contrary to the agency's argument on review, the appellant's testimony does not leave unanswered the question of where the collector obtained a new bag. Moreover, the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing, and may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The agency's argument that the administrative judge erred in crediting the appellant's testimony as to what occurred during the collection process is, in essence, mere disagreement with the administrative judge's implied credibility findings and, as such, provides no basis for disturbing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings where she considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not show that the alleged error during the collection of his urine specimen is a harmful procedural error.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues on review that the administrative judge erred by failing to analyze the appellant's allegation that an error occurred during the collection of his urine specimen under a harmful error standard, and it asserts that the appellant did not satisfy that standard. Therefore, the agency contends, even assuming that an error in the collection of the urine specimen occurred, it does not negate the validity of the urine test and thus provides no basis for reversing the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, both the Board and our reviewing court have held that the harmful error standard is appropriate in reviewing an appellant's claim that an agency has violated procedures in administering a drug test. <span class="Italic">Frank</span>, 35 F.3d at 1557-58; <span class="Italic">Storm</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 22-24 (finding that the agency's failure to notify the appellant of his test results within 5 days of the test, as required by the HHS Guidelines, did not constitute harmful procedural error, and thus provided no basis for disturbing the agency's decision to remove the appellant, because he did not prove that the delay in reporting his test results likely caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error). In this case, the appellant claimed there was an irregularity in the collection of his urine sample in that the specimen collector failed to have him initial the vials containing his specimen before he left the testing restroom. Given that both the Board and our reviewing court have analyzed such allegations as harmful error claims, we agree with the agency that the administrative judge should have considered whether the alleged error in the collection process was a harmful procedural error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the agency that the appellant did not prove that the specimen collector's alleged failure to have him initial the vials containing his urine specimen before he left the testing restroom constituted harmful error. As noted above, to establish harmful error, an appellant must prove that a procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.4(r), 1201.56(c)(1); <span class="Italic">see Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991); <span class="Italic">Vincent</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 556. The agency suspended the appellant based on the positive results of the urine test and there is no evidence that those results would have been different if the specimen collector had directed the appellant to initial the sealed vials containing his specimen before he left the restroom, as required by HHS Guidelines, instead of calling him back to the restroom to do so after she had placed the vials in a bag and sealed the bag. <span class="Italic">See</span> 73 Fed. Reg. at 71885, Section 8.7 of the HHS Guidelines (providing that the specimen donor must initial the tamper-evident seals on each specimen bottle before the collector seals the bottles in a package for transfer to a testing laboratory); <span class="Italic">see also</span> HHS SAMHSA Urine Specimen Collection Handbook (describing the specimen collection process). Thus, the appellant has not shown that, in the absence of the alleged collection error, the agency likely would have reached a conclusion different from the one it reached. Accordingly, we modify the initial decision to find that the alleged collection error was not harmful. Therefore, the alleged collection error, standing alone, does not require reversal of the appellant's suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, however, the administrative judge did not conclude that the agency failed to prove its charge by preponderant evidence solely because an error in the collection of the appellant's urine specimen may have occurred. Rather, the administrative judge determined that the agency failed to prove its charge based on her consideration of the record in its entirety, and the possibility that an error occurred during the collection process was just one factor that the administrative judge cited in support of that determination. Consequently, the appellant's failure to show that the alleged error by the specimen collector was harmful (i.e., led to the positive test result) by itself does not warrant disturbing the administrative judge's finding that the agency failed to prove its charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Forte</span> went on to consider the evidentiary value of a hair follicle test offered by the employee and relied on by the AJ, <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 134-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-25:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge properly considered the result of the hair follicle test in finding that the agency failed to prove its charge.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, another factor that the administrative judge cited in support of her finding that the agency failed to meet its burden of proving its charge is the negative result of the hair follicle test. In the initial decision, the administrative judge noted that the Executive Order that authorizes the testing of Federal employees for illegal drug use provides that "[p]ositive drug test results may be rebutted by other evidence that an employee has not used illegal drugs." (citing Exec. Order No. 12,564, 51 Fed. Reg. 32889, 32891 (Sept. 15, 1986)). Based upon the relevant documentary evidence and hearing testimony, including the testimony of J.C. that hair follicle drug tests generally are accepted in the scientific community and that it would be unusual for a urine test to <span id="Page_1501"></span>show a positive result for cocaine and a hair follicle test covering the same time period to report a negative result for cocaine use, the administrative judge found that the hair follicle test result is scientifically valid evidence that the appellant did not use cocaine during the time period included by the urine test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency challenges this finding on review, arguing that the hair follicle test result is not scientifically valid because the appellant did not establish that the chain of custody of the hair follicle was properly maintained or that the laboratory testing procedures were accurate. More specifically, the agency argues that the appellant failed to show that the chain of custody for the hair follicle sample was properly maintained for two reasons: (1) the chain-of-custody form documenting the collection of the appellant's hair follicle sample was not signed and dated by the testing laboratory; and (2) the appellant did not produce any evidence showing that the chain of custody of the hair follicle specimen was maintained while the specimen was at the testing laboratory. As for the accuracy of the laboratory testing procedures, the agency asserts that the appellant did not produce any evidence regarding the tests conducted, the procedures followed, or the protocols observed by the testing laboratory during the testing of the appellant's hair follicle specimen. Therefore, the agency contends, the administrative judge erred in relying on the hair follicle test result in finding that the agency failed to prove the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the documentation regarding the hair follicle test is much less extensive than the documentation regarding the urine test. The record includes a 56-page litigation support package from the Fort Meade FTDTL, which documents the chain of custody for the urine specimen at the laboratory and the laboratory test results. The record does not contain the same information regarding the hair follicle test because the appellant did not order a litigation package from the laboratory that conducted that test. <span class="Italic">See</span> HT at 150-51 (testimony of the vice-president of the company that collected the appellant's hair follicle specimen).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree, however, with the agency's apparent assertion that the absence of such information renders the hair follicle test result scientifically invalid and thus not entitled to any consideration in determining whether the agency proved the charge. Rather, we find that, although the lack of detailed information regarding the hair follicle drug test detracts from the weight that otherwise would be afforded the negative result of that test, the result of the hair follicle test nonetheless is entitled to consideration as evidence showing that the appellant did not use cocaine during the period covered by the urine drug test. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly considered the result of the hair follicle test in determining whether the agency proved its charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The unavailability of the specimen for DNA testing due to the Army's refusal to release a sample of the urine specimen supports the administrative judge's finding that the agency failed to prove its charge.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another factor that the administrative judge cited in support of her finding that the agency failed to prove its charge is the appellant's unsuccessful effort to obtain a sample of his urine specimen for DNA testing so that he could prove that the urine specimen at issue actually did not belong to him. The appellant consistently has maintained that he has never used drugs and that the positive urine specimen did not belong to him. Thus, a key issue in this case is whether the urine specimen that tested positive for cocaine originated from the appellant. As previously noted, the appellant attempted to secure the specimen for DNA testing to rebut the agency's charge of illegal drug use by showing that the specimen at issue did not belong to him; however, he was unable to do so because the Army refused to release the sample based on its determination that the HHS Guidelines prohibit the use of urine specimens for any DNA testing, including, apparently, testing requested by the individual who provided the sample. The Army's refusal to produce the sample deprived the appellant of evidence that was critical to his efforts to rebut the validity of the positive test results by effectively denying him the opportunity to establish that the urine specimen did not belong to him. In light of these circumstances, we find that the urine drug test results are entitled to less weight than would be the case if the urine sample had been made available to the appellant for DNA testing. <span class="Italic">Cf. Banks v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 687 F.2d 92, 96 (5th Cir. 1982) (determining that a testing laboratory's disposal of urine samples required suppression of positive results of its tests in the appellants' removal appeals because the samples were not made available to the appellants for their independent testing and inspection). Therefore, we find the appellant's inability to establish that the urine sample that tested positive did not belong to him due to the Army's refusal to release the urine specimen supports the administrative judge's finding that the agency failed to prove its charge.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">To be admissible, a mandatory drug test may be required to be based on a demonstration of reasonable suspicion. <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 206 Fed. Appx. 986, 989 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), determined that the evidentiary basis was met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Davis primarily challenges the reasonable suspicion drug test. Davis argues that no just cause existed for the agency to have ordered the test and that the agency failed to follow its own policy in administering it. According to Davis, that constituted harmful error. Davis also challenges the Board's factual findings with respect to the narcotics discrepancies. Specifically, Davis contends that removal was not proper because the Board mischaracterized "charting errors" as "narcotics discrepancies." Notably, Davis does not challenge the underlying findings that he tested positive for morphine without a legal prescription and that he violated agency procedures by mishandling controlled narcotics.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the government argues that the agency acted within policy guidelines when it ordered the reasonable suspicion drug test, and that Davis fails to establish harmful error. Moreover, the government contends that substantial evidence supports the Board's findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that just cause existed for ordering the drug test. The VAMC's policy provides that an employee "shall be required to submit to reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol testing when, in the judgment of the appropriate management officials and based on information known at the time the decision to test is made, there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee...[h]as used...drugs or alcohol in violation of The Drug Free Workplace Policy" or "is subjected to a police investigation, arrest or conviction, related to drug or alcohol use, possession or distribution." Memorandum N121-35(3)(b)(1)(a),(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, substantial evidence exists in the record establishing reasonable suspicion. In particular, the AJ relied on the testimonies of Sgt. Rutt and Umlauf in concluding that Davis appeared to have taken narcotics from the Omnicell without administering the drugs to patients. In addition, Brown's voluntary witness statement describing the narcotics discrepancies also supports a finding of just cause. Moreover, at the time a drug test was ordered, the police investigation headed by Sgt. Rutt had already begun, thus serving as a second basis for ordering the drug test under the policy.</p>
