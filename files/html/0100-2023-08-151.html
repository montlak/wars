<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-150"><span class="space">b.</span> Student Temporary Employment Program; Recent Graduates Program; Student Career Experience Program</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burnett v. DHUD</span>, 114 MSPR 1, 3-4 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8, 2010 MSPB 68 (2010), considering the Student Temporary Employment Program, eschewed jurisdiction to consider the termination of an employee who served less than two years in the program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that on June 13, 2006, the appellant, a non-preference eligible, accepted a temporary excepted service position with the agency as a GS-7 Program Assistant. Her appointment, which was not to exceed September 30, 2006, was under the Student Temporary Employment Program (STEP) pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(a). Such appointments are not to exceed 1 year and may be extended in 1-year increments. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(a)(10)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency extended the appellant's original appointment, effective October 1, 2006, and on September 30, 2007, it extended the appointment again, this time indicating that it was not to exceed September 28, 2008. On March 7, 2008, however, the agency terminated the appellant's appointment because she was no longer enrolled as a student. The appellant argued below that the agency should not have terminated her as it did because she did not actually graduate until 3 months after the termination date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who is involuntarily separated for cause is entitled to appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d), only if the person meets the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 4, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 161 Fed. Appx. 945 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 4 (2005). As a non-preference eligible in the excepted service, the appellant had to satisfy the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), which provides that an "employee" means:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant only need satisfy the requirements under (C)(i) or (C)(ii) in order to be an employee with adverse action appeal rights; she need not satisfy both sets of requirements. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address whether the appellant satisfies the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). As noted above, the agency appointed her to her position under the STEP Program. Such appointments are not eligible for non-competitive conversion to career or career-conditional appointments, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(a)(10)(iii), and may only be converted to Student Career Experience Program appointments, which are themselves in the excepted service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(a)(10)(iii), (15). Therefore, the appellant was not serving under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service and is not an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). <span class="Italic">See Forest v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 47 F.3d 409, 412 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see also Johnson,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next address whether the appellant satisfies the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Her initial appointment was effective June 13, 2006, and the agency terminated her effective March 7, 2008, less than 2 years later. Therefore, she lacked 2 years of current continuous service. Moreover, all of her appointments were temporary and limited to 2 years or less. Nor does the appellant's service with the Department of the Army, which ended in 1994, render her an "employee" because "current continuous service" means service immediately prior to the action at issue without a break in service of a work day. <span class="Italic">See McCrary v. Department of the Army,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6; 8 (2006). Therefore, the appellant is not an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant failed to qualify as an employee with appeal rights when his appointment under the Recent Graduates Program was terminated before two years of service, <span class="Italic">Thap v. SSA</span>, DE-3443-16-0037-I-1 (NP 6/24/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service, the appellant was entitled to appeal to the Board if, at the time of his termination, he was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 5 (2012); <span class="Italic">Ellefson v. Department of the Arm</span>y, 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 8 (2005). That section defines an employee as an individual who (1) is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or (2) has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i)-(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that he is an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i), because even assuming that he was serving under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, he failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was not serving a trial period at the time of his termination. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 6. The agency terminated the appellant after approximately 1 year and 2 months of his Recent Graduates Program appointment of up to 2 years and 120 days, the entire duration of which was a trial period. Furthermore, the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege, either below on review, that he had prior service that could be tacked on to his Recent Graduates Program service so as to complete his trial period. <span class="Italic">See McCrary v. Department of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15 (2006) (finding that an individual whose excepted service Federal Career Intern Program appointment was terminated during its 2-year trial period had appeal rights under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) because she was entitled to credit toward completion of the trial period based on her prior service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, based on our review, the record does not indicate that the appellant had prior service that could be tacked on to complete his trial period. An individual's prior service may be tacked toward the <span id="Page_238"></span>completion of a trial period in the excepted service where the prior service was: (1) performed in the same agency; (2) performed in the same line of work; and (3) completed with no more than 1 break in service of less than 30 days. <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 6. Here, the Standard Form 50 (SF-50) documenting the appellant's appointment to the Claims Representative position reflects a service computation date of May 31, 2014, approximately 2 months prior to his Recent Graduates Program appointment to the Claims Representative Position. However, even assuming that the appellant served in another position that qualified for tacking for approximately 2 months, these additional 2 months of service would be insufficient to complete his trial period, which was at least 2 years. The agency also submitted SF-50s indicating that the appellant had approximately 2 months of prior service with the agency between January 26, 2014, and March 22, 2014, under a term appointment to a part-time Personal Assistant position. However, this service cannot be tacked towards the completion of the appellant's trial period, because there was a break in service of greater than 30 days. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 6. For this reason, and for the reasons discussed above, the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he is an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we find that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he qualifies as an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). The appellant has not alleged, either below or on review, that he had 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Moreover, our review of the record does not reflect that the appellant had such service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time on review, the appellant contends that his appointment under the Recent Graduates Program did not begin until May 27, 2015, and that he served in the Claims Representative position under another unspecified appointment between July 2014 and his Recent Graduates Program appointment. Based on these alleged facts, the appellant contends that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. He does not explain his failure to respond to the acknowledgment order or the agency's motion to dismiss below. Nevertheless, because the appellant alleges that his new argument implicates the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal, and the issue of jurisdiction is always before the Board and may be raised by any party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board at any time during a Board proceeding, we will consider it. <span class="Italic">See Lovoy v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 571, &#x00B6; 30 (2003). Even assuming that, contrary to the appellant's SF-50 in the record below, his appointment under the Recent Graduates Program did not begin until May 27, 2015, this would fail to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that he qualified as an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) or (ii). Therefore, we find that the appellant's new argument on review does not raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arojuraye v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-10-0236-I-1 (NP 11/1/2010), explained appeal rights of Student Career Experience Program employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his May 20, 2010 petition for review, the appellant asserts that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal because his Student Career Experience Program (SCEP) appointment only required him to serve a 1-year probationary period and not a 2-year probationary period as claimed by the agency. As a non-preference eligible in the excepted service, to be entitled to Board appeal rights the appellant had to satisfy the definition of employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), which provides that an "employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not meet the requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) because "the Board has found that SCEP appointments constitute probationary or trial periods under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service and that such appointees do not gain adverse action appeal rights under (C)(i) until they are converted to the competitive service." <span class="Italic">Yeressian v. Department of the Army</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). In addition, the appellant does not meet the requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because he had no prior federal experience prior to his SCEP appointment, had completed less than 2 years as a Student Trainee in the SCEP at the time of his termination, and therefore did not have 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less. While the appellant's initial SF-50, effective January 7, 2008, incorrectly indicated that his appointment was subject to a 1-year probationary period, "it is well settled that an 'SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights.'" <span class="Italic">See Lopez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board need not address the assertions the appellant makes on review regarding the merits of his case.

<p class="Body-Text">Students may be noncompetitively converted from the Student Career Experience Program to a term, career, or career-conditional appointment, but the regulations do not guarantee permanent positions (or tenure to appeal to MSPB) when they successfully complete program requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ide v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who is preference-eligible, was appointed on July 21, 2008, as a Student Trainee (Material Expediter) under the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP) at the Corpus Christi, Texas, Army Depot. The appointment, which was in the excepted service, was subject to a 1-year probationary period. The Standard Form (SF) 50 for the appointment stated that it was</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">intended to continue through completion of education and study-related work requirements. An agency may noncompetitively appoint you to a career or career-conditional appointment within 120 days after satisfactory completion of your education program and satisfactory completion of at least 640 hours of career-related work experience.</p>

In addition, under SCEP regulations, an individual to be converted must receive a favorable recommendation from a management official in the area in which the job-related experience was acquired and be qualified for the job to which the individual is converted. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(b)(11)(i)(C)-(D).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 19, 2010, the agency proposed the appellant's removal during her trial period because, although she had met the education and work requirements, she had not received a favorable recommendation from management for conversion to the competitive service. The proposal cited her inattention to safety, based on 4 incidents. On December 1, 2010, the agency issued a decision sustaining the proposal that the appellant would not be converted to a competitive service appointment and stating that her termination was effective December 3, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to have Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, an individual must be an "employee" and must have suffered an "adverse action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a), 7512(1), 7513(d). In this case, we find that the appellant is an employee within the statutory definition but that the agency did not take an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the administrative judge analyzed whether the appellant was an employee under the wrong statutory provision, i.e., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). That provision states that an employee is an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service or who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less. However, as noted above, the appellant was preference eligible. Therefore, the correct inquiry is whether she was an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), i.e., a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an executive agency or the U.S. Postal Service. Unlike 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) does not exclude an individual serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of her termination, the appellant had served in the Student Trainee (Material Expediter) position under SCEP from July 21, 2008, through December 3, 2010. Therefore, she was an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), i.e., a preference eligible in the excepted service who had completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same <span id="Page_239"></span>position in an executive agency. <span class="Italic">See Yeressian v. Department of the Army,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) (finding that a non-preference eligible was an employee after completing 2 years under SCEP); <span class="Italic">Scull v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">"Nevertheless, the appellant's status as an employee with adverse action appeal rights has no bearing on the question of whether [she] was actually subjected to an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Scull,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10. An adverse action includes a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade, a reduction in pay and a furlough of 30 days or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1)-(5). The appellant was not subjected to any of these actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The Board has consistently held that when an expiration date of an appointment is specified as a basic condition of employment, the expiration of the appointment is not an adverse action appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Endermuhle v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under SCEP regulations, a student may be appointed to SCEP if he is in an educational program seeking a high school diploma, a vocational/technical certificate, or an associate, baccalaureate, graduate or professional degree in an accredited institution. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(b)(1). After completing the educational program and 640 hours of work experience and receiving a favorable recommendation, the individual "may be noncompetitively converted to a competitive service position for which he is qualified. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 213.3202(b)(11)(i)(A)-(D). However, there is no mandate that the agency convert a SCEP appointee; under the regulations, it may do so only if the individual meets all the regulatory requirements, and it has a 120-day deadline for doing so. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(b)(10)(ii), (b)(11)(i)(A)-(D). The regulations do not provide the individual with any continued right to employment if he is not converted. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Scull,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 15. Further, it is inconsequential that a SCEP appointee's appointment does not have a date certain on which it will expire, since it was clearly tied to her completion of the program requirements and the agency's decision whether to convert her to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Endermuhle,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 9. Thus, the termination of the appellant's employment because she was not converted is not an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Scull,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency's decision terminating the appellant's appointment stated that she had appeal rights to the Board. However, the mere fact that the agency informs an appellant of a right of appeal does not confer jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">Morales v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the SF 50 for the appellant's termination states that it was a removal under the authority of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 as the authority for her termination. The cited statutory provision provides that an agency may take an adverse action against an employee only when it will promote the efficiency of the service. While an executed SF 50 is the customary documentation for a personnel action, it does not constitute the personnel action itself, and does not on its face control an employee's status and rights. <span class="Italic">Hunt-O'Neal v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6; 10 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Department of Commerce,</span> 729 F.2d 772, 774-76 (Fed.
