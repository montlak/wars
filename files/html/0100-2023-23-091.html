<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-90"><span class="space">15.</span> Interim Promotion; WIGI; Pay Increase</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Without a law requiring a promotion or facts establishing a clear entitlement to a retroactive promotion, an employee is not automatically entitled to a promotion upon reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 50 MSPR 686, 697 (1991). The possibility or probability of promotion is insufficient to justify a pay increase in back pay computations. If the employee had an excellent performance record prior to his unjustified removal, he still may not be able to clearly establish his entitlement to an intervening promotion, although he may nevertheless be entitled to promotion consideration as part of his relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d 258 (Ct. Cl. 1979); <span class="Italic">Nelson v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 133, 136 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Power</span>, "where appellant was not absolved of misconduct...he has failed to show he should have been promoted or that he is entitled to be considered for promotion"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 120, 126 (1997) ("Where the Board reverses an appealable action, an employee is entitled to a promotion in a compliance proceeding only where some provision of law mandates it or he establishes that he would, in fact, have been promoted."). The AJ may resolve the claimed entitlement to interim promotion through evidentiary submissions required of both parties through a scheduling order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. EEOC</span>, 45 MSPR 229, 232-33 (1990). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">Chapter 1</a> for USERRA decisions involving consideration of employees for promotion while they are in military service.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the oft-cited <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d 258 (Ct. Cl. 1979):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The possibility or mere probability of promotion, however, is not sufficient for this factor to receive consideration in connection with a determination as to the level of pay on which the plaintiff's recovery is to be computed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are numerous decisions by this court announcing the general rule that a civilian employee of the Government, or a member of the Armed Forces, is entitled only of the rights and salary of the position to which such person has been administratively appointed. <span class="Italic">E. g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Bielec v. United States,</span> 456 F.2d 690, 696, 197 Ct. Cl. 550, 560 (1972); <span class="Italic">Peters v. United States</span>, 534 F.2d 232, 234, 208 Ct. Cl. 373, 377 (1975). In order to recover on the basis of the salary of a higher position than that to which a claimant has actually been appointed, the claimant must normally show a legal entitlement to the pay of the higher position. <span class="Italic">Selman v. United States,</span> 498 F.2d 1354, 1358, 204 Ct. Cl. 675, 684 (1974); <span class="Italic">Doggett v. United States,</span> 207 Ct. Cl. 478, 482 (1975). Possibly the Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 990-2 may qualify this requirement somewhat when it provides for back pay on the basis of a higher grade if it is "clearly established" that the promotion would have occurred but for the improper personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plaintiff in the present case does not contend that the Department of the Army would have been under a mandatory duty to promote him to grade GS-11 as of October 1, 1972--or any other time--if he had continued in the service after September 18, 1972. Nor is it "clearly established" that he would have been promoted. His claim to the salary of the higher grade is based only upon hope, and perhaps reasonable expectation. Consequently, under all the authorities, this claim must be rejected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal from the Court of Federal Claims involving construction of an EEO settlement, the court commented on entitlement to promotion based on expectations or assurances, <span class="Italic">Eby v. United States</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1932.OPINION.7-17-2020_1620495.pdf">823 Fed. Appx. 933</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that potential discretionary promotions that are subject to a competitive process cannot provide the requisite reasonable certainty necessary to prove expectation damages. In a case involving private parties, the Supreme Court has held that, even where an employee might be given preference when applying for a promotion, the likelihood of that potential promotion is too speculative to sustain an expectation damages award. <span class="Italic">See Richmond &#x0026; D.R. Co. v. Elliot</span>, 149 U.S. 266, 268 (1893). In the government employment context, our predecessor court held that the possibility of a promotion, or even the probability of a promotion, is insufficient to sustain back pay awards at the higher pay grade. <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d 258, 262 (Ct. Cl. 1979). Government agencies are responsible, moreover, for setting the pay grades of each job within the agency. An employee may advance to a higher pay grade only up to the <span id="Page_4896"></span>maximum pay grade advertised in the job announcement. Pay &#x0026; Leave Pay Systems, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-dataoversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-dataoversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/general-schedule/</a>. Employees may advance to pay grades higher than advertised in the job announcement only by competing with other applicants on a merit system. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. These precedents and the nature of government agency pay grades confirm that the Claims Court's resolution of this issue was correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the FDA position at issue identified GS-13 as the maximum pay level the employee could attain. To advance to a GS-14 position, Eby would have been required to compete with other applicants. The competitive nature of such a promotion, and the discretion that the FDA could exercise in promoting Eby, make Eby's claimed damages for GS-14 wages speculative. Eby contends that it was highly likely she would be promoted to a GS-14 position because she had worked at that level before and was a desirable employee, and that her supervisors represented to her that accepting particular GS-13 positions (including the particular Regulatory Health Project Coordinator she applied for in 2010) were likely to lead to a promotion to a GS-14 position. We do not find these arguments persuasive. These assertions do not show, with any degree of certainty, that Eby would have been promoted to the GS 14 level. At most they show that there was a good chance that Eby would be promoted. Missing is a showing of a reasonable certainty of promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this context, we may not rely on Eby's arguments regarding the promotion of other FDA employees. Eby argues that, since May 2009, eight out of ten FDA employees were promoted from the GS-13 level to the GS-14 level within two years of being hired to GS-13 positions. Additionally, Eby points to five individuals within the Office of Oncology and Hematology that were promoted to the GS14 level within two years of being hired as GS-13 Project Coordinators or Project Managers. Again, these examples show that there may have been a good chance that Eby would be promoted, but they do not satisfy the reasonable certainty standard we must employ. In fact, these examples lend support to the opposite conclusion: each individual to whom Eby points was promoted only after applying to a GS-14 vacancy and undergoing a competitive selection process. At most, these examples demonstrate that promotion to a GS-14 level was a competitive process within the discretion of the FDA that often resulted in promotion, but not always. a promotion, and the discretion that the FDA could exercise</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Covert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 376, 380-83 (1986), stated the Board's views of promotion claims for reinstated employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, with regard to appellant's contention that had he not been the subject of an improper personnel action, he would now be a GS-8, the regional director found that appellant had not cited any court or Board decision which grants the Board the power to grant such relief. Absent such authority or evidence of appellant's entitlement to such an absolute career promotion advancement, the Board will not merely speculate on where appellant might be today in terms of career advancement had he not been separated. Accordingly, the regional director concluded that the relief of placing the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> requires only that the employee be returned to the same or a substantially equivalent position with appropriate back pay and benefits....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the regional director concluded, he had no authority to place appellant in a better position than he was in at the time of the agency action....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit takes the same basic approach toward interim promotion, <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Only if some provision of law mandates a promotion during the interim period, or perhaps if the employee could "clearly establish" that he would in fact have been promoted, would the agency be required to reinstate him at that higher level. <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d 258, 261-62 (Ct. Cl. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 444 U.S. 1044 (1980). In this instance there is no such mandatory requirement, nor did petitioner present any evidence showing very plainly that he would have been promoted to the level he now claims. His argument on such promotion is purely speculative, and based on flimsy possibilities unsupported by any hard facts or evidence. The MSPB's decisions on this score cannot be faulted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After <span class="Italic">Boese</span>, the Board again expressed its disinclination to order interim promotions, <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 32 MSPR 488, 492 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends that he was entitled to be reinstated at the GS-13 pay level because the agency has a nondiscretionary "up-or-out" promotion policy and, therefore, his back pay must be calculated at the GS-9, -11, and -13 pay levels, respectively, for each consecutive year that he would have been employed but for his improper removal. The agency's obligation, however, was to place appellant as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). "Only if some provision of law mandates a promotion during the interim period or perhaps if the employee could 'clearly establish' that he would in fact have been promoted, would the agency be required to reinstate him at that higher level." <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The possibility or mere probability of promotion without competition is not sufficient to receive consideration in determining, on petition for enforcement, the level of pay on which an employee's recovery is to be computed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 27 MSPR 133, 135-36 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, the Comptroller General has determined that an improperly separated air traffic controller is not entitled to a retroactive promotion unless the facts clearly establish that he or she would have completed all training and certification requirements for promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Janet L. Apple</span>, B-214659 at 3-4 (Comp. Gen. Feb. 12, 1985). Appellant has not presented such facts as to establish a clear entitlement to retroactive promotion in this case. Further, because appellant was not promoted or clearly entitled to retroactive promotion...he has no entitlement to the benefits and emoluments of such positions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392 (1976)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Naekel</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 850 F.2d 682, 683-84 (Fed. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We affirm the board's decision that Mr. Naekel was entitled to back pay at GS-9, but not at GS-11, GS-12, and GS-13 respectively for each consecutive year that he would have been employed but for his improper removal. Naekel neither demonstrated that any statute, regulation or collective bargaining agreement mandated his promotion to these levels during the interim period, nor presented facts that would establish a clear entitlement to retroactive promotion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A government employee may not receive the benefits of a position until he is appointed to it. <span class="Italic">Testan</span>... Accordingly, for an employee to meet his heavy burden of establishing a clear entitlement to retroactive promotion and the resulting back pay, he must demonstrate a reduction in his duly appointed or authorized position caused by the adverse personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Horner</span>, 654 F. Supp. 1159, 1167 (D.D.C. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A retroactive promotion and back pay are appropriate for a duly appointed position if the appropriate authorizing official approved the promotion, but due to a clerical error, the effective date was delayed. Conversely, retroactive promotion and back pay are inappropriate if the clerical error delays the approval of the promotion by the appropriate authorizing official. A retroactive promotion and back pay are appropriate for a duly authorized position if a mandatory personnel policy established by regulation or collective bargaining agreement required promotion on successful completion of a training phase, the employee successfully completed the program, but the employee was denied promotion due to administrative error. Conversely, promotion and back pay are inappropriate if the employee would have been only one of several qualified candidates for the promotion, but the factual record did not clearly establish that the employee would have been selected for promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual, Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subch. S8-5, at 550-61 (April 20, 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Naekel has not met his burden in this case because his promotion cannot be presumed based on the evidence of record here. At best, to assume he would have been promoted is speculative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d 258, 261-62 (Ct. Cl. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 444 U.S. 1044 (1980) (possibility or mere probability not sufficient). It is undisputed that, if Naekel had not been removed from his position, he would have had to complete successfully several phases of training in the air traffic controller program in order to be promoted. Naekel did not complete that training. He produced no evidence that he would have successfully done so. There was, moreover, nothing in the record to demonstrate that completion of the training was a mere formality. Further, the record lacks any evidence that Naekel demonstrated an ability to perform the duties of the higher-graded positions to which he seeks retroactive promotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 156, 160-61 (1988), declined to award retroactive promotion to an appellant who prevailed in his mixed case appeal to EEOC. The Board described as insufficient the appellant's proof of his right to an interim promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's affidavit which he introduced to support his claims to other promotions also fails to establish these claims. His opinion that his qualifications were as good as those of the selectees for three higher level positions is insufficient to show that appellant would have been selected. His assertion that he was more qualified than the selectees for three other vacancies because the selectees were subordinate to him at the time of his removal is unsupported by any evidence concerning the qualifications for the positions showing that this fact alone would have controlled the selection. As the administrative judge found, appellant's arguments and affidavit statements are speculative in nature and fail to establish that he would have been promoted to any of the positions he cites.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant objects to the legal standard employed by the administrative judge, but he fails to address the precedents she cites which place the burden squarely on the employee to "clearly establish" that he would have been promoted during the interim had he not been removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span id="Page_4897"></span><span class="Italic">Power v. United States,</span> 597 F.2d 258, 261-62, 220 Ct.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to provide interim promotion in a VEOA nonselection case, <span class="Italic">Dow v. GSA</span>, 117 MSPR 616, 623 &#x00B6; 18, 2012 MSPB 22 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency must offer him a job at the GS-12 level to account for the promotions he would have received while in the CPO Intern position. The established rule is that one is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been appointed to it. <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan,</span> 424 U.S. 392, 402 (1976). "Only if some provision of law mandates a promotion during the interim period, perhaps if the employee could 'clearly establish' that he would in fact have been promoted, would the agency be required to reinstate him at that higher level." <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (citing <span class="Italic">Power v. United States,</span> 597 F.2d 258, 261-62 (1979)). The appellant has not identified any law mandating such a promotion, nor has he clearly established that he would have been promoted. Instead, he argues that we should presume that his performance would have been satisfactory and that he would have attained a GS-12 pay grade "in or about 2003." The Federal Circuit has rejected such a presumption. "At best, to assume that he would have been promoted is speculative." <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation,</span> 850 F.2d 682, 684 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Power</span>, 597 F.2d at 261-62). Therefore, the agency may properly place the appellant in the GS-7 pay grade.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interim promotion was available in a reprisal case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 81 MSPR 48, 53-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16 (1999) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-119.html#sec16-117">Monetary Relief for Prohibited Personnel Practices Not Covered by the WPA or EEO Law")</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not direct what appear to be routine career-ladder advancements if the agency offers a good reason for not advancing the employee, <span class="Italic">Rickels v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 596, 602-03 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the issues to be resolved in this case was whether the appellant's reinstatement in the same position, in a GS-5, Step 3 grade, satisfied the agency's obligation to place him as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. See Boese v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force,</span> 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We are not persuaded by the appellant's contention that, under his agency's career ladder progression plan, he would have been promoted to a GS-7 grade level if not for the agency's procedurally defective removal action. It is well established that, "only if some provision of law mandates a promotion during the interim period or perhaps if the employee could 'clearly establish' that he would in fact have been promoted, would the agency be required to reinstate him at that higher level." <span class="Italic">See Power v. United States,</span> 597 F.2d 258, 261-262, 220 Ct. Cl. 157 (Ct. Cl. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 444 U.S. 1044, 100 S. Ct. 731, 62 L.

Department of Transportation,</span> 32 MSPR 488, 492 (1987), <span class="Italic">reversed in part on other grounds, vacated in part</span>, 850 F.2d 682 (1988). In this case, there is no such mandatory requirement, nor did the appellant clearly establish that his promotion would have been effected had he not been wrongfully removed. The evidence demonstrates that, although the appellant was fully successful at his job for one year, and although others, trained at the same time, had been promoted, the appellant was the only employee in his training group who did not receive his badge and credentials at the conclusion of the training period. In an analogous case, where an air traffic controller could not establish that he had completed all training and <span class="Italic">certification requirements</span> for promotion, he was not entitled to a retroactive promotion. <span class="Italic">See Naekel</span>, 32 MSPR at 488....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">New v. VA</span>, 293 Fed. Appx. 779, 781 (Fed.

Dept. of Interior</span>, 70 MSPR 182, 188 (1996) ("In order to be returned to a higher grade than the one he held at the time of his removal, the appellant has to establish that he would have been promoted to GS-9 had he not been removed, or that there was a mandatory requirement that the agency promote him to GS-9.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if the agency does not come up with a good reason for denying a career ladder promotion that an appellant might have earned during a period of improper termination, the burden of proof remains on the appellant to demonstrate entitlement to the career promotion, <span class="Italic">Jones v. OPM</span>, SF-0731-09-0911-C-1 (NP 6/24/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant reasserts on review that he should have been retroactively promoted to the GS-7 level, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant is not entitled to be promoted. As set forth in <span class="Italic">Dow</span>, the established rule is that one is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been appointed to it. <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 402 (1976). "Only if some provision of law mandates a promotion during the interim period, or perhaps if the employee could 'clearly establish' that he would in fact have been promoted, would the agency be required to reinstate him at that higher level." <span class="Italic">Boese v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the vacancy announcement under which the appellant applied for the Surgical Technician position stated that the position "may be filled at either the GS-6 or GS-7 level. If filled at the lower grade, incumbent may be promoted without further competition upon satisfactory performance and meeting all qualification/regulatory requirements." While the appellant argues on review that there is no "proof or evidence that he wouldn't have gotten a promotion to the GS-7 level" if not for the agency's wrongful removal action against him, the appellant has not identified any law mandating such a promotion, nor has he clearly established that he would have been promoted. Instead, he essentially argues that we should presume that his performance would have been satisfactory and that he would have attained a GS-7 pay grade on February 2, 2010. However, the record reflects that the appellant only held the position of Surgical Technician, GS-6, for a month. Upon learning that the appellant lacked the formal training and substantive experience necessary for the Surgical Technician position, he was reassigned to work in the laundry department. Thus, the record does not support a presumption that the appellant would have been promoted to the GS-7 position. Moreover, the Federal Circuit has rejected such a presumption. <span class="Italic">See Dow</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 18. "At best, to assume that he would have been promoted is speculative." <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 850 F.2d 682, 684 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Power</span>, 597 F.2d at 261-62). Therefore, the agency may properly reinstate the appellant to the GS-6 pay grade. Accordingly, the appellant has shown no error in the administrative judge's denial of his petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency is supposed to grant what amounts to a career promotion before removing an individual who is reinstated and the agency fails to provide justification for not promoting the employee following her reinstatement, the Board will direct the agency to promote the employee, <span class="Italic">Pernell v. VA</span>, 118 MSPR 15, 16-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 2012 MSPB 50 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal challenging her termination from her position as a GS-9 Prosthetic Representative during her probationary period. The administrative judge reversed the agency's action, finding that the appellant was an employee who was removed without minimum due process. The administrative judge ordered the agency, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to cancel the appellant's termination, retroactively restore her effective December 6, 2009, pay her the appropriate amount of back pay, and adjust her benefits with appropriate credits and deductions in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) regulations. This decision became final when neither party petitioned for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant thereafter filed a petition for enforcement of the Board's order. Therein, the appellant asserts that the agency has not complied with the Board's order because it failed to promote her to the GS-11 pay grade upon reinstatement. Specifically, the appellant claims that the position that she held was a "Target GS-11" position, and she was scheduled for a promotion in grade on December 7, 2009, to GS-11 Step 1. Instead of the promotion in grade, however, the appellant received only a step increase from GS-9 Step 1 to GS-9 Step 2. She attached her sworn declaration and supporting documentation indicating that she had been rated "fully successful" on December 4, 2009, and she contended that, pursuant to the terms of the governing collective bargaining agreement, she was thereby entitled to be certified for a promotion to the next pay grade effective December 6, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the appellant's allegations, the agency claimed that the appellant was properly returned to her GS-9 position. The agency acknowledged that, on December 4, 2009, Jacqueline Brown, Assistant Chief of Prosthetics, signed a VA Form 3482e, "Executive Career Field (ECF) Performance Appraisal," indicating that the appellant's performance ratings for all critical and non-critical elements, as well as her summary rating, were "fully successful" for the period December 7, 2008, to September 30, 2009. It claimed, however, that the rating was issued as a result of administrative error. The agency claimed that because Brown was not the appellant's "rating supervisor," Brown had no authority to rate the appellant and that the rating signed by Brown therefore was not the appellant's rating of record. The agency further claimed that the appellant's "official rater" was Elizabeth Shellman, Acting Chief of Prosthetics, that Shellman had rated the appellant as "unsatisfactory" on November 9, 2009, that the document signed by Shellman was the appellant's rating of record for the relevant time period, and that Shellman's rating rendered the appellant ineligible to be promoted upon her reinstatement to the GS-11 position. In support of its claims, the agency provided a copy of a VA Form 5-4645, "Request for Review of Employee's Probationary or Trial Period" dated November 17, 2009, signed by Shellman, and indicating that the appellant's work was unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge thereafter denied the appellant's petition for enforcement based on the written record. She rejected the appellant's claim that she should have been promoted to a GS-11 position, determining that, although Brown had rated her as "fully successful" on December 4, 2009, that rating was given in error and Brown had no authority to rate the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4898"></span>An agency bears the burden of proving its compliance with a Board order, and assertions of compliance must be supported by relevant, material, and credible evidence in the form of documentation or affidavits. <span class="Italic">New v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 217, &#x00B6; 6 (2007),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 293 F. App'x 779 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 438, 442 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no dispute that, if the appellant had received a rating of at least fully successful for the 2008-09 appraisal period, she would be entitled to a promotion in grade to GS-11. <span class="Italic">See</span> CF, Tab 9 at 2 ("The Agency would have no problem promoting Appellant to a GS 11 target if Appellant had actually performed at the fully successful level for the 2009 rating period."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> CF, Tab 1 at 21 (collective bargaining agreement provision stating that "[if] an employee is rated as successful and is meeting the promotion criteria in the career ladder plan, the Department will certify the promotion which will be effective at the beginning of the first pay period after the requirements are met").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, the VA Form 3482e Brown signed on December 4, 2009, which indicates that the appellant's performance rating was "fully successful" for the period December 7, 2008, to September 30, 2009, satisfies OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 430 concerning planning, monitoring and rating performance. Specifically, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208(a) requires agencies to issue employees "a written, or otherwise recorded, rating of record" at the conclusion of the appraisal period. Further, section 430.203 explains that a "rating of record" evaluates performance over the entire appraisal period and requires the assignment of a "summary level" rating. Section 430.208(d) permits agencies to implement performance appraisal systems to include between two and five summary rating levels. Here, the VA Form 3482e is a performance rating; it was prepared at the end of the appellant's appraisal period; and it includes the assignment of a summary level of "fully successful" within a pattern of five summary rating levels. Thus, we find that the VA Form 3482e is a "rating of record" within the meaning of OPM's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, however, determined that the Form 3482e signed by Brown was ineffective to serve as the appellant's official performance rating because it was issued as the result of an administrative error. We disagree. Section 430.208(a)(3) of part 430 provides that, "[e]xcept as provided in &#x00A7; 430.208(i), a rating of record is final when it is issued to an employee with all appropriate reviews and signatures." Thus, the appellant's December 4, 2009 rating of record was final unless the agency took action falling within the provisions of section 430.208(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication that the agency did so here. Section 430.208(i) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;When either a regular appraisal period or an extended appraisal period ends and any agency-established deadline for providing ratings of record passes or a subsequent rating of record is issued, an agency shall not produce or change retroactively a rating of record that covers that earlier appraisal period except that a rating of record may be changed--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;As a result of a grievance, complaint, or other formal proceeding permitted by law or regulation that results in a final determination by appropriate authority that the rating of record must be changed or as part of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> settlement of a formal proceeding; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Where the agency determines that a rating of record was incorrectly recorded or calculated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no indication that the appellant ever made a request that her rating be changed, nor is there any suggestion that the agency took any action as the result of a grievance, complaint, or other formal proceeding. Although the agency's argument could be construed as a claim that the appellant's rating of record was "incorrectly recorded or calculated" because Brown allegedly had no authority to issue it, there is no evidence in the record that the agency ever "changed" that rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, it is undisputed that the agency granted the appellant a within-grade increase to GS-9 Step 2 upon reinstatement. Such action would be permissible under OPM's regulations only if the appellant's most recent rating of record was "fully successful." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.404(a). Furthermore, as stated above, if the agency believed that the within-grade increase decision was inconsistent with the appellant's most recent rating of record, it was required to prepare a more current rating of record. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.404(a)(1). Because the agency failed to do so here, we find that the appellant's December 4, 2009 summary rating of record of "fully successful" was the appellant's final rating of record for the period December 7, 2008, to September 30, 2009. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant was rated as fully successful for the period December 7, 2008, until her removal on September 30, 2009, restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> required that the agency certify her promotion to GS-11 Prosthetics Representative, effective December 6, 2009.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the appellant was eligible to apply for a higher-graded position does not establish a clear entitlement to promotion upon reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 50 MSPR 686, 697 (1991). But an employee restored to the same grade that he held prior to adverse action may effectively be constructively demoted. When an employee was restored to duty, an agency could not undermine one intervening result of the restoration--enhanced responsibilities of the job leading to a noncompetitive promotion through reclassification--by reassigning the employee to a position that was not upgraded through reclassification. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 43 MSPR 221, 225-26 (1990), rejected the agency's argument that the appellant would have been rotated out of her job even if the agency did not effect a wrongful personnel action (citing <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 698, 711 (1981)). The Board was confronted with what it considered a valid intervening claim for advancement arising from a RIF successfully challenged by the appellant in <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 545, 558 (1993). The facts were complex, but the result, simplified, was not: if the position held by the appellant before a RIF is upgraded without a significant change in duties, the appellant should be restored to the upgraded position following his successful RIF appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Army</span>, 90 MSPR 136, 145-46 &#x00B6; 21 (2001) (employee was entitled to a promotion when, during a period of separation, his position was upgraded from GS-10 to GS-10/11). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-073.html#sec6-73">Constructive Demotion Through Reassignment; <span class="Italic">Russell</span></a>"; refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-213.html#sec16-211">Promotion, Placement Consideration; Priority Consideration</a>" concerning settlement agreements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit required some relief as to interim promotional opportunities in <span class="Italic">Drake v. Dept. of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 84-1632). The agency subjected the appellant to a RIF and improperly retained another employee. The appellant had a temporary appointment that expired during the pendency of the appeal. The employee who was improperly retained had a temporary appointment and, during the period of the RIF appeal, succeeded in obtaining a permanent position through merit promotion procedures. Although the appellant was improperly subjected to a RIF, the Board refused to provide relief through interim promotion. The court reversed on the compliance issue, deciding that the Board was required to order the agency to permit the appellant both to compete retroactively for the position the favored employee obtained and to compete for any position he might properly have applied and competed for during the period of the RIF appeal through the date his temporary appointment expired. The court also concluded that an employee may be reinstated at a higher grade if he can clearly establish that he would in fact have been promoted. If a removal penalty is mitigated; the probability of that occurring will encompass the effect of any suspension that the employee receives at the direction of the Board. <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3531) (citing <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d 258 (Ct. Cl. 1979), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit favored consideration of interim promotion as part of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> restoration remedy when the bar to the promotion was some training that the employee would have received had the removal not occurred, <span class="Italic">Maysonet v. DHHS</span>, 82 Fed. Appx. 675, 677-78 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court will set aside a decision of the Board if it finds the decision arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, or not supported by substantial evidence<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). In reinstating a wrongfully terminated person, an agency must restore the person to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante,</span> i.e. to the position the party would have obtained but for the wrongful action<span class="Italic">. See Wainwright v. DHHS</span>, 28 Fed. Appx. 952, 954, 2002 WL 42890 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The agency must reinstate an individual at a higher level if the alleged promotion was mandated by law or if the individual can "clearly establish" that he or she would, in fact, have been promoted<span class="Italic">. Naekel v. Dept. of Trans.</span>, 850 F.2d 682, 683-84 (Fed. Cir. 1988). On the other hand, even if the promotions are routine career-ladder advancements, the Board may still deny such promotions if the agency offers a good reason for not advancing the employee<span class="Italic">. See Rickels v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 596, 602-03 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that Ms. Maysonet did not show that she would have been promoted because she had not completed all of the required training before her removal. The Board acknowledged that Ms. Maysonet has received only good performance ratings, both before and after the wrongful termination, and essentially accepted as fact her assertion that every employee who started with her had received promotions. Although the record contains no evidence to show any deficient performance from Ms. Maysonet at any time, the Board denied the petition under the following reasoning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As asserted by the agency here, the record shows that the appellant did not complete all of the training requirements for her law enforcement officer position prior to her removal.... I find the mere fact that the appellant retroactively served the necessary time in grade to be eligible for promotion does not establish that she would have been promoted but for the unwarranted personnel action. Thus, notwithstanding her prior and recent good performance, I find the appellant is not similarly situated to those employees <span id="Page_4899"></span>who completed the training requirements and have since been promoted. I, therefore, find that the appellant is not entitled to promotion or to have her back pay award calculated at the higher rate of pay for the GS-9 and GS-11 grade level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence does not support this conclusion. The record shows only one reason that Ms. Maysonet had not completed the final training phases, namely, the wrongful removal prevented her from doing so. Although Ms. Maysonet has not shown when she would have completed all the required training, nothing in the record indicates that Ms. Maysonet would have failed to successfully complete all training requirements if she had not been removed. To the contrary, the record supports only the conclusion that she would have successfully completed all required training but for the wrongful termination. Even absent her unsubstantiated allegation that she has now successfully completed all training requirements, the record shows, without dispute, that she displayed only good performance before the removal and after the reinstatement. The only argument presented to support the agency's allegation that Ms. Maysonet would not have been promoted was her lack of complete training, which was wholly caused by the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case turns on whether Ms. Maysonet can clearly show that her requested promotions were simply routine promotions that she would have received but for the removal. If she has made that showing, the agency can only deny the promotions if it can provide a good reason. The record supplies no good reason for the agency to deny the promotions in this case. The only reason Ms. Maysonet lacked the full training upon reinstatement was because she was terminated before to the dates scheduled for her training. In other words, the lack of training was a direct result of the wrongful termination and does not constitute a good reason to deny the promotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question remains, however, whether Ms. Maysonet has clearly established (1) that she would have received the promotions absent the wrongful action, and, if so, (2) when she would have completed the requirements for such promotions. On this record, that determination cannot be made. Although Ms. Maysonet alleges that all others similarly situated have received the requested promotions, the record evidence is lacking to substantiate that allegation. The Government does not dispute this fact or present evidence to the contrary, but merely points out that the evidence in the record does not support it. Although the Board's decision seems to simply accept this allegation as fact, the record must support that assertion. Also lacking is a factual determination of when Ms. Maysonet would have completed her training and qualified for the promotions requested. If the Board determines that Ms. Maysonet is entitled to the promotions, the Board will be required to determine when each promotion level would have applied to increase the level of back pay she is entitled to.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, this court vacates the Board's decision and remands the case for the Board's further factual examination of whether all other employees similarly situated to Ms. Maysonet received the GS-9 and GS-11 promotions according to her allegations, and, if such is the case, when Ms. Maysonet would have finished her required training and been eligible for each promotion. Because this court has found the agency lacks a good reason for denying a routine promotion, the Board needs only address that narrow factual inquiry.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As corrective action in a whistleblowing reprisal IRA case, the Board directed the agency to impartially determine through a review panel the qualifications for noncompetitive promotion of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Rios v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, NY-1221-10-0261-B-1 (NP 12/8/2014). [<span class="Italic">Rios</span> is discussed in Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-08-411.html#sec1-405">Remedies</a>."] But the burden of proof was not varied for whistleblowers who assert that without reprisal they would have been promoted during the time they were termination prior to reinstatement, <span class="Italic">MacLean v. DHS</span>, 754 Fed. Appx. 950, 953-94 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Mr. MacLean argues that the MSPB erred as a matter of law in denying his request for a retroactive promotion. The MSPB determined that Mr. MacLean failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that he was entitled to such promotion. According to the MSPB, the evidence shows that FAMs do not advance to supervisory positions as a matter of course and that promotions to supervisory FAM positions are competitive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Mr. MacLean acknowledges, "[t]he law is well established that 'if the employee could clearly establish that he would in fact have been promoted,' then the agency would 'be required to reinstate him at that higher level.'" Pet'r's Br. 23 (citing <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). Indeed, Mr. MacLean does not challenge the MSPB's decision as to factual issues. Rather, he asserts that, as a <span class="Italic">legal</span> matter, this court should reject and overrule its precedent requiring reinstated whistleblowers to "clearly establish" an entitlement to promotion.[4] In Mr. MacLean's view, a reinstated whistleblower should only need to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would have been promoted had he not been wrongfully removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Boese</span>, 784 F.2d at 390 ("Only if some provision of law mandates a promotion during the interim period, or perhaps if the employee could 'clearly establish' that he would in fact have been promoted, would the agency be required to reinstate him at that higher level."); <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 850 F.2d 682, 684 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (noting that "[retroactive] promotion...[is] inappropriate if the employee would have been only one of several qualified candidates for the promotion, but the factual record did not clearly establish that the employee would have been selected for promotion").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This panel, however, does not have the authority to grant Mr. MacLean the relief that he desires. A panel cannot simply overrule its precedent. <span class="Italic">George E. Warren Corp. v. United States</span>, 341 F.3d 1348, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2003). To overrule a precedent, the court must rule <span class="Italic">en banc</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although there may be no entitlement to interim promotions for those employees whose adverse actions are reversed or mitigated, the situation is different for employees who obtain reinstatement following injury or illness qualifying for workers' compensation. Under 5 USC 8151(b)(1) and 5 CFR 353.106(c) (2022), the employee who is restored is to be considered for those promotions that he would have been considered for had he not been absent. <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 166, 176 (1990). [Refer to Chapter 14, "<a href="0100-2023-21-201.html#sec14-201">Restoration Rights Upon Recovery From Occupational Injury or Illness</a>," concerning restoration of injured employees.] But even when an employee was selected for a promotion but never served in it because he was separated shortly after the selection, he may not be entitled to the interim promotion if he did not enter into duty in the higher-level position and, for that reason, the promotion did not become effective. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hetrick v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 39 MSPR 426, 430 (1989) (an OWCP restoration case).

<p class="Body-Text">As to step increases, the appellant is entitled to the WIGI if his prior ineligibility resulted from the agency-imposed absence from the work site following a removal later reversed by the Board. If the reason for the deferral or denial of the increase relates to performance or attendance while on the rolls, the AJ will need to analyze the agency position if the basis for denial of the WIGI is controverted by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Dwyer v.
