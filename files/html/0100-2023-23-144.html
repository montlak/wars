<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board's regulations do not state that discovery is available to assist in enforcement proceedings, its use should be favored when technical information is needed to resolve compliance problems.

DHUD</span>, 63 MSPR 649, 663-64 (1994) (AJ erred by refusing discovery of the officials who supplied information about the appellant in an alleged violation of a settlement agreement; AJ failed to explain how discovery depositions would not likely lead to relevant information on the subject of breach). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Suggs v. VA</span>, SF-0752-09-0734-X-1 (NP 11/20/2013) ("To the extent the appellant is attempting to pursue discovery against the agency, the Board's regulations provide no avenue for him to do so as part of this compliance review proceeding.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4985"></span>In earlier decisions, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 114, 117 (1990), determined that there is no regulatory right of discovery in enforcement cases; discovery is granted at the discretion of the adjudicator. <span class="Italic">Williams</span> noted that the Board may require "production of evidence," and the case was remanded for the agency to produce records pertinent to the overtime dispute. <span class="Italic">Fredendall v. VA</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 371-72 (1988), omitted the word "discovery," instead stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for enforcement...the administrative judge should review the settlement agreement and the evidence and arguments of the parties in order to determine whether the respective parties are in compliance with the agreement. The Board acknowledges that the agency in this case has greater resources, expertise, and access to disputed records than does the appellant. Thus, the Board expects the agency in this case, and in all enforcement proceedings of a settlement agreement, to produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance with the agreement upon the request of the appellant. The ultimate burden, however, is on the appellant here, as the party seeking enforcement, to show that the agency has failed to fulfill the terms of the agreement. Accordingly, on remand in the instant case, the chief administrative judge shall require the appellant to carry the burden of proving her contentions of agency noncompliance with the settlement agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to discovery, the Board accords broad discretion to its presiding officials in discovery matters. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41. Absent a showing of abuse of such discretion, the Board will not substitute its judgment for that of the presiding official with respect to discovery. <span class="Italic">See Esparza v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force,</span> 22 MSPR 186, 188 (1984). Here, appellants have not shown any such abuse by the presiding official. The agency made the pertinent records, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, its computerized record on which it made its back pay calculations, available to appellants. As the presiding official found, appellants' discovery request was unduly burdensome and because the agency had already provided them with the print-outs generated from the requested payroll data, it was unlikely that granting appellants' request would produce evidence not already made available to appellants, albeit in a different form. Therefore, the appellants were not prejudiced by any rulings of the presiding official even if in error<span class="Italic">. Esparza, supra; Karapinka v. Department of Energy,</span> 6 MSPB 114, 6 MSPR 124 (1981).</p>

Cir. 2015), recognizing ambiguity in Board discovery regulations as they may apply to enforcement proceedings, determined that an AJ improperly failed to act on the appellant's requests to the AJ for discovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Bernard twice asked for discovery, but the administrative judge never acted on those requests, and he denied the enforcement petition without receiving evidence Mr. Bernard might have gathered in the discovery he requested. In affirming the denial of enforcement, the Board did not conclude, and the agency here does not contend, that in an enforcement proceeding like this one the Board may deny a complainant like Mr. Bernard all discovery, including discovery of potentially relevant evidence, even if sought through the proper channels. Rather, the Board concluded, and the agency argues, that Mr. Bernard clearly had, but simply bypassed, the opportunity to obtain discovery. In the Board's view, Mr. Bernard could have directly asked individuals to sit for depositions, or to respond to other discovery requests, and, if he met resistance, moved to compel the requested discovery. But the Board had no sound foundation, in general regulations, Board precedents, or case-specific orders, for its conclusion that it was permissible for the administrative judge to disregard Mr. Bernard's clear requests for discovery. Mr. Bernard did not have a clear right to engage directly in discovery without obtaining permission before the administrative judge made his agreement-compliance decision under the enforcement procedures, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No regulation makes clear that Mr. Bernard could proceed directly to take discovery, without permission from the administrative judge, before the administrative judge rendered his initial decision on the agency's compliance. The discovery regulations cited by the Board, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.71-1201.75, appear in subpart B of 5 C.F.R. pt. 1201, covering "appellate cases," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.11-1201.113. That subpart is distinct from subpart F governing "Enforcement of Final Decisions and Orders," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.181-1201.183, under which the present enforcement proceeding was brought. It is anything but clear that the former is applicable to the latter. Indeed, the opposite is suggested by the mismatch between the rules for discovery under &#x00A7; 1201.73, including timing rules that allow 20 days for response to a discovery request, &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(2), and the much tighter schedule prescribed for enforcement proceedings: <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the agency must respond to an enforcement petition within 15 days, and the petitioner has only 10 days to reply before the administrative judge may make a determination of compliance, &#x00A7; 1201.183(a). Thus, the regulations themselves provide no clear guarantee of direct discovery applicable to Mr. Bernard's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do Board precedents interpreting the regulations provide such a clear guarantee. The enforcement proceeding precedent on which the Board relied here does suggest a direct-discovery right, <span class="Italic">King v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 547, 552 (2005) ("a party does not need the Board's approval to engage in discovery"), but <span class="Italic">King</span>'s precise meaning on the facts presented--perhaps involving discovery <span class="Italic">after</span> an initial compliance order under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(5)--is not clear. Moreover, <span class="Italic">King</span>'s only cited legal authority is &#x00A7; 1201.73, which, as we have just noted, appears not to apply to enforcement proceedings. In any event, <span class="Italic">King</span> does not stand alone. In <span class="Italic">Ernst v. Department of Treasury</span>, the Board, following earlier pronouncements, declared: "An employee is not entitled to discovery in enforcement proceedings, although the AJ has the discretion to grant such a request." 69 M.S.P.R. 133, 139 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 92 F.3d 1208 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">see Forston v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 154, 158 (1993); <span class="Italic">Covert v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 376, 382 (1986). The Board in <span class="Italic">King</span> did not address <span class="Italic">Ernst</span> and its predecessors. And since <span class="Italic">King</span>, the Board has repeated the <span class="Italic">Ernst</span> proposition, citing <span class="Italic">Ernst</span> as establishing that, "in an enforcement proceeding, an employee is not entitled to discovery to establish his allegations, although the administrative judge may grant discovery in his discretion, if necessary to resolve disputed facts." <span class="Italic">Young v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Serv.</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 609, 620 (2010). Thus, Board precedent, combined with the regulations, gave Mr. Bernard no genuine notice that he could take discovery in this enforcement proceeding without advance permission from the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also cannot find such notice in any orders issued in Mr. Bernard's case. The government contends that the administrative judge in fact granted discovery by way of an acknowledgment order sent to both parties upon receipt of Mr. Bernard's petition for enforcement. That order does not mention discovery expressly, but it does state that "the procedures and filing requirements set forth in the Order acknowledging [Mr. Bernard's] <span class="Italic">original appeal</span> [the one that was settled] are applicable in this case." The government argues that because the acknowledgement order in the underlying appeal granted discovery, the Enforcement Order's reference to those procedures did the same. But this argument fails to justify the administrative judge's disregard of Mr. Bernard's express discovery requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board itself did not conclude that the Enforcement Order provided the opportunity for discovery. And there is good reason for the Board not to have relied on the reasoning the government now advances. The Enforcement Order does not provide meaningful notice that discovery was being authorized. In referring to the Appeal Order for "procedures and filing requirements," it makes no mention of discovery specifically. And while that omission might not matter if the discovery provisions of the Appeal Order fit the enforcement context, they plainly do not. Most concretely, there is essentially the same timing-rules mismatch we identified above in discussing the regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Enforcement Order provides three clear deadlines: (1) the agency must file its written response to Mr. Bernard's petition "within 15 calendar days"; (2) Mr. Bernard may then file a reply within 10 days of being served with the agency's filing; and (3) the evidentiary record closes the same day Mr. Bernard's reply is due, i.e., "10 calendar days from the date of service of the agency's reply to appellant's petition." That schedule allows 25 days from petition to closure of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Yet the Appeal Order instructed the parties that "initial [discovery] requests...must be <span class="Italic">served</span> on the other party within 25 calendar days of the date of <span class="Italic">this</span> Order," and "[r]esponses to initial discovery requests must be served promptly but no later than 20 days after the date of service of the other party's discovery request or the MSPB order." If we strike out the <span id="Page_4986"></span>phrase "the date of this Order" and replace it with a reference to the date of the <span class="Italic">Enforcement</span> Order, we obtain an order under which the record closed before any response to a discovery request was required. Similar problems arise from trying to apply the Board's discovery regulations for appellate cases, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.71-1201.75, which the Appeal Order designates as the "procedures [to be] used for discovery," and which establish timelines applicable unless the administrative judge instructs otherwise, &#x00A7; 1201.73(d). Under the regulations, parties must serve initial discovery requests "within 30 days after the date on which the judge issues an order to the respondent agency to produce the agency file and response"; the responding party has 20 days to respond to discovery requests; and discovery must be completed "no later than the prehearing or close of record conference."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps it is possible to translate the terms of the regulations and Appeal Order into the enforcement setting. We might even construct a scenario in which Mr. Bernard could have initiated discovery within a few days of filing his petition, even before getting the agency's response to his charge of noncompliance (which would define the actual dispute), then awaited responses within the time allowed under the Appeal Order and regulations, and have had time to digest and use the discovered evidence before his last filing was due and the enforcement record closed under the Enforcement Order. But such an effort to force discovery into the Appeal Order schedule is so strained, and produces a discovery schedule so far from what the Board regulations indicate to be truly adequate, that Mr. Bernard cannot be expected to have understood the Enforcement Order to incorporate the Appeal Order's authorization for discovery in the underlying appeal. It is hardly surprising that the Board did not conclude otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At oral argument, the government did not dispute that the Enforcement Order and Appeal Order deadlines were a mismatch, but it urged that Mr. Bernard should have taken advantage of the Enforcement Order's invitation to the parties to call the judge by phone if they were confused by any of the stated procedures. But Mr. Bernard's clear and explicit discovery requests--in two formal filings to the administrative judge--sufficiently conveyed his belief that discovery was unavailable without an order from the administrative judge. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the Board abused its discretion by holding that the administrative judge was not obliged to respond to Mr. Bernard's requests. <span class="Italic">See Cultor Corp. v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co.</span>, 224 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (a court may abuse its discretion by failing to explain its decision unless "the explanation is apparent" from the record) (citing <span class="Italic">Foman v. Davis</span>, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).</p>
