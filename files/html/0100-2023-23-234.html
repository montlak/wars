<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-201a"><span class="space">a.</span> Foreclosure of Future Discipline or Other Agency Action for Past Conduct</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite its proclivity to avoid creating settlement terms where none exist, the Board can imply a settlement condition that seems logical or necessary to the agreement but that is not directly stated in the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 69 MSPR 627, 629-31 (1996), a settlement resolved an adverse action based on alleged threatening behavior during a meeting. After the settlement, the agency proposed adverse action as a result of alleged disrespectful and abusive conduct arising out of the same meeting. The proposed adverse action violated the first settlement because that settlement necessarily implied that problems arising from the meeting were fully resolved through the settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency imposed a 30-day suspension and a reassignment upon appellant Davis, and removed appellant Moore, for their allegedly threatening behavior during a meeting on July 8, 1994. The parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving those appeals. The agency subsequently proposed a new removal of appellant Moore and a new 30-day suspension of appellant Davis for alleged disrespectful and abusive conduct toward the other agency employees arising out of the same July 8, 1994 meeting which gave rise to the original adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the appellants assert that the proposed adverse actions should be vacated under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. The administrative judge correctly found, however, that the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> was inapplicable because the adjudication of the merits of their appeals had not taken place. <span class="Italic">See Vargo v. US Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 156, 159 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found, however, that the parties' settlement agreement did not preclude the agency from imposing the new actions based on the same underlying misconduct. We reverse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract and the interpretation of its terms is a question of law. <span class="Italic">See Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Mobley v. US Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 467, 474 (1992). In construing the terms of the settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance to determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted. <span class="Italic">Mobley</span>, 55 MSPR at 474. The Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous, and will not hear a party's complaints about matters that were not included in a settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the cases at hand, we find that the parties' settlement agreement specifically provides that it "resolved the issues raised in these appeals." We find implicit within that term an understanding that the settlement agreement resolves "the whole dispute" as to whether the appellants should be disciplined for their conduct of July 8, 1994. <span class="Italic">See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560-61. In the event that a settlement does not resolve all the matters <span id="Page_5153"></span>involved in a dispute, then the parties should not agree to a dismissal with prejudice, as they did herein, without first reserving the unresolved issues or in some way indicating their intent as to such issues. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Young v. Powell</span>, 729 F.2d 563, 567 n.3 (8th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the parties' settlement agreement does not contain any term authorizing the agency to effect new disciplinary actions against the appellants for their conduct of July 8, 1994. Thus, the Board will not imply such a term.[*] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mobley</span>, 55 MSPR at 474.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Moreover, inasmuch as the appellants would have gained little or nothing by an agreement under which the agency merely withdrew the charges and issued new charges--actions that the agency could have unilaterally taken in any event--logic would militate against a finding that the parties intended such a provision<span class="Italic">. See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 561 ("it would be unreasonable to read the agreement in a manner so narrow as to defeat the intent of the parties"); <span class="Italic">Sigler v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 103, 108-09 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board, as a matter of policy, favors the settlement of appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Panther v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 52 MSPR 419, 422 (1992). The settlement of disputes serves to avoid unnecessary litigation and to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. We find that the agency's actions herein are directly opposed to that beneficial policy. We conclude that the agency's attempt to bring the new disciplinary actions based on the appellants' same behavior as was involved in the parties' settlement agreement is void, as violative of the terms of the parties' contract<span class="Italic">. See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560-61.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another settlement that implicitly foreclosed future discipline for problems that were addressed in the settlement arose in <span class="Italic">Zamora v. DOD</span>, 58 MSPR 544, 545 (1993), involving an adverse action for vehicle misuse that led to a last chance settlement agreement providing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By the rescission of the Appellant's removal, the parties intend that the Appellant will be placed back in the position and job responsibilities which he held prior to his removal.... The parties agree that the disciplinary suspension constitutes the appropriate penalty for the charges here, and that the Agency will take no further reprisal against the Appellant for either the charges or the filing of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Zamora alleged the agency breached its agreement by lowering his performance appraisal for the conduct leading to the adverse action. The Board agreed and directed a remedy, 58 MSPR at 546-47:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant asserted that the agency breached the settlement agreement by harassing him in reprisal for his appeal and by relying on one of the charges on which his removal was based--misuse of a Government vehicle--to lower his performance rating from previous years in two critical elements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that the agency breached the settlement agreement. The agency asserts that the administrative judge's interpretation of the term "penalty" as including a lowered performance appraisal should be rejected. However, we find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the term "penalty" as used in the settlement agreement, was intended to bar the agency from further penalizing the appellant for the alleged misconduct which was resolved by the parties in their settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A penalty is "[a]n elastic term with many different shades of meaning: it involves the idea of punishment..." Recommended Decision at 6, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> (1979). Since a performance appraisal that is lowered because of the appellant's alleged misconduct is punitive in nature, it is a penalty within the meaning of the settlement agreement. When the appellant signed the settlement agreement and accepted the suspension, he had a reasonable expectation that he had accepted all the punishment for his misconduct that would be imposed. We therefore find that the agency breached the agreement by lowering the appellant's performance appraisal and thus imposing an unauthorized "penalty" on appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for the agency to be in compliance, the appellant must receive the same ratings he would have received had his misuse of a government vehicle not been considered. The administrative judge effected this remedy by ordering the agency to elevate appellant's rating one level in each of the elements in dispute which would result in a fully successful rating. Because there is sufficient evidence to support the administrative judge's finding and recommendation on this issue, we order the agency to raise the appellant's performance rating to fully successful for Critical Element # 1 and to highly successful for Critical Element # 2.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Humphrey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 42 MSPR 448, 452 (1989), a settlement followed the appellant's removal for physical inability to perform his job. The agreement stated that it was designed to resolve "this appeal" and made mention of appellant's separation for disability. The appellant was restored to duty after the suspension and was then issued a decision sustaining a previously proposed 14-day suspension. The use of the term "reappoint" in the agreement did not prevent the agency from effecting the suspension. The appellant presented no evidence or argument proving that the use of this term precluded the agency from imposing discipline for misconduct wholly unrelated to the subject of the settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chin-Young v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0752-11-0394-C-3 (NP 9/29/2016) ("However, nothing in the settlement agreement precludes the agency from taking a new adverse action based on new alleged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Moody v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 319, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2002).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Tom v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 97 MSPR 395, 399-402 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12 (2004), that resolved a removal through demotion, but that specifically provided for a future determination of the appellant's suitability for her position, did not preclude the agency from taking substantially the same conduct that led to the adverse action culminating in settlement and using that information, after the settlement was signed, to remove the appellant on related suitability-type grounds for misuse of a government credit card:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective October 20, 2000, the agency removed the appellant from her GS-13 Supervisory Accountant position with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Navajo Region based on allegations that she had misused her government credit card. The appellant appealed the removal and, while her appeal was pending, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the appellant admitted guilt as to a single specification of misconduct, but she neither admitted guilt as to any of the other allegations against her nor did the agency concede that she was innocent of the other allegations. The agency agreed to cancel the removal action and demote the appellant to the position of GS-9 Realty Specialist, subject to the successful completion of a background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and a suitability determination by the BIA's Security Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thereafter, as agreed, a background investigation was conducted and the investigation file was assigned to Security Specialist Colleen Florence for adjudication. Ms. Florence reviewed the file and gave the appellant a series of written interrogatories about the contents of the file. After receiving and reviewing the appellant's response to the interrogatories, Ms. Florence determined that the appellant was unsuitable for continued employment as a Realty Specialist because her prior misconduct, namely, the credit card misuse underlying the settled removal action, created doubt about her judgment, reliability, and credibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Navajo Deputy Regional Director Omar Bradley then proposed the appellant's removal based on a charge of "failure to obtain the required security clearance for your position" based on the negative suitability determination issued by Ms. Florence. After considering the appellant's oral reply to the proposed removal, Navajo Regional Director Thomas Hemstreet removed the appellant effective June 14, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed her removal and contended, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency committed harmful error in the following respects: the agency lacked delegated authority from OPM to make suitability determinations; the agency violated its internal rules concerning the assignment of proposing and deciding officials when it designated Mr. Bradley and Mr. Hemstreet to perform those roles in her case; the settlement agreement precluded consideration of the alleged credit card misuse charged in the October 2000 removal; and the agency failed to afford her notice and an opportunity to respond before finding her unsuitable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After affording the appellant her requested hearing, the administrative judge (AJ) reversed the removal action. In so doing, he found that the agency was not precluded by the settlement agreement from relying on the allegations of credit card misuse in finding the appellant unsuitable for the Realty Specialist position. He also found that the agency failed to prove that the appellant's credit card misuse was serious enough to warrant finding her unsuitable for her position. In light of his disposition of the appeal, he did not consider the appellant's harmful error claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has petitioned for review, asserting that the AJ erred by finding that it had not proven that the appellant was unsuitable for employment as a Realty Specialist. The appellant has cross petitioned for review, contending that the AJ erred by finding that the instant removal was not precluded by the earlier settlement agreement. The appellant also reiterates the following allegations of harmful error: Ms. Florence lacked the authority to make a negative suitability determination; the agency violated its internal rules concerning the assignment of proposing and deciding officials; and the agency violated the suitability procedures set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 731 and the adverse action regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 752.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The instant removal action is not precluded by the settlement agreement</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, an agency may not discipline an employee twice for the same misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Eichner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 202 &#x00B6; 17 (1999). In cases governed by a settlement agreement and which appear to involve possible multiple acts of discipline for the same misconduct, the threshold question is whether the second act of discipline is precluded by the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 627, 631 (1996). The appellant contends in her cross petition for review that the settlement agreement in this case does not specifically <span id="Page_5154"></span>provide that the agency may bring a new adverse action based on the same conduct at issue in the earlier removal action and, therefore, the AJ erred by finding that the instant removal action was not precluded by the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Donahue v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 488 &#x00B6; 12 (2003). In construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time they contracted. <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560; <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 630. The Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous and will not hear a party's complaints about matters that were not included in a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 630; <span class="Italic">Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 467, 474 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The operative provisions of the settlement agreement in question are paragraphs 5 and 6. In paragraph 5, the parties agreed as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By signing below the Appellant understands that the position of Realty Specialist, GS-1170-09 requires a Background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management and a clearance/suitability determination by the BIA Security Office. The Appellant agrees to undergo the regular Security Clearance procedures required by the Agency for the position. This includes completion and submission of the required Security forms and releases of information upon the day of return to duty. The Agency agrees to supply these forms in advance to the Appellant for her completion. The Agency agrees to pay for the expedited 30 day processing by [OPM].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph 6 contains a confidentiality clause which provides that the terms and conditions of the agreement will not be disclosed to any third party "other than counsel or representative or Government officials with a legitimate need to know." The agreement further provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">All parties agree that they will not publicize this case (including the file and settlement agreement) in any manner, written or oral, nor discuss the specifics of the settlement agreement negotiations with persons without a legitimate need to know.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ correctly noted, paragraph 5 explicitly provides that the appellant's demotion to the Realty Specialist position was subject to her successful completion of a background investigation and the adjudication of her suitability by the BIA Security Office. Furthermore, paragraph 6 explicitly permits the disclosure of the settlement agreement, along with the events underlying the settlement agreement, to Government officials with a "legitimate need to know." The agreement does not provide for the expungement of either the canceled removal action or the allegations of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Cf. Sweeney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 159 F.3d 1342, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (where the acts that were the basis for a suspension were expunged from the appellant's record in accordance with a settlement agreement, the agency could not rely on the same acts to remove the appellant). In fact, the appellant admitted in the agreement to one instance of misconduct, and agreed that her demotion would be for cause and that the SF-50 would reflect that the action was taken for misuse of a government credit card.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we see no ambiguity in the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goldstine v. Department of the Navy</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 602, 606 (1991) (silence in a contract does not necessarily create an ambiguity). Because she admitted to credit card misuse, consented to a demotion for credit card misuse, and bargained for non-disclosure except to persons with a "legitimate need to know," the appellant's argument that she expected that all allegations of misconduct would be concealed from the background investigator and BIA Security Office is unreasonable and implausible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Donahue</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 488 &#x00B6; 12 (the Board will give a reasonable interpretation to the terms of the agreement to carry out the parties' intentions and to avoid absurd results). Nothing in the terms of the agreement prohibits the agency from disclosing the appellant's misconduct to the background investigator or the BIA Security Office. Indeed, because those officials had a "legitimate need to know" about the appellant's misconduct in order to properly conduct a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> background investigation and suitability adjudication, we find that disclosure of the appellant's misconduct to those officials is contemplated by the settlement agreement. Further, the appellant agreed to be bound by the outcome of the suitability adjudication, whatever that outcome may be. <span class="Italic">See Kellihan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 47, 50 (1996) (a party is entitled to no more than is provided for by the terms of a settlement agreement). Faced with credible evidence that the appellant had repeatedly misused her government credit card, the agency could not have legitimately agreed to place her in the Realty Specialist position with no determination made about her suitability. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gizzarelli v. Department of the Army</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 269 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (2001) (persons applying for positions of public trust are subject to background checks, and public policy favors the disclosure of background information to OPM as part of a background investigation). We find, therefore, that the AJ correctly found that the agreement did not preclude the instant removal action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Sweeney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 149 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (the fact that the agency was contemplating carrying out a removal that it had already formally proposed when it was negotiating the settlement in a suspension appeal does not make the resulting settlement agreement invalid).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board views settlement enforcement with a measure of common sense and equity. <span class="Italic">Sigler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 103, 108-09 (1994), interpreting a last chance agreement in a manner consistent with the language and intent of the parties, provided the appellant with a period of probation to demonstrate acceptable attendance without having past problems held against her:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We note that all of these instances of attendance-related misconduct had already occurred when the parties entered into the settlement agreement. However, there is no evidence in the record that they were the subject of pending disciplinary proceedings at the time the parties entered into the settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant part of the agreement provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The [appellant] agrees to make a good faith effort to maintain satisfactory punctuality, attendance and conduct for a one-year probationary period beginning on the date of signing of this agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">9.&#x2003;The agency agrees to hold in abeyance all pending disciplinary action until such time as [the appellanT]has successfully completed the one-year probationary period, or has violated the terms of this agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When read together, these provisions show that the clear intent of the parties was that the appellant be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate satisfactory attendance for a period of one year, commencing with the signing of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that it would be contrary to the intent of the parties to permit the agency to bring a disciplinary action against the appellant based on her pre-agreement absences, without a showing that she violated the agreement. The agency has made no such showing here. The only instance of post-agreement misconduct alleged by the agency to be a breach of the agreement was the charge of AWOL on November 4, 1991, which we found not sustained. Accordingly, because the agency has failed to establish that the appellant breached the settlement agreement, we find that these charges cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit implied, but left the Board to resolve on remand, the possible foreclosure of a future penalty following a settlement that purportedly fully resolved an appealed disciplinary action, <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. USPS</span>, 159 F.3d 1342, 1343-44 (Fed. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sweeney was suspended indefinitely by the Postal Service on February 25, 1997 by notice dated February 26, based on specified charges. On March 11, 1997 he filed an appeal with the Board. On April 21, 1997 the Postal Service issued a Notice of Proposed Removal, reciting the incident on which he had been suspended. On June 26, 1997 Mr. Sweeney and the Postal Service entered into a written settlement agreement, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;This agreement shall not serve as a precedent for resolving any other complaints.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;It is understood by the parties that this Agreement is in full and complete settlement of all EEO complaints or appeals, in this or any other forum, filed by the appellant or on his behalf relating to this matter. The Settlement resolves all the issues related to Appellant's Merit Systems Protection Board Appeal, Docket No. CH-0752-97-0390-I-1, and Appellant withdraws his MSPB appeal. It is understood that in withdrawing all appeals and complaints, appellant waives his right to an oral hearing or further appeal on the matters raised. It is further stipulated that such withdrawals are made without threat, coercion, intimidation, promise, or inducement other than the terms set forth in the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;It is agreed that the notice of emergency off duty placement dated 2/26/97 is expunged from Appellant's record and he shall be paid backpay from 2/25/97 through 3/10/97.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement was signed on June 25, 1997 by Mr. Sweeney and his designated representative, Velma Chism; and on June 26, 1997 by Elaine Dombin, the Postal Service's representative. It was promptly sent to the Board for entry. A letter from the Postal Service dated June 27, 1997, referring to the Notice of Proposed Removal, informed Mr. Sweeney that he was removed from the Postal Service, effective July 2, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 30, 1997 the administrative judge (AJ) issued an order determining that the settlement agreement was lawful and freely made, and entered it into the record for enforcement purposes. The AJ then dismissed Mr. Sweeney's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 25, 1997 Mr. Sweeney petitioned the Board to review the AJ's June 30, 1997 order, stating "I have been fired after this was expunged from my record." Mr. Sweeney stated that the settlement "was the result of fraud," and asked to "reopen" his case and to be returned to work. The <span id="Page_5155"></span>Board denied the petition, suggesting that if the agency's action was "a subsequent action," it required a separate appeal to the Board. The Board gave 30 days for filing a new appeal. Mr. Sweeney appeals the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sweeney, in his appeal to this court, expresses general concern and dismay as to the procedures followed and actions taken. He stresses that his removal was on the same grounds that had been, by the settlement agreement, expunged from his record. He states that the agreement by its terms settled all issues related to his appeal, and required him to withdraw all appeals and complaints on these matters. Mr. Sweeney states: "The agreement was supposed to be in good faith by order of the Judge, but it was not. Two days after the agreement was signed, June 25, 1997, I was discharged."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's only response is that Mr. Sweeney was required to file a separate appeal, and that it is now too late for him to do so. Mr. Sweeney disputes the assertion that he should have filed another appeal. He points to the settlement agreement, wherein he agreed that he would file "no further appeals on the matters raised." He suggests that the settlement was a "fraud," and that he was misled and deceived into the belief that it was the "full and complete settlement" it announced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties<span class="Italic">. Mahboob v. Department of Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126, 1128 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In accordance with principles of contract law, an implied term of every settlement agreement is that the parties deal in good faith with each other. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 130 F.3d at 1033-34; <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">McCall v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Although settlement agreements in which employees voluntarily waive their right of appeal are permissible, if an agency acts in bad faith it has breached the agreement. <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 667; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">King</span>, 130 F.3d at 1033-34 (as a breaching party the agency can not enforce the agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not know the true basis of the agency's action. However, on its face the action is not one that a reasonable observer of the "full and complete settlement" language would view as including only the pending suspension and excluding the pending proposed removal on the same grounds. The settlement agreement was entered into while both the suspension and proposed removal were pending, and "resolve[d] all the issues related to" Mr. Sweeney's appeal, requiring Mr. Sweeney to waive his right to an oral hearing or further appeal "on the matters raised." The acts that were the basis for the suspension were by the agreement expunged from his record. Thus if the removal was not part of the settlement, the grounds of the removal were expunged before that action was taken, one day following the agency's execution of the agreement and its submission to the Board. The scope of the agreement and the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the agency actions were squarely placed at issue in Mr. Sweeney's petition to the full Board. It was inappropriate for the Board to require him to start again in an entirely separate appeal, when the actions complained of relate directly to the settlement of the case that was before the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Board determined that Mr. Sweeney's settlement did not foreclose the removal action, <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 149, 152-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that a settlement agreement is invalid, a party must show that the agreement is unlawful, or that it was the result of fraud, coercion, or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Jardine v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 544, 547 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Asberry v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Further, a party may establish a breach of the agreement by showing that the other party acted in bad faith with respect to a term of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 323 (1995). The Board has defined "bad faith" as "the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obloquy." <span class="Italic">Adams v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 6, 11 (1996). Here, the appellant alleges that the settlement agreement was obtained by fraud, and that it was the product of the agency's bad faith, because the agency removed him for the same conduct that was expunged from his record under the terms of the settlement agreement. We find that these allegations lack merit because the settlement agreement did not obligate the agency to rescind the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the Board considers the words of the agreement itself to be of paramount importance. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 225, 229 (1997); <span class="Italic">Birdsong v. Department of the Navy,</span> 75 MSPR 524, 528 (1997) (absent ambiguity, the plain meaning of the terms of a settlement agreement will control). Here, the settlement agreement expressly referred to the appellant's Board appeal of his emergency placement on off-duty suspension, i.e., "the notice of emergency off-duty placement dated 2/25/97 is expunged from the appellant's record...." It did not, however, make any reference to the notice of proposed removal. Further, although the agency agreed to provide the appellant with back pay for the period of his suspension, and to expunge the suspension from his record, there is nothing in the settlement agreement to suggest that the agency excused the appellant's conduct, or that it concluded that it did not warrant discipline. <span class="Italic">See Kellihan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 72 MSPR 47, 50 (1996) (a party is entitled to no more than what is provided for in the settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Coon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 62 MSPR 180, 184 (1994) (the Board will not interpret the language of a settlement agreement in a way that unilaterally modifies the agreement); <span class="Italic">Putnam v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 44 MSPR 533, 535 (1990) (the Board will not read into a settlement agreement a term that the parties did not intend).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency was not obligated, under the terms of the settlement agreement, to rescind the notice of proposed removal, the appellant has not shown that it acted fraudulently or in bad faith. The fact that the agency was contemplating carrying out a removal that it had already formally proposed when it was negotiating the settlement in the suspension appeal does not make the resulting settlement agreement invalid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Melton v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0752-09-0448-C-1 (NP 6/18/2015), the agency violated a settlement when it pursued debt collection against an employee for health insurance expense incurred while she was on LWOP. The agreement provided that it is "in full and final settlement of all issues involving the employment and resignation of [the appellant]...as well as any other matters related to [her] employment with the [agency]."<span id="Page_5156"></span></p> </section>
