<h3 class="h3" id="sec13-154"><span class="space">E.</span> REMEDIES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Remedies are addressed in Chapter 16, including compensatory and consequential damages for whistleblowing reprisal. Discussed in the sections that follow are cases involving OSC corrective and disciplinary actions and stay requests. We note here a few cases involving appellate relief designed to undo particular personnel actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Miller v. VA</span>, 92 MSPR 610, 621-22 &#x00B6; 24 (2002), if the appellant establishes that an action is motivated by reprisal, the entire action (and associated penalty) is to be canceled, even if the Board would otherwise find some action would be appropriate were there no reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B) provides that if, as here, the agency proves the charged misconduct by preponderant evidence, "the agency's decision may not be sustained...if the employee...shows that the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) of [Title 5]." Reprisal for whistleblowing activity is prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Because the agency did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have brought the actions against the appellants absent their protected disclosures, the statute requires that the actions be cancelled. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Arauz v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529 &#x00B6; 12 (2001) ("[w]hen a protected disclosure is found to have been a contributing factor in a personnel action appealed to the Board, the Board will not sustain the action unless the agency presents clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of the disclosure"); <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Department of the</span> Interior, 76 M.S.P.R. 363, 370-72 (1997) (because the agency did not show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have given the appellant the same performance evaluation absent his protected disclosures, he was entitled to a corrected evaluation); <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 326-28 (because the agency did not show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have demoted the appellant absent his protected disclosures under the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Board "[had] no choice but to order corrective action" by ordering the agency to cancel the appellant's demotion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Siler v. EPA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20181113116">908 F.3d 1291</a>, 1298-99 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ("The Board has no discretion to affirm a penalty tainted by illegal reprisal, even if the agency's penalty might otherwise have been reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Nies, J., concurring) ('In an adverse action proceeding,.... the merits cannot be the determinative factor that there was no reprisal. A <span class="Italic">meritorious adverse action must be set aside where there is reprisal</span>.' (emphasis added)).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Armstrong v. DOJ</span>, 107 MSPR 375, 380-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 34-35, 2007 MSPB 280 (2007) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 2022 MSPB 9 (2022)), noted the relief available to an employee who, after engaging in whistleblowing, transferred to another agency but complained that during his earlier employment he was denied a promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal is entitled to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief that includes: cancellation of the retaliatory personnel action; the appellant's reinstatement to his former position or to another substantially equivalent position, as appropriate; back pay; interest on back pay; and other employment benefits that he would have received had the action not occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 238, &#x00B6; 5. As previously discussed, the appellant is not entitled to reinstatement, as he left the agency voluntarily. However, we find that he is entitled to retroactive promotion to a GS-13 Program Analyst position, beginning October 1, 2003, and terminating with the date of his departure from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, under the 1994 amendments to the WPA, an appellant who prevails on an allegation of reprisal for protected whistleblowing is entitled to additional relief, including medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonably foreseeable consequential damages. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Walton v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 401, 403 (1998).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sooter v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> CH-1221-12-0588-W-1 (NP 4/2/2015), remanded for consideration of the relief appropriate for an employee terminated shortly before her temporary appointment expired:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal is entitled to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief that includes the following: cancellation of the retaliatory personnel action; reinstatement to her former position or to another substantially equivalent position, as appropriate; back pay; interest on back pay; and other employment benefits that she would have received had the action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Schnell</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 25. The appellant who prevails is also eligible for relief that exceeds the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, including medical costs incurred, travel expenses, other reasonably foreseeable consequential damages, and may request disciplinary action be imposed against agency officials who engaged in retaliatory conduct. <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 23 (2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(b). Our reviewing court has determined that the term "consequential damages" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g) is limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs to make an individual whole for an improper personnel action but does not include nonpecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Bohac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The administrative judge determined that the appellant's request for consequential damages should be addressed in an addendum proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted in the initial decision, the appellant was hired under a temporary appointment that was followed by a series of extensions and additional temporary appointments for over a year before her termination. Though the appellant had less than 1 month remaining on her temporary appointment at the time of her termination, the appellant seeks damages through the remainder of the operation of the Lexington, Kentucky Census Bureau office. The record does not reflect whether the Lexington, Kentucky office is still in operation or when it closed. As such, the record is not sufficiently developed as to the appropriate corrective action to order and the appeal must be remanded for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">Schnell</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the parties should be given the opportunity to present additional evidence and argument as to whether the appellant's temporary position would have been extended and for how long a period of time for the Board to order the appropriate corrective action. The administrative judge may incorporate her prior findings that we have adopted into a new initial decision that also addresses the length of her temporary employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 402, 413 (1993) (undoing related personnel actions: "[r]eversal of the reassignment here thus appears to require the appellant's return to his old position as Housing Manager and reversal of his separation, after reassignment, for disability in the position of Budget Analyst"; <span class="Italic">Kagel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 126 F.3d 1455, 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("If Kagel is able to prove that the threat to remove him violates the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Board could fashion a remedy consistent with that statutory authority by, for example, directing that the agency not remove him or threaten to remove him for the reasons given in the August 10 directive, <span id="Page_3924"></span>even if Ms. Kagel resumes her activities within the Walla Walla district."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Guy v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-1221-10-0115-C-1 (NP 4/17/2012) ("The theory behind an individual right of action (IRA) appeal is that the agency took a personnel action because of the appellant's whistleblowing activity, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(a), and corrective action, when ordered, pertains to that personnel action, not to the protected disclosure. Therefore, we find that the appellant has not shown error in the administrative judge's finding that the agency was not required, by her order, to delete the language in the performance evaluation that referred to the underlying basis for the appellant's reprimand since that action was not a personnel action that she found was taken because of his protected whistleblowing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rios v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, NY-1221-10-0261-B-1 (NP 12/8/2014), unfortunately nonprecedential, addressed the claim that a whistleblower whose performance appraisal was evaluated at reduced level as a reprisal was entitled to consideration for a noncompetitive promotion based on an impartial review that excluded his normal chain of command, that is, excluded people involved in the earlier retaliatory activity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not clear whether the appellant would have been promoted but for his protected whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Morgan</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 14. The promotion was noncompetitive and his application never received fair consideration. Even absent consideration of the appellant's whistleblowing, the agency may or may not have promoted the appellant after an honest assessment of his skills and abilities, particularly his ability to manage the most complex criminal investigations. Therefore, we do not agree that the appellant is entitled to a promotion at this point and agree with the administrative judge that the proper remedy in this case is for the agency to give the appellant's application for promotion fair and objective review based on merit factors and not on prohibited factors, and to award the appellant a retroactive promotion with back pay if the record shows that the agency would have promoted the appellant absent his whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant naturally has concerns as to whether his application can receive objective consideration at the agency, and he asserts that the administrative judge's order places his application for promotion in front of the same agency managers who retaliated against him in the first place. We acknowledge the appellant's concerns and note that the first- and second-level supervisors who retaliated against the appellant are now his second- and third-level supervisors. Indeed, the appellant's former second-level supervisor is now the Special Agent in Charge of the Southeast Division and every employee of the Southeast Division ultimately is under his supervision and managerial control. While it is not appropriate to interfere in the agency's substantive decision concerning the appellant's qualifications, we find that it is appropriate to afford the appellant as nearly as practicable the same review process applicable to other candidates, but with limitations as to who may participate in the review process in order to minimize the intentional or unintentional introduction of bias into the process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We ORDER the agency to modify the appellant's 2009 performance rating such that he receives the same rating as he did for performance year 2008. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The agency shall then award the appellant a retroactive pay increase consistent with the pay increase that other Special Agents in pay band III with similar rating scores received in 2009, along with any other pay increases after 2009 that would have been affected by the 2009 pay increase.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also ORDER the agency to convene a National Review Panel of seven members, consistent with OLE National Directive No. 165, Special Agents Promotions from ZA-III to ZA-IV, and review the appellant's application for promotion to pay band IV on its merits, without consideration of any improper factors. The agency shall follow the process set forth in OLE National Directive No. 165 subject to the following modifications. We ORDER that no one with any direct knowledge of this case, no one in the appellant's chain of command from April 2009 through the date of this Order, and no current employee of the Southeast Division shall participate in any way in the consideration of the appellant's application, with the exception of the current OLE Director. If the agency determines that the appellant meets the criteria for promotion, it shall promote him retroactive to the date on which the other successful candidates for promotion in December 2009 were promoted. In any event, the agency shall make a written report of the panel's findings as to whether the appellant meets the criteria for promotion.</p>
