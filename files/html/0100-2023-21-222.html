<p class="Body-Text">Reduction of hours of a limited duty assignment below the hours that the appellant is cleared to work may constitute an arbitrary or capricious denial of restoration rights, depending on other available work, <span class="Italic">Scott v. USPS</span>, 118 MSPR 375, 380-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14, 2012 MSPB 93 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established by preponderant evidence that the agency denied restoration on November 11, 2008, August 6, 2009, and July 28, 2010.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's findings that the appellant demonstrated that she was absent from her position due to her compensable injury and that she recovered sufficiently to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her. We also find that the appellant established by preponderant evidence that the agency denied her requests for restoration. The record reflects that the agency restored the appellant to a modified or limited duty assignment after her compensable injury. On November 11, 2008, the agency reduced her workday from 8 hours to 5 hours pursuant to medical documentation indicating that she was limited to performing certain tasks for no longer than 5 hours per day. On August 6, 2009, the agency further reduced her workday from 5 hours per day to 2 hours per day pursuant to medical documentation indicating that she was limited to performing certain tasks for no longer than 2 hours per day. On July 28, 2010, the agency offered her a rehabilitation modified position of 2 hours per day. We find that these reductions in work hours constitute appealable denials of restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A partially recovered individual who has been restored to duty may not challenge the details or circumstances of the restoration. <span class="Italic">See Urena v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). The Board has found, however, that an agency's rescission of a previously provided restoration or the discontinuation of a limited duty position may constitute an appealable denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 9, 11;<span class="Italic"> see Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 11-12 (2010). The Board has additionally found that the agency's partial elimination of previously afforded limited duty constitutes a rescission of a previously provided restoration. <span class="Italic">Kinglee v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6; 14 (2010). In <span class="Italic">Kinglee,</span> the Board found, under the pre<span class="Italic">-Bledsoe/Latham</span> jurisdictional standard, that the appellant's allegation that the agency reduced the appellant's limited duty from 8 hours to 90 minutes per day pursuant to the NRP was a nonfrivolous allegation of a denial of restoration. Although<span class="Italic"> Kinglee</span> left open the question of whether affording part-time restoration in circumstances other than the agency's reduction of hours pursuant to its NRP constitutes a denial of restoration, we find no reason to distinguish the instant appeal on the basis that the reduction of hours occurred outside of the NRP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that this case is distinguishable from cases in which the Board found that a reduction of hours under the NRP constituted a denial of restoration because the circumstances here do not involve the issues considered during the NRP process, namely, whether necessary work was available rather than whether the employee had been provided work meeting her medical restrictions. Such a distinction is not relevant here, however, because the medical records from the appellant's doctor and the Department of Labor reflect that the appellant was capable of working 8 hours each day and required modified duty with respect to certain tasks. The agency stated that there <span id="Page_4499"></span>were no operationally necessary tasks within her medical restrictions and reduced her hours. Thus, the circumstances of this appeal are similar to any agency action under the NRP in which the agency conducted a search to determine whether operationally necessary work was available within an employee's medical restrictions. Consequently, we find that the appellant established by preponderant evidence that the agency denied restoration on November 11, 2008, when it reduced her hours to 5 hours per day, and August 6, 2009, when it reduced her hours to 2 hours per day.[2] <span class="Italic">See Bolton v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 11 (2010); <span class="Italic">Ferrin-Rodgers v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 140, &#x00B6; 13 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency argues that the appellant accepted the 5-hour assignment without protest and, therefore, she cannot be considered to have made a request for restoration that the agency denied. The Board has held, however, that the rescission of restoration rights previously granted or a discontinuation of a limited duty assignment may be a denial of restoration regardless of whether the action was protested by the employee. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sanchez,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 11. Further, it appears that this issue was raised with agency officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argued that the July 28, 2010 offer of the rehabilitation modified position under the NRP constituted a denial of restoration. The administrative judge found that this was simply a challenge to the terms and conditions of her restoration and not a denial of restoration over which the Board exercises jurisdiction. We disagree. On August 6, 2009, the agency rescinded its prior offer of restoration and reduced the appellant's workday to 2 hours per day. Thereafter, the agency offered a series of modified assignments for 2 hours per day. Each time, the appellant objected to the offer as not in accordance with the Department of Labor's recommendation that she work 8 hours per day. Thus, to the extent that the agency was formalizing the 2-hour workday under the NRP, we find that this also constitutes a denial of restoration consistent with the agency's original decision to rescind the modified assignment that it had previously provided to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established by preponderant evidence that the agency's denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant can demonstrate that the agency's denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious if the record establishes that the agency did not examine the entire local commuting area in determining the available work within the appellant's medical restrictions, as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">Ferrin-Rodgers,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 140, &#x00B6; 14. The appellant argued that the agency failed to search for alternative assignments in the local commuting area. The agency argued that there were only 2 hours of operationally necessary work within the appellant's medical restrictions and that the appellant's limitation on fine manipulation limited her work "both in the Manual Unit and in most positions in the facility." There is no indication, however, that the agency conducted a search for work within the appellant's medical restrictions in the local commuting area in 2008 or 2009; the record evidence only establishes that the agency searched for tasks for the appellant in her own facility. Further, the agency only submitted evidence that it conducted a search for work within the local commuting area in October 2010, pursuant to the NRP. Thus, because the record supports the appellant's unrebutted allegations that the agency did not conduct a search within the local commuting area in 2008 or 2009, we find that she has demonstrated by preponderant evidence that the agency's denials of restoration in November 2008 and August 2009 were arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez-Moreno v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 17 (2010); <span class="Italic">Urena,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, with respect to the October and November 2010 search within the local commuting area that the agency conducted pursuant to the NRP, which occurred after the appellant filed her initial appeal, the agency identified the appellant's restrictions as "no reaching above shoulder, pushing and lifting" and "not to exceed ten (10) pounds and two (2) hours total per work day." The appellant argues that the agency only looked for a total of 2 hours of work per workday, and, indeed, such language suggests that the appellant was limited to 2 hours of work per day rather than limited in specific activities to 2 hours of work per day. Although the agency argues that its delay of 4 months between the time that it offered the appellant the rehabilitation modified position and the time that it initiated a search of the local commuting area was not arbitrary and capricious, the search itself was limited to 2 hours of work per day rather than a search for tasks that could provide the appellant with a 40-hour workweek, <span class="Italic">see Bolton,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 16. Thus, we find that the improper search conducted by the agency was an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that it had no available work within the appellant's medical restrictions and that the reductions in her work hours were pursuant to the medical documentation that it received. Indeed, it has not been established that any tasks were available beyond the work provided to the appellant. The Board will not order the appellant restored to an assignment that was properly discontinued, nor will it order back pay based on such an assignment because that would put the appellant in a better position than if the wrongful action had not occurred. Rather, in a case like this one, in which the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious for lack of a proper job search, the Board has found that the appropriate remedy is for "the agency to conduct an appropriate search within the local commuting area retroactive to...the date of the appellant's request for restoration, and to consider her for any suitable vacancies." <span class="Italic">Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 411, &#x00B6; 21 (1999). The remedy of a retroactive job search will be sufficient to correct the wrongful action and substitute it with a correct one based on an appropriate search. It will not, however, put the appellant in a better position than she was in before the wrongful action because it leaves open the possibility that the agency might still be unable to find an appropriate assignment available as of November 11, 2008. The appellant may be entitled to back pay only if the agency's retroactive job search uncovers available work to which it could have restored her. Therefore, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Latham,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 77, 83, where the Board ordered the agency to retroactively restore two appellants to their former modified assignments. In those situations, the Board found that the agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously because the appellants established that the limited circumstances under which the agency could legitimately discontinue their modified assignments were not present. <span class="Italic">Latham,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 42, 49.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Adjustment in hours was not a denial of a restoration request when the appellant did not allege the agency failed to search for other work, <span class="Italic">King v. USPS</span>, CH-0353-15-0202-I-1 (NP 9/14/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the third prong, the appellant did not claim that the agency denied outright his request for restoration. Rather, he argued that the agency improperly restored him when his modified job assignment did not provide him with a full 8 hours of work per day. He asserted that working fewer than 8 hours per day affects his accrual of leave and prospects for retirement. Nevertheless, he presented no authority supporting the proposition that the agency's failure to assign him 8 hours of work per day constitutes a failure to restore him as a partially recovered employee. Had he shown that the agency eliminated his limited duty schedule, he would have made a nonfrivolous allegation that it denied his request for restoration. <span class="Italic">See Brehmer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). Likewise, had the agency partially eliminated previously afforded limited duty, he would have nonfrivolously alleged that the agency denied his restoration request. <span class="Italic">See Kinglee v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6; 14 (2010). A partially recovered employee, however, may not appeal an allegedly improper restoration, such as an agency's decision not to afford restoration to a full-time schedule. <span class="Italic">Zysk v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 6 (2008). He may only appeal from an agency's denial of restoration and only on the grounds that such a denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there are circumstances in which restoration of a partially recovered employee may be deemed so unreasonable as to amount to a denial of restoration within the Board's jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Foley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 6 (2001), the appellant has not come forward with sufficient facts to meet the fourth prong of the jurisdictional standard. To show that an agency's denial of restoration is arbitrary and capricious, an appellant must either: (1) identify a vacant position, or positions, within the local commuting area that he could perform within his medical restrictions; or (2) set forth facts showing that either the agency did not search the entire local commuting area for vacant positions or that the agency's claim that there are no vacant positions available for him within the local commuting area is in some way untrue. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 66; <span class="Italic">Patino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 9 (2010); <span class="Italic">Urena v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 13 (2009); <span class="Italic">Hogarty v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the agency continued to find available work for the appellant within his medical restrictions to the extent that such work existed, including during the period following the agency's September 2014 offer of a modified job assignment. He has continued to receive work within his restrictions, including <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> tasks that allow him to work significantly more than 2 hours per day. During the grievance proceedings, the agency presented evidence establishing that it had examined the entire local commuting area in determining whether there was available work within his medical restrictions and that the appellant had declined to take on additional duties at stations other than Morgan Park.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency had not conducted such a search. <span class="Italic">See Urena</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 13 (finding that, in response to the agency's evidence, an appellant may come forward with nonfrivolous allegations that the agency did not actually search the local commuting area as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d)). Although he generally asserted that some similarly situated employees were given more hours than he had been given, such vague assertions are insufficient to meet his jurisdictional burden. He did not, for example, allege that the other employees faced medical restrictions similar to his own restrictions <span id="Page_4500"></span>or that they worked full 8-hour days during the same pay periods that he did not. We also note that he did not acknowledge that his time and attendance records show that he often worked considerably more than 2 hours per day. Accordingly, even if the appellant had met the third prong of the jurisdictional standard and had nonfrivolously alleged that the agency had denied him restoration, he failed to meet the fourth prong and nonfrivolously allege that the denial was arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robles v. USPS</span>, SF-0353-15-0837-I-1 (NP 6/28/2016) ("The reduction of hours previously provided as part of a limited-duty job offer can give rise to a restoration claim. <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 9. In addition, the appellant has alleged that, beginning January 19, 2015, she requested to return 'into [her] long time limited duty assignment, and [her] requests have been denied, ignored and disregarded.' Therefore, we find that the appellant has met her burden to nonfrivolously allege that the agency denied her request for restoration."). [Refer to Chapter 6, "Disputed Restoration Right."]</p>
