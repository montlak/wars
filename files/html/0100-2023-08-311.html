<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-304"><span class="space">a.</span> Dismissal From Employment; Demotion; Abandonment of Civilian Career</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jasper v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 367, 369-71 (1997), demonstrates a USERRA challenge to the dismissal of an employee whose service was insufficient to meet statutory requirements for ordinary Board appellate jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-353, 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 3149 (USERRA), the Board has appellate jurisdiction over appeals of "any person" alleging discrimination in federal employment on account of prior military service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 4311(a), 4303(4)(A)(ii), 4324(b); <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 71 MSPR 227, 231-40 (1996). USERRA provides that a person may submit an appeal against a federal executive agency alleging discrimination on the basis of prior military service directly to the Board or he may submit such an appeal to the Board after he has filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, and proceedings there are exhausted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 4324(b). Employees who have not completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions qualify as "persons" under USERRA and thus are not excluded from filing appeals under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant is not an "employee" with Board appeal rights under 5 USC 7511 because he had not completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position at the time of his termination. However, USERRA gives the Board jurisdiction to decide the appellant's allegation that the agency's termination action was discriminatory on the basis of his status as a disabled veteran, notwithstanding that he was serving a probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 232. Accordingly, <span id="Page_522"></span>we remand this appeal to the Dallas Field Office for adjudication under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon remand, the administrative judge must determine whether the appeal is currently ripe for adjudication because the appellant has chosen not to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, and filed directly with the Board, or whether adjudication must be delayed because the appellant sought the assistance of the Secretary by filing a complaint within the meaning of 38 USC 4322, and proceedings before the Secretary have not been exhausted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 4324(b)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appeal is currently ripe for adjudication, we find further, that the appellant is entitled to a decision on the merits of his USERRA appeal. As noted above, USERRA specifically prohibits an employer from denying an individual employment on account of his prior military service, and the appellant has claimed here that the agency terminated him because of his prior military service. The appellant established that he has prior military service by submitting a letter showing his receipt of disability compensation on account of his service-connected disability. The appellant is thus entitled to a hearing on the merits of his allegation that the agency terminated him because of that service. If he proves that allegation, he will have established a violation of USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 235-37.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Duncan v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 86 (1997), the Board held that, if an appellant supports his claim of a violation of USERRA through the use of direct evidence of discriminatory intent, the administrative judge shall analyze his claim in accordance with the USERRA standard of review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 4311(b); <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 239-40. On the other hand, if an appellant supports his claim more indirectly by showing that discriminatory intent could be inferred from relevant circumstantial evidence, the administrative judge should apply analogous burdens of proof and production under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for analyzing discrimination claims based on circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 508 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table) <span class="Italic">See also Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 132 (1989) (application of Title VII burdens of proof and production to an age-discrimination claim); <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637, 646-48 (1981) (use of Title VII burdens of proof and production in a disability-discrimination case).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts his argument that circumstantial evidence establishes that he was discriminated against based on his military service and service-connected disability when his appointment was terminated. These same arguments were presented before the administrative judge and thoroughly analyzed in the initial decision. In a USERRA action there must be an initial showing by the employee that his military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Discriminatory motive or intent may be proven by circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly considered the appellant's argument that circumstantial evidence shows that his military service and service-connected disability were factors in the agency's decision to terminate his appointment, yet he found that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proof. As properly set forth by the administrative judge, the factors that may prove an inference of USERRA discrimination include: proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action; inconsistencies between the proffered reasons and other actions by the employer; an employer's expressed hostility toward members protected by USERRA together with knowledge of the employee's military activity; and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to employees with similar work records or offenses. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. The appellant argues on review that the agency's choice to appoint him to a term appointment instead of to reinstate him is part of the circumstantial evidence in support of his USERRA discrimination claim. We find that the method of the appellant's appointment and the other circumstantial evidence he relies on to support his USERRA claim do not meet his burden of proof because he has not shown disparate treatment, animus toward members protected by USERRA, proximity in time between his military activity and the termination, or any other facts that would establish a nexus between the agency's action and his military service or service-connected disability. Because the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proof is supported a preponderance of the evidence and the applicable law, we discern no reason to disturb this finding on review. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 106 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant committed the misconduct underlying the decision to terminate his appointment. Contrary to the appellant's argument, the initial decision does not make a finding regarding the allegations of misconduct. The administrative judge provided notice to both parties that the merits of the decision to terminate the appellant's appointment was not the issue before him stating, "I note that the Board's jurisdiction under USERRA does not extend beyond the complained of discrimination based on military or related status; it does not allow for a decision on the merits of the underlying matter except to the extent necessary to address the appellant's USERRA claim." The initial decision properly analyzes the appellant's USERRA claim without deciding the merits of the underlying decision to terminate his appointment. <span class="Italic">See Bodus v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 508, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17 (1999) (even if the underlying personnel action was improper on some other grounds, the Board cannot order remedial action in a USERRA appeal if the appellant fails to prove discrimination based on military service). The burden in the appeal never shifted to the agency to prove a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating the appellant's appointment because he failed to meet his initial burden of showing that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014 (an employee must make an initial showing that his military status was a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action before the burden shifts to the agency prove that it would have taken the action despite the employee's protected status).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that the appellant's requests for an unredacted copy of the police investigation, medical information concerning the alleged victim, and the social security numbers and addresses of the alleged victim and one other witness were not relevant to his USERRA claim. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues generally that the agency lacked a valid basis for terminating her during probation. However, the USERRA statute does not confer jurisdiction on the Board to address an agency's underlying personnel action when, as here, the merits of that action are not otherwise appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Wooten v.

VA</span>, 102 MSPR 131, 2006 MSPB 136 (2006), a nonselection case cited in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, explained that USERRA does not make a nonselection appealable to the Board; instead the Board is to determine if military service was a motivating factor in the agency's decision. From that, the Board reasoned that the Board lacked jurisdiction to address the underlying personnel action "where the merits of that action are not otherwise appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Wooten</span>, at &#x00B6; 13. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum v.

Assuming nonfrivolous allegations of discriminatory motivation for a challenged action, consideration of the reasons offered for that action should be relevant to rebut discriminatory motive or to establish pretext.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGuffin v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20191107120">942 F.3d 1099</a>, 1108-11 (Fed. Cir. 2019), determined that the appellant made out a USERRA claim when he was terminated before the end of his first year of employment for allegations of performance problems (as a veteran, he would have had MSPB appeal rights from a termination after completing a year of service), and another attorney, not a preference eligible, who had a two-year probationary period and allegedly had performance problems in the same office as appellant, was allowed to continue into a second year of employment (when, on completion of the second year, she would have had MSPB appeal rights):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first turn to whether Mr. McGuffin sufficiently proved by preponderant evidence that his preference-eligible veteran status was a substantial or motivating factor in his termination. "[M]ilitary service is a motivating factor for an adverse employment action if the employer 'relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision' on the employee's military-related...obligation." <span class="Italic">McMillan</span>, 812 F.3d at 1372 (quoting <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368). Because employers "rarely concede an improper motivation for their employment actions," employees may meet their burden by submitting evidence from which such a motive may be fairly inferred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine if discriminatory motive can be reasonably inferred, this court considers the so-called four, non-exclusive "<span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> factors," which are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_523"></span>[1]&#x2003;proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, [2] inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, [3] an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and [4] disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that SSA's rush to terminate Mr. McGuffin before he obtained his CSRA benefits was a proper exercise of its "management prerogative." SSA, however, cannot escape liability under USERRA when Mr. McGuffin's CSRA benefits are intrinsically tied to his preference-eligible veteran status. Guiding our reasoning is <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, in which this court explained that an employer cannot discriminate against an employee for action that is intrinsically tied to his military service. <span class="Italic">See Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, the Postal Service stated that the sole reason for removing the employee was his excessive use of military leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found that "Erickson had failed to show that his military service was a motivating factor for the agency's action because the 'real reason' for his removal was his absence from work--regardless of whether that absence was caused by his military obligation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This court rejected that argument, holding that "[a]n employer cannot escape liability under USERRA by claiming that it was merely discriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when that absence was for military service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Permitting otherwise "would eviscerate the protections afforded by USERRA" to those who serve or have served in the military. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. So too here. The one-year timeline for obtaining CSRA benefits is intertwined with a veteran's prior military service. If employers could discriminate against veterans based on this one-year timeline, then what Congress created as a benefit to veterans for their service--a shortened timeframe for obtaining CSRA protection--could be turned against the veteran by employers, who, like ALJ McGraw, "would prefer not to have to go through the formal process of an MSPB hearing." Thus, the proper inquiry on appeal is not simply whether Mr. McGuffin's preference-eligible veteran status played a substantial or motivating factor in his termination, but also whether it was a substantial or motivating factor in SSA's <span class="Italic">timing</span> of his termination, which occurred four days before he was set to receive CSRA benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, no reasonable inference of discrimination under the <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> factors is needed. The record compels a finding that SSA's decision to terminate Mr. McGuffin <span class="Italic">when it did</span>--four days before he completed one year of employment--was substantially motivated by Mr. McGuffin's preference-eligible veteran status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To summarize, by late October 2010, after becoming aware of Mr. McGuffin's preference-eligible veteran status, SSA decided that Mr. McGuffin "must" be terminated before his one-year mark in order to prevent him from receiving CSRA benefits. Then, from November 2010 to December 2010, Mr. McGuffin's supervisors refused to offer additional training to Mr. McGuffin and became solely focused on finalizing his termination before his one-year mark. In January 2011, at the behest of Ms. Bosworth, Mr. McGuffin's supervisors finally placed Mr. McGuffin in additional training. Despite Mr. McGuffin's dramatic increase in his DWSI rating and positive feedback from ALJ Bowling during the training, Mr. Strong characterized Mr. McGuffin as not having "fared well" during January 2011 and pressed forward with terminating Mr. McGuffin. The record is clear that SSA closed the door on Mr. McGuffin well before the end of his first year to avoid the inconvenience of defending itself should Mr. McGuffin assert his procedural safeguards afforded under the CSRA. For these reasons, substantial evidence supports only one conclusion: Mr. McGuffin's preference-eligible veteran status was a substantial factor in SSA's decision to terminate Mr. McGuffin just four days shy of his one-year anniversary at SSA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that Mr. McGuffin carried his burden under the USERRA inquiry, we now turn to whether SSA carried its burden to prove that it terminated Mr. McGuffin for a valid reason. The Board determined that SSA sufficiently proved that Mr. McGuffin was terminated because he was a "poor" performer who had not demonstrated the "required productivity, timeliness and quality after a year of training."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The documentary evidence, however, does not support a finding that Mr. McGuffin was a poorly performing new hire attorney advisor. As previously noted, SSA evaluates newly hired attorney advisors like Mr. McGuffin under a limited evaluation plan during the first year. The record indicates, however, that Mr. Thompson and Mr. Strong instead held Mr. McGuffin to a higher standard of meeting his "fair share," an evaluation element that is applied to attorney advisors only after their first year of employment. The record further indicates that Mr. Thompson and Mr. Strong became fixated on Mr. McGuffin's inability to meet his fair share, having noted this concern multiple times in Mr. McGuffin's October 2010 evaluation report, as well as raising it with Ms. Bosworth. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Strong knew that this element was not applicable to Mr. McGuffin until his second year, at which point Mr. McGuffin would acquire his CSRA benefits. Not willing to wait until then, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Strong, with the help of Ms. Bosworth, modified the "engages in new learning" element to implicitly contain a fair share standard. For example, after instructing Mr. Thompson that the fair share standard could not be a basis for Mr. McGuffin's termination, Ms. Bosworth recrafted Mr. McGuffin's draft termination letter by replacing the "fair share" reference with a reference to an inability to independently complete his work, a sub-element to the "engages in new learning" element.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disregarding the improper references to Mr. McGuffin's inability to meet his fair share and other numeric data, the agency's evaluation report for October 2010 indicates that Mr. McGuffin successfully met the limited two element evaluation standard for new hires. Furthermore, despite SSA's argument that the "quality" of Mr. McGuffin's work was lacking, Mr. Thompson testified at Mr. McGuffin's EEOC hearing that Mr. McGuffin had to re-write a decision on only two occasions throughout his first year at SSA. Additionally, these two occasions occurred in late December 2010 and January 2011, well after Mr. Thompson had already decided in early November 2010 that Mr. McGuffin should be fired instead of being trained. Mr. Thompson further testified at that same EEOC hearing that it was "not uncommon" for an ALJ to be "unhappy with a decision" drafted by an attorney advisor and to require edits to that decision. In addition, the record indicates that Mr. McGuffin received positive feedback from various ALJs about the quality of his work. This evidence demonstrates that Mr. McGuffin was not performing poorly, let alone so poorly as to justify the agency's rush to remove him four days before his one-year mark. For these reasons, SSA's purported reason for terminating Mr. McGuffin--his poor performance--is inconsistent with the documentary evidence, which points to only one reasonable motive: SSA rushed to terminate Mr. McGuffin four days before he completed his first year at the agency solely to prevent him from obtaining CSRA benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that, based on the testimony of Mr. Strong, Mr. Thompson, and ALJ McGraw, SSA sufficiently proved that Mr. McGuffin was validly terminated due to his poor performance. The Board noted that Mr. McGuffin's supervisors "credibl[y]" testified that they would have terminated any employee who was performing as poorly as Mr. McGuffin "after almost a year of training." The testimony relied on by the Board, however, is undermined by the documentary evidence reviewed above and, thus, the Board erred by not giving due weight to this evidence. The Board may not insulate its findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations when "documents or objective evidence may contradict the witness' story." <span class="Italic">Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C</span>., 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985); <span class="Italic">see also Jones v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 834 F.3d 1361, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, as noted above, the preference-eligible veteran must satisfy his statutory burden. If met, then the burden shifts to the employer, who must show a "valid" reason for terminating a preference-eligible veteran within his probationary period to not run afoul of USERRA. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013. SSA's improper evaluation of Mr. McGuffin based on the fair share standard, SSA's delay in providing Mr. McGuffin with adequate training, and its disregard of the positive results of that training in January 2011 do not support Mr. Strong's self-serving and incorrect statement that the agency "bent over backwards to try to be fair," or a conclusion that SSA was honestly dissatisfied with Mr. McGuffin's performance. Instead, the record indicates that SSA was honestly concerned with the administrative burden of defending itself should Mr. McGuffin assert his CSRA procedural safeguards. For these reasons, substantial evidence does not support a finding that SSA terminated Mr. McGuffin <span class="Italic">when it did</span> for poor performance. To be clear, USERRA allows for termination of veterans within their first year of employment so long as the employer's reason for termination is valid. Based on the circumstances of this case, however, substantial evidence does not support such a conclusion. SSA's discriminatory treatment of Mr. McGuffin violates USERRA's objective of protecting veterans from being disadvantaged in the workplace by virtue of their military service, and, thus, cannot stand. <span class="Italic">See Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency is not precluded from separating an employee returning from military service for reasons that predate his departure for the military. An employee's separation or demotion for reasons that developed before military service, challenged under USERRA as a violation of restoration rights, will be adjudicated solely on the basis of whether the individual was separated because of his military service. <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 686, 694-95 (1992), involved an appellant who, shortly after returning from military service, was demoted from a probationary supervisory appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he requirement set forth at section 2021(b)(1) that the returning veteran not be discharged "without cause" does not preclude an agency from demoting an individual who has been promoted to a supervisory or managerial position for not satisfactorily completing the probationary period under 5 USC 3321. "Cause" need not be "legal" cause but "may not be mere excuse or an arbitrary action" to avoid the statutory restoration requirement. In short, the test "is whether or not the discharge by the employer was a reasonable one under the circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Kemp v. <span id="Page_524"></span>John Chatillon &#x0026; Sons</span>, Inc., 169 F.2d 203, 206-07 (3rd Cir. 1948), and <span class="Italic">Keserich v. Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp.</span>, 163 F.2d 889, 890-91 (7th Cir. 1947) (construing section 8 of the Selective Service Act, the predecessor to section 2021). <span class="Italic">See also Burkart v. Post-Browning, Inc.</span>, 859 F.2d 1245, 1247-48 (6th Cir. 1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Standard Oil Co.</span>, 452 U.S. 549, 559, 101 S. Ct. 2510, 2516, 69 L. Ed.2d 226 (1981) ("The legislative history...indicates that 2021(b)(3) was enacted for the significant but limited purpose of protecting the employee-reservist against discriminations like discharge and demotion, motivated solely by reserve status.")).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, since the appointment of an individual who has not completed his probationary period in a supervisory or managerial position, like that of a probationer in the competitive service, has not become final under 5 USC 3321, such an individual is not entitled to the procedural protections afforded employees under Chapters 43 and 75 of title 5, or to minimum due process requirements for tenured employees, where the action is taken for performance-related reasons. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 680-81, 684-87 (an agency is required to afford a nonprobationary employee his essential due process rights of notice and an opportunity to respond; failure to apply the procedural protections under 5 USC Chapters 43 and 75 to nonprobationary employee constitutes harmful error under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C) where actual harm is shown). Nor is there any right of appeal to the Board on the demotion action itself, except for claims of marital status or partisan political activity discrimination. 5 CFR 315.908.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board's review authority in deciding an improper restoration claim is limited to whether the agency action was motivated solely by the individual's veteran or reserve status, and was therefore pretextual.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may separate an employee whose absence on military leave is prolonged with no likelihood of a return to the civilian capacity in the foreseeable future.

<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of the proposed removal, February 2000, the appellant had been absent for all but 2 days of the previous 3 years. The appellant initially enlisted with the Florida Army National Guard for 3 years in December 1990. At the time of his removal, he was serving under his fifth consecutive voluntary re-enlistment. The agency sent the appellant a letter, dated January 4, 2000, requiring that he contact the agency. The appellant responded by telephoning Labor Relations Specialist Rosalyn Warner, who questioned him concerning whether he intended to return to his postal position, or to continue his full-time military service into the foreseeable future. The appellant informed Ms. Warner that he would be on full-time active duty until the end of 2000, at least, and said that he did not like working for the agency and liked working for the military better.<span class="Italic"></span> The Board has long held that a prolonged absence with no foreseeable end constitutes just cause for removal. <span class="Italic">See McKenzie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 496, 497 (1980). USERRA entitles the appellant to treatment equal to that of a non-veteran, but not better treatment; to establish USERRA discrimination, the appellant must show he was treated more harshly than a non-veteran. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Tully v.

As removal of a nonveteran is justified for a charge of prolonged absence without foreseeable end, USERRA does not protect the appellant from such an adverse action simply because of his military status. As the appellant had been, in essence, continuously absent from his position for over 3 years and had expressed at the time an inclination not to return to his civilian position in the foreseeable future, the agency's removal of the appellant was for a valid, non-discriminatory reason. The appellant therefore has failed to prove that the agency committed prohibited discrimination under USERRA when it removed him.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 ("USERRA") represents Congress's most recent effort to encourage noncareer military service "by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a). USERRA prohibits discrimination against civilian employees because of their military obligations, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, and it provides reemployment rights to those who leave their jobs to serve in the uniformed services, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Richard Erickson, a former employee of the United States Postal Service, claims that the Postal Service violated his USERRA rights when it removed him from his position on account of his military service and refused to reemploy him after he completed that service. He pressed his claims before the Merit Systems Protection Board, but the Board rejected them. We agree with the Board that Mr. Erickson failed to make a timely request for reemployment with the agency, and for that reason, we uphold the Board's ruling that the Postal Service did not unlawfully refuse to reemploy him after his service. With respect to his claim of discrimination based on military service, we reject the Board's rationale for rejecting his claim, and we remand for the Board to address the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Erickson waived his USERRA rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of one in the military.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson was employed by the Postal Service from 1988 until he was removed from his position in 2000. Throughout his employment with the agency, Mr. Erickson served in the Army National Guard Reserve. During that period, he was absent from his position with the Postal Service for lengthy periods of time while he was on active duty with the National Guard. Between 1991 and 1995, he was absent from his Postal Service position for a total of more than 22 months, and between 1996 and the date of his removal in 2000, he worked at the Postal Service for no more than four days. In January 2000, a labor relations specialist from the Postal Service contacted Mr. Erickson by telephone to determine whether he intended to return to his position with the agency or continue serving in the military. Mr. Erickson responded that he would not report back to work with the agency until he completed his current tour of duty in September 2001. In the course of that conversation, he stated that he preferred military service to working for the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly thereafter, the Postal Service issued a notice proposing to remove Mr. Erickson from his position because of excessive use of military leave. The notice stated that in the course of his tenure with the agency, he had been on military leave for more than five years, excluding weekend drills and annual training. Because USERRA contains a five-year limit on the amount of military leave an employee may use while retaining employment rights, the agency advised Mr. Erickson that he was no longer entitled to occupy his position with the Postal Service. Mr. Erickson did not respond to the notice of proposed removal, and on March 31, 2000, the agency issued a final decision removing him from his position because of his absence. Mr. Erickson subsequently re-enlisted with the National Guard and remained on active military duty until December 31, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 28, 2006, nine months after the end of his military duty, Mr. Erickson filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board alleging that the agency had violated his USERRA rights by removing him from his position based on his military service. The administrative judge who was assigned to the appeal found that at the time of Mr. Erickson's removal in 2000, his cumulative military leave did not exceed the five-year cap set by USERRA, because some of Mr. Erickson's military service was statutorily exempt from the five-year service limit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(c). The administrative judge further concluded that the agency had violated USERRA's nondiscrimination provision, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, when it removed Mr. Erickson for excessive use of military leave: "Because appellant was removed solely because of his military service, the evidence of record supports a finding that appellant's military service was 'a substantial factor' in appellant's termination from the Postal Service." However, the administrative judge concluded that Mr. Erickson had waived his USERRA rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of one in the military. The administrative judge therefore issued an initial decision denying Mr. Erickson's USERRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Challenging the administrative judge's finding that he had abandoned his civilian employment, Mr. Erickson filed a petition for review by the full Board. The agency opposed that petition and filed a cross-petition for review alleging that the administrative judge had erred in failing to address its argument that Mr. Erickson did not make a proper request for reemployment with the agency. The Board affirmed the initial decision denying Mr. Erickson's appeal "as modified" by its final order, but it did not address the question whether Mr. Erickson had abandoned his civilian career in favor of one in the military. Instead, the Board found that Mr. Erickson's military service was not, as the administrative judge had concluded, a motivating factor in the agency's decision to remove him, because "the agency's removal notice makes clear that the real reason for the appellant's removal was his absence regardless of its cause." Thus, the Board concluded that Mr. Erickson did not show that the agency had violated USERRA's nondiscrimination provision when it removed him from his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also found that Mr. Erickson did not submit a timely request for reemployment with the agency, and that even if he done so, he no longer retained reemployment rights under section 4312 because at the <span id="Page_525"></span>time of his appeal in 2006 his cumulative absence exceeded the five-year limit set by USERRA. For those reasons, the full Board concluded that Mr. Erickson failed to demonstrate that the agency had violated his USERRA rights. <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 494 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson maintains that the agency committed two independent USERRA violations with respect to his removal. First, he contends that the agency discriminated against him, in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, when it removed him in 2000 from his position because of his excessive use of military leave. Second, he asserts that the agency violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312 when it refused to reemploy him in 2005 after he had completed his military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4311 prohibits discrimination on the basis of military service. It provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). USERRA discrimination claims are analyzed under a burden-shifting mechanism. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). An employee who makes a discrimination claim under USERRA bears the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action. If the employee makes that <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating, as an affirmative defense, that it would have taken the same action without regard to the employee's military service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1013; <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1). An employer therefore violates section 4311 if it would not have taken the adverse employment action but for the employee's military service or obligation. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 24 (1993), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2457; <span class="Italic">see also Pittman v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 486 F.3d 1276, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its notice of removal, the Postal Service stated that the sole reason for removing Mr. Erickson from his position was his excessive use of military leave. The full Board acknowledged that "on its face" that admitted purpose would seem to constitute direct evidence of discrimination under USERRA. Nonetheless, the Board found that Mr. Erickson had failed to show that his military service was a motivating factor for the agency's action because the "real reason" for his removal was his absence from work--regardless of whether that absence was caused by his military obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject that argument. An employer cannot escape liability under USERRA by claiming that it was merely discriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when that absence was for military service. As other courts have held, military service is a motivating factor for an adverse employment action if the employer "relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision" on the employee's military-related absence or obligation. <span class="Italic">Petty v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville-Davidson County,</span> 538 F.3d 431, 446 (6th Cir. 2008), <span class="Italic">quoting Coffman v. Chugach Support Servs.,</span> 411 F.3d 1231, 1238 (11th Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">see Robinson v. Morris Moore Chevrolet-Buick, Inc.,</span> 974 F. Supp. 571, 576 (E.D. Tex. 1997), <span class="Italic">citing Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</span> 490 U.S. 228, 241-42 (1989). The most significant--and predictable--consequence of reserve service with respect to the employer is that the employee is absent to perform that service. To permit an employer to fire an employee because of his military absence would eviscerate the protections afforded by USERRA, the overarching goal of which is to prevent those who serve in the uniformed services from being disadvantaged by virtue of performing their military obligations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a); <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 90-1477, at 2 (1968), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3421, 3421 (stating that the precursor to section 4311 was enacted in response to the "increasing problem" of discrimination against reservists who were discharged or denied benefits because of their obligation to attend military drills or training exercises).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In upholding the agency's action as nondiscriminatory, the Board relied on the fact that an agency is otherwise entitled to remove an employee for prolonged non-military leaves of absence. But as we held in the case of the precursor to section 4311, "an employer can not treat employees on military duty like those on non-military leave of absence." <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 142 F.3d 1444, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">citing Carlson v. N.H. Dep't of Safety,</span> 609 F.2d 1024, 1027 (1st Cir. 1979) ("The mandated standard of comparison is not...to those coworkers away on non-military leave of absence.") (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the fact that the Postal Service could have lawfully removed Mr. Erickson if his absence had not been service related does not excuse its action in this case. Mr. Erickson was absent from work because of his military service, and USERRA protects against removal for that reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's explanation that firing Mr. Erickson was necessary in order to fill his position in the Postal Service is similarly without merit. The Supreme Court rejected that argument in <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Standard Oil Co.,</span> 452 U.S. 549 (1981), its first decision construing the antecedent to USERRA's nondiscrimination provision. The Court wrote:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he nondiscrimination requirements of [the statute] impose substantial obligations upon employers. The frequent absences from work of an employee-reservist may affect productivity and cause considerable inconvenience to an employer who must find alternative means to get necessary work done. Yet Congress has provided...that employers may not rid themselves of such inconveniences and productivity losses by discharging or otherwise disadvantaging employee-reservists solely because of their military obligations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Monroe,</span> 452 U.S. at 565. Congress enacted USERRA in part to make clear that discrimination in employment occurs when a person's military service is "a motivating factor," and not to require, as <span class="Italic">Monroe</span> had suggested, that military service be the sole motivating factor for the adverse employment action. H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 24, <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2457; <span class="Italic">see Sheehan,</span> 240 F.3d at 1012-13. That change broadened the employment protections afforded to reservists, <span class="Italic">see Sheehan</span> 240 F.3d at 1013; it did not alter <span class="Italic">Monroe's</span> unambiguous instruction that discharging an employee because of his military-related absence constitutes unlawful discrimination. The fact that the Postal Service may have wanted to fill Mr. Erickson's position (presumably with an employee who was not performing military service) cannot shield it from liability for removing him from his position based on his military-related absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service was not required to hold Mr. Erickson's job for him indefinitely. Section 4312 provides that employees are entitled to reemployment only if the cumulative length of their absence due to military service does not exceed five years, absent certain excepted categories of service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a), (c). The five-year cap also applies to section 4311 where, as here, the alleged discrimination consists of the employee's removal because of his military-related absence; otherwise, the five-year limit on an employer's obligation to rehire an employee who left work to serve in the military would be meaningless. In this case, however, it is undisputed that Mr. Erickson's cumulative military absence at the time of his 2000 removal did not exceed five years (after accounting for statutorily exempt service) and that the agency erred in stating otherwise in its notice of removal. Thus, Mr. Erickson retained employment rights under USERRA when the agency removed him from his position in 2000. For the reasons outlined above, that action constituted unlawful discrimination under section 4311.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA also provides service members protection in the form of a right to reemployment in their civilian jobs after completing their military obligations. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a). As noted, that right attaches only if the cumulative length of all the employee's service-related absences from his civilian job does not exceed five years, not counting excepted service periods. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 4312(a)(2), (c). Section 4312 also requires an employee to provide timely notification to his employer of his intention to return to work; employees who have served in the military for more than 180 days must submit an application for reemployment no more than 90 days after completing their military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 4312(e)(1)(D).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its final decision, the Board found that even after deducting statutorily exempt service, Mr. Erickson's cumulative absence at the time he completed his military service in December 2005 exceeded five years. The Board therefore concluded that he was no longer entitled to reemployment rights under USERRA. Mr. Erickson contends that much of his military service was exempted under section 4312(c) because he was placed on "stop loss" status in 2002. He further argues that the entire time he served in the military after his removal in 2000 should not count towards the five-year service limit because he performed that service in order to mitigate the economic harm caused by the agency's unlawful removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.103(b). We need not resolve those issues, however, because we agree with the Board that regardless of whether Mr. Erickson exceeded USERRA's five-year service limit, he failed to make a proper request for reemployment within the statutory time frame.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Erickson completed his military service on December 31, 2005, he was required to submit an application for reemployment with the agency by April 1, 2006, but there is no evidence that he did so. Although he suggested in a deposition that he had asked an agency official for his job back shortly after his removal, he conceded at oral argument that he had merely "expressed a concern" that he was unlawfully removed in violation of USERRA and that he did not affirmatively request to be reemployed by the agency. Similarly, while Mr. Erickson states that he was in frequent contact with his union regarding alleged violations of his USERRA rights (both before and after his removal), he has not provided any evidence that the union sought his reemployment with the agency. An application for reemployment under section 4312 requires more than <span id="Page_526"></span>"a mere inquiry," <span class="Italic">McGuire v. United Parcel Serv.,</span> 152 F.3d 673, 676 (7th Cir. 1998), and Mr. Erickson's actions were insufficient to constitute requests for reemployment under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson asserts that the appeal he filed with the Board on September 28, 2006, put the Postal Service on notice that he was requesting reemployment, and he points to a May 2007 submission to the Board in which he explicitly invoked his reemployment rights. Regardless of whether those actions serve as applications for reemployment under the statute, however, Mr. Erickson did not take either of those actions within 90 days of completing his military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson next argues that he is entitled to a two-year extension of the application period because of an injury he sustained in the course of his military service. But the USERRA provision on which Mr. Erickson relies, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(e)(2)(a), does not provide a blanket two-year extension of the application deadline to all those who were injured during military service. Rather, the statute states that a person who is "hospitalized for, or convalescing from" a service-connected illness or injury shall submit an application for reemployment "at the end of the period that is necessary for the person to recover from such illness or injury," and it limits that recovery period to two years. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(e)(2)(a). As the Board noted, Mr. Erickson has not adduced any evidence that he was hospitalized for or otherwise incapacitated by his service-connected injury. Nor has he shown that he submitted an application for reemployment at the end of any period necessary for him to recover from that injury, as required by the statute. He therefore cannot avail himself of the extension to the 90-day statutory deadline. The Board thus correctly held that he had failed to make a timely application for reemployment under section 4312.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Board's initial decision, the administrative judge concluded that the agency unlawfully discriminated against Mr. Erickson when it removed him from his position because of his military service. Nonetheless, the administrative judge denied Mr. Erickson's USERRA claim on the ground that he had waived his USERRA rights by abandoning his civilian career to pursue a career in the military. In reaching that conclusion, the administrative judge relied on Mr. Erickson's stated preference for military work, his long and distinguished military career during much of which he was absent from his Postal Service position, and his failure to take any steps to obtain reemployment with the Postal Service until he filed his appeal with the Board nine months after his separation from the military.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because USERRA applies to noncareer military service, an employee can waive his USERRA rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of one in the military. <span class="Italic">Woodman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 258 F.3d 1372, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In the <span class="Italic">Woodman</span> case, for example, we upheld the Board's conclusion that an employee who had served continuously as a full-time member in the active guard reserve for 14 years and sought multiple service extensions intended to make a permanent career in the military. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1379; <span class="Italic">see also Dowling v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 393 F.3d 1260, 1262-63 (Fed.

Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 393 F.3d 1263, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem in this case is that the full Board did not address the issue of abandonment in its final decision, even though the initial decision was based on the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Erickson had abandoned his civilian career. Although the Board reached the same result as the administrative judge, it did so by another route, reversing the administrative judge's finding that the agency had violated USERRA's nondiscrimination provision and holding that Mr. Erickson was ineligible for reemployment rights under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service asserts that in affirming the initial decision "as modified," the full Board necessarily adopted the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Erickson had abandoned his civilian career. We are unwilling to treat the Board's silence as an implicit adoption of the administrative judge's findings of fact on that matter. The Board's final decision is equally (if not more) amenable to the interpretation that the Board intended to affirm the administrative judge's denial of Mr. Erickson's USERRA appeal, but on different grounds. Because the extent to which the full Board adopted the administrative judge's factual findings is uncertain at best, we remand so that the Board can explicitly address whether Mr. Erickson waived his USERRA rights by abandoning his civilian career to pursue one in the military.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board determined that Mr. Erickson abandoned his career in the civil service to pursue his military career, <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 41, 44-45 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2010 MSPB 4 (2010) (vacated and remanded, <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 636 F.3d 1353 (Fed.

USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 468, 2013 MSPB 101 (2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has held that, because the reemployment provisions of USERRA, which may include discrimination claims under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, apply only to noncareer military service, an employee can waive his USERRA rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of one in the military. <span class="Italic">Woodman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 258 F.3d 1372, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In determining whether an employee has done so, the key inquiry is whether he intended to pursue a military career. <span class="Italic">Moravec v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 393 F.3d 1263, 1267-68 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Dowling v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 393 F.3d 1260, 1262 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Among the factors that may contribute to a finding of abandonment are lengthy and continuous service in the active guard reserve and multiple requests for service extensions. <span class="Italic">See Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1378-79 (finding that an employee who served continuously as a full-time member in the active guard reserve for 14 years and sought multiple service extensions intended to make permanent a career in the military). At the time of his removal, the only alleged USERRA violation still at issue, the appellant was serving his fifth consecutive voluntary reenlistment, and had been serving full-time in the active guard reserve for 6 of the past 10 years, the last 4 years continuously. <span class="Italic">Erickson,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 494, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's continuous full-time military service at the time of the alleged USERRA violation was not as lengthy as that of the employee in <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> there are other circumstances present here that weigh in favor of a finding that the appellant intended to abandon his civilian career. We find the appellant's expressed preference for military over civilian service especially significant in this regard. <span class="Italic">See Gadue v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 14 (2004) (finding abandonment where, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, employee testified that he chose to enter on active guard duty because the position to which he was to be assigned "looked a lot better" and because of the "promotion possibilities" it offered). In addition, we find that the appellant's failure to respond to the notice of proposed removal, or to grieve or file a chapter 75 appeal of the removal action, weighs in favor of a finding that he intended to abandon his civilian career.[1] <span class="Italic">See Moravec,</span> 393 F.3d at 1268 (noting petitioner's failure to object to his separation from civilian service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The administrative judge also observed that the appellant has served in the military for over two decades, during which time he achieved the highest rank possible for a noncommissioned officer, and was awarded the Silver Star and the Army Commendation Medal for Valor. <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> MSPB Docket No. AT-3443-07 0016-I-2 (Initial Decision, Sept. 26, 2007). However, we find that the appellant's distinguished military service does not constitute evidence that he intended to abandon his civilian career.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When considered in isolation, the individual factors described above could be regarded as insufficient to support a finding that the appellant waived his USERRA rights. However, in our view, the circumstances presented in this case, considered together, are comparable to those our reviewing court has found sufficient to constitute a waiver of USERRA employment rights.[2] <span class="Italic">See Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1374-79; <span class="Italic">Gadue,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 17. Accordingly, we DENY the appellant's request for relief under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant contends that, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(2)(B), an employee may waive his USERRA rights only by knowingly providing written notice of his intent not to return to his civilian position after military service. This is incorrect. Section 4316(b)(2)(B) does not apply to USERRA rights in general; rather, it provides that an employee who knowingly gives such notice is ineligible for rights and benefits under &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1)(B), i.e., the "rights and benefits not determined by seniority as are generally provided by the employer of the person to employees having similar seniority, status, and pay who are on furlough or leave of absence under a contract, agreement, policy, practice, or plan." The appellant has not alleged that he was improperly denied such rights or benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Erickson returned to the Federal Circuit, and the result was that the court accepted his position that he did not abandon his civil service career in favor of the military. The court explained in <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 636 F.3d 1353, 1356-59 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 468, 2013 MSPB 101 (2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson argues that substantial evidence does not support the Board's finding that he abandoned his civilian career and therefore waived his USERRA protections. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We addressed the waiver doctrine, as applied to veterans' reemployment rights, in <span class="Italic">Woodman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 258 F.3d. 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Although that case was decided under USERRA's predecessor statute, the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act of 1974, both statutes draw the same distinction between career and noncareer service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1372. In <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> a civilian employee had left his civilian position in order to serve on active duty with the National Guard and had served for 14 years in that capacity. During that period, he "actively sought service extensions" and ultimately served long enough that he was eligible for retirement from the military. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1378. The Board held that the employee's actions justified an inference that he had abandoned his civilian job in favor of a career in the military. This court upheld that determination. We explained that the employee's actions "created a <span class="Italic">de <span id="Page_527"></span>facto</span> resignation by indicating to [his employer] that he never intended to return to his civilian position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1379.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Moravec v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 393 F.3d 1263 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and <span class="Italic">Dowling v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 393 F.3d 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2004), a pair of cases decided on the same day, we applied the waiver doctrine to federal employees' claims that their years of active duty service with the National Guard should count toward their years of federal service when computing their Civil Service Retirement Service annuity. In each case, the employee had held a civilian position with either the Army or the National Guard. Prior to beginning active duty service with the National Guard, each employee formally separated from his civilian position instead of asking to be placed on leave-without-pay status. Upon separation, each employee withdrew his personal contributions to his civilian retirement account. Following his separation from his civilian position, Mr. Moravec served for 16 years on active duty before rejoining the civilian workforce. Following his separation from civilian service, Mr. Dowling served for 12 years on active military duty. Each of them returned to work for his previous civilian employer after leaving active duty service. The Board determined that both employees had abandoned their civilian careers, and this court affirmed that determination. Because both Mr. Moravec and Mr. Dowling had abandoned their civilian careers, the years they spent with the National Guard were not creditable toward their civilian retirement accounts. <span class="Italic">Moravec,</span> 393 F.3d at 1266-68; <span class="Italic">Dowling,</span> 393 F.3d at 1263-64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reemployment provisions of section 4312 of USERRA apply only if the period of cumulative military service (excluding exempted periods) does not exceed five years. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a)(2). In <span class="Italic">Erickson I,</span> we held that the five-year cap for reemployment in section 4312 also applies to section 4311's antidiscrimination provision in situations such as Mr. Erickson's. We explained that the five-year limit applies where "the alleged discrimination consists of the employee's removal because of his military-related absence; otherwise, the five-year limit on an employer's obligation to rehire an employee who left work to serve in the military would be meaningless." 571 F.3d at 1369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, Mr. Erickson's period of military service did not exceed the five-year limit, taking into account the statutory exclusions. <span class="Italic">See Erickson I,</span> 571 F.3d at 1369-70. The Postal Service, however, apparently believed that his military service had exceeded the five-year period and predicated his removal on that assumption. Thus, the Postal Service's stated reason for removing Mr. Erickson--excessive use of military leave--was improper. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> By statute, he was entitled to retain his USERRA antidiscrimination and reemployment rights until the period of his military service exceeded the five-year cap. To be sure, even when an employee falls within the five-year period in which he would otherwise retain his USERRA rights, he may abandon his civilian career and the accompanying USERRA protections. <span class="Italic">See Moravec,</span> 393 F.3d at 1269. In that setting, however, abandonment can be found only if the circumstances demonstrate a clear intention on the employee's part to abandon his civilian career in favor of a career in the military.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board relied on three pieces of evidence to support its finding of abandonment: the length of the period that Mr. Erickson was away from his civilian position, his failure to contest his separation at the time he received the notice, and his expressed dissatisfaction with the Postal Service as compared to the military. When considered against the totality of the circumstances of this case, however, that evidence does not provide substantial support for the Board's conclusion that Mr. Erickson manifested a clear intention to abandon his civilian position with the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> the duration of an employee's military service is frequently relevant to the abandonment inquiry. The inquiry is a factual one, and there is no minimum period of military service that will trigger an assumption that the employee has decided to abandon his civilian position and thus waive his USERRA rights. The employee in <span class="Italic">Woodman</span> was in military service and away from his civilian position for 14 consecutive years. 258 F.3d at 1374. The employees in <span class="Italic">Moravec</span> and <span class="Italic">Dowling</span> were absent for 16 and 12 years, respectively. <span class="Italic">See Dowling,</span> 393 F.3d at 1261; <span class="Italic">Moravec,</span> 393 F.3d at 1265. Mr. Erickson was absent for nearly four consecutive years at one point and approximately two years at another point. Mr. Erickson's period of military service was considerably shorter than the periods held to support a finding of abandonment in <span class="Italic">Woodman, Moravec,</span> and <span class="Italic">Dowling.</span> Moreover, and importantly, Mr. Erickson's absence did not exceed the five-year statutory limit (taking exempted periods into account) at the time of his removal. Because the five-year period provides a distinct termination point for USERRA's reemployment rights, the enactment of that statutory period makes it reasonable to assume that, absent clear evidence to the contrary, employees who have not exceeded that period do not intend to abandon their civilian positions.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Like Mr. Erickson, Mr. Moravec had not exceeded USERRA's five-year limit on military service. 393 F.3d at 1267. However, Mr. Moravec was in a somewhat different position than Mr. Erickson. The bulk of Mr. Moravec's service occurred before 1994, the year in which USERRA was enacted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> USERRA's predecessor statute did not contain a five-year limit, and USERRA's five-year limit applied only prospectively from December 12, 1994. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that he intended to abandon his civilian career, the Board also relied on Mr. Erickson's failure to contest his removal for a period of six years. USERRA provides a window of time during which noncareer servicemembers must assert their section 4312 reemployment rights. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(e)(1). By contrast, there is no statutory timeframe during which a section 4311 discrimination claim must be asserted, and there is no statute of limitations on filing a USERRA complaint or claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4327(b). Congress thus plainly chose not to place a limit on the period within which a noncareer servicemember would be permitted to assert a claim under section 4311. Because an employee who is in military service retains his USERRA antidiscrimination rights despite the passage of time, an employee's failure to promptly challenge an adverse action by his employer should not be given undue weight in the abandonment inquiry. While an extensive delay in bringing a USERRA claim might offer some support for a conclusion that the employee has abandoned his USERRA rights<span class="Italic">, see Moravec,</span> 393 F.3d at 1268 (employee failed to contest his separation for 12 years), that factor is not entitled to substantial weight in this case, particularly in light of the fact that during most of the intervening period, Mr. Erickson was on active duty in an overseas military deployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board found Mr. Erickson's "expressed preference for military over civilian service especially significant" to its determination that he abandoned his career with the Postal Service. 113 M.S.P.R. at 44. While an employee's unequivocal statement that he intends to leave his civilian job permanently is perhaps the best evidence of an intention to abandon a civilian career (and thus waive USERRA's protections), Mr. Erickson's remarks fall far short of such an unequivocal expression of intent. His statement that he liked the military and did not like the way employees were treated in the Postal Service cannot be regarded as equivalent to an expression of intention to resign from his civilian position. That is particularly so in light of his testimony, not discredited by the Board, that when Ms. Warner asked him why he did not resign his position with the Postal Service, he replied that he believed his "job was at the post office."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Apart from the considerable difference in the length of Mr. Erickson's absence from his Postal Service position as compared with the length of the employees' absence in <span class="Italic">Moravec, Dowling,</span> or <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> there were other factors in those cases that strongly supported the Board's finding of abandonment. The employees in both <span class="Italic">Moravec</span> and <span class="Italic">Dowling</span> formally resigned their civilian positions and withdrew their personal retirement contributions when they left their civilian jobs. <span class="Italic">Moravec,</span> 393 F.3d at 1268; <span class="Italic">Dowling,</span> 393 F.3d at 1263. The employee in <span class="Italic">Woodman</span> manifested his election of a military career by remaining in active military service until he was eligible for full military retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1378. None of those factors was present in Mr. Erickson's case. In sum, while it was legitimate for the Board to consider evidence such as Mr. Erickson's failure to contest his removal immediately and his remarks to Ms. Warner, that evidence, viewed in context, is not sufficient to justify an inference that Mr. Erickson intended to abandon his civilian career. That is the case particularly in light of the fact that, at the time of his removal, he had not exceeded the five-year period set forth in USERRA during which an employee is entitled to continue in military service without losing his USERRA reemployment rights. We therefore vacate the Board's determination that Mr. Erickson abandoned his civilian career in favor of a career in military service, and we remand to the Board for further proceedings on Mr. Erickson's USERRA discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand to the administrative judge and a PFR, and after years of litigation, the Board entered an order directing reinstatement for Mr. Erickson, along with lost wages and benefits, <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 468, 473-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17, 2013 MSPB 101 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable remedial provision of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2), provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] has not complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board shall enter an order requiring the agency or Office to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that when the agency removed the appellant based on his use of military leave, it failed to comply with section 4311, which is a provision of USERRA relating to "employment."[4] We are therefore required by statute to enter an order requiring the agency to (1) comply with section 4311, and (2) compensate the appellant for any loss of wages or benefits suffered as a result of the wrongful removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The agency misquotes the statute as providing a remedy <span id="Page_528"></span>for violations of USERRA provisions "relating to the employment <span class="Italic">and</span> reemployment" of an individual. The statute in fact reads "employment <span class="Italic">or</span> reemployment." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2) (emphasis supplied). Hence, it is unnecessary for the appellant to demonstrate a violation of his reemployment rights in order to obtain relief under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("the word 'or' unambiguously signifies alternatives").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to bring itself into compliance with section 4311, the agency must necessarily cancel the removal action it took in violation of that section. The purpose of a Board order canceling an adverse personnel action is to place the appellant as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The effect of cancellation is to render the unlawful action null and void. <span class="Italic">Meier v. Department of the Interior</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 247, 258 (1980). Thus, as the administrative judge correctly found, the Board must order the appellant's restoration as of the effective date of the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's <span class="Italic">reinstatement</span> is not precluded by our reviewing court's finding that his <span class="Italic">reemployment</span> rights under section 4312 were not violated. Compliance with section 4311 requires reinstatement in this matter, which is separate from reemployment rights pursuant to section 4312. We therefore conclude the appellant's failure to timely apply for reemployment subsequent to December 31, 2005, has no bearing on the remedy for the agency's earlier violation of section 4311.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find the appellant's post-removal military service does not limit the period of time for which the appellant must be reinstated. While the agency was not required to hold the appellant's job for him indefinitely, it is undisputed that the appellant's nonexempted military absences did not exceed the 5-year limit at the time of his removal. <span class="Italic">Erickson I</span>, 571 F.3d at 1369-70. Furthermore, had the appellant completed only the military orders in effect at the time of his removal and not reenlisted, his nonexempted absences would still fall short of the 5-year limit, leaving his employment rights under USERRA intact. <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-3443-07-0016-I-1. Neither the court, nor the Board, has concluded that the appellant would have reenlisted had he not been improperly removed. In fact, the appellant has averred in an affidavit that he reenlisted to mitigate the damage caused by the agency's unlawful removal action. Moreover, we cannot conclude that, had the appellant not been unlawfully removed, his employment with the agency was bound to have ended at some later date, thereby curtailing the time for which he is entitled to reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Sink v. Department of Energy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 153, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22 (2008) (where the appellant involuntarily retired in the face of his impending removal for failure to accept a directed reassignment, the appropriate relief was to restore the appellant and provide back pay and benefits from the date of his retirement until the date he would otherwise have likely been separated from service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is also entitled under section 4324(c)(2) to lost wages and benefits suffered as a result of the agency's violation of section 4311. As guidance to the parties, we note that the general provisions of the Back Pay Act do not control the remedy that appellants may receive should they succeed on the merits of their USERRA claims. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Department of Justice</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 25 (2005). Because a service member is expected to exercise reasonable diligence to mitigate economic damages suffered as a result of an employer's violation of USERRA, the award of lost wages and benefits must be offset by the amount the appellant should have reasonably earned during the relevant period.[6] <span class="Italic">See</span> 70 Fed. Reg. 75246-01, 75257; <span class="Italic">cf. Graham v. Hall-McMillen Co., Inc</span>., 925 F. Supp. 437, 446 (N.D. Miss. 1996) (interpreting parallel remedial provision of the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;By contrast, the Back Pay Act does not require that a back pay award be offset by what an employee should have reasonably earned during the relevant period; rather, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596 requires only that an award of back pay be offset by amounts actually earned by the employee through other employment during the period at issue. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6; 8 n.5 (2001).</p>
