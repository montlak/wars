<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-158"><span class="space">5.</span> Amendment to Court Order Affecting Former Spouse Annuity; Construction of Annuity Interest Following Ineffective Amendment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">It is an understatement to describe as considerable the amount of litigation over the validity of court orders amending provisions in earlier divorce decrees that distributed annuity entitlements between the former husband and wife. The problems arise when a subsequent court order seeks to modify an earlier judicial decree to add, eliminate, or reduce a former spouse annuity. Following receipt of the new order from counsel to one of the parties to the court proceedings, OPM declines to accept the change and an appeal to MSPB ensues. The difficulties involving modification of court orders that originally allocate marital property interests spring from 5 USC 8341(h) (CSRS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4362"></span>(4)&#x2003;For purposes of this subchapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or Member concerned, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The counterpart for FERS is 5 USC 8445(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutes are implemented by 5 CFR 838.806 (2022) (the regulation previously had different section numbers within the OPM regulations; the regulation is part of 5 CFR Part 838, "Court Orders Affecting Retirement Benefits"):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Amended court orders</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if it is issued after the date of retirement or death of the employee and modifies or replaces the first order dividing the marital property of the employee or retiree and the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;For purposes of awarding, increasing, reducing, or eliminating a former spouse survivor annuity, or explaining, interpreting, or clarifying a court order that awards, increases, reduces or eliminates a former spouse survivor annuity, the court order must be--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death of the employee; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity and that is issued after the first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse has been vacated, set aside, or otherwise declared invalid is not a court order acceptable for processing if--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;It is issued after the date of retirement or death of the retiree;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;It changes any provision concerning a former spouse survivor annuity in the court order that was vacated, set aside or otherwise declared invalid; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)(i) The court order is effective prior to the date when it is issued; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The retiree and former spouse do not compensate the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for any uncollected annuity reduction due as a result of the court order vacating, setting aside, or otherwise invalidating the first order terminating the marital relationship between the retiree and the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;In this section, "date of retirement" means the later of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The date that the employee files an application for retirement; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The effective commencing date for the employee's annuity other than the commencing date of a phased retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;In this section, "issued" means actually filed with the clerk of the court, and does not mean the effective date of a retroactive court order that is effective prior to the date when actually filed with the clerk of the court (e.g., a court order issued nunc pro tunc).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1)&#x2003;In this section, the "first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The original written order that first ends (or first documents an oral order ending) the marriage if the court divides any marital property (or approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) in that order, or in any order issued before that order); or</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wiggins v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 579, 581-82 (1990), stated the rule governing the primacy of the first court order dividing annuity interests following divorce:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Direct payment of a portion of a retirement annuity may be made to a former spouse while the retiree is alive, "if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any court decree of divorce...or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1). A qualifying court order may also award a former spouse a survivor annuity. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.603 and 604. If issued after the date of retirement, the court order awarding a survivor annuity must be the first order terminating the marriage between the retiree and the former spouse. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(e)(2). In this case, there are two decrees terminating the appellant's marriage to the retiree, but only the second one provides her with an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM in both its initial decision and reconsideration decision distinguished between annuity apportionment, which it granted, and the right to a former spouse survivor annuity, which it denied. The administrative judge apparently overlooked the fact that OPM awarded the lifetime annuity apportionment and thus improperly adjudicated the appellant's right to such apportionment rather than her claim for a former spouse survivor annuity. It is therefore necessary to remand this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive issue before the Board is whether the first decree legally terminated the marriage, thereby preventing the appellant from receiving a former spouse survivor annuity as provided in the second decree. In its regulation OPM states that for purposes of awarding a former spouse annuity: "The 'first order terminating the marital relationship between the retiree and the former spouse' means the original written order that first ends...the marriage, and does not include (1) [a]ny order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets the original written order...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(e). Since the state judge "amended" the first decree rather than "vacating" it, there is a question regarding the validity and legal effect of the first decree. The appellant has provided a statement by the state judge which explains the case history and effect of the two decrees. The judge states that he initially erred in granting a divorce to the appellant and that the second decree is the one which legally terminated the marriage. On remand, the parties shall have the opportunity to present factual evidence and argument on this issue. Further, there is a question of whether, and if so, when, the first decree was filed with the state's clerk of the court, and if it was not, what effect the lack of filing has on its validity. Thus, on remand the parties should also have an opportunity to present further argument and evidence on this question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wiggins, supra,</span> also pointed out the need for the Board to seek intervention by the employee whose annuity interests are affected by the former spouse's claim for a survivor annuity, 43 MSPR at 582:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review OPM has renewed its request that the Board invite William Wiggins, the appellant's former spouse, to intervene in this case. OPM originally made this suggestion when it submitted its case file to the administrative judge. Although OPM submitted the agency file and intervenor request at the last minute, we find that the administrative judge erred in not responding to this request. A survivor benefit payable on a qualifying court order requires a corresponding reduction of the annuity of the retired employee. <span class="Italic">Leffler v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 624 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 879 F.2d 814 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Mugler v.

Since the outcome of this appeal could directly affect the rights and interests of Mr. Wiggins in regard to the amount of his annuity and his designation rights, and the record fails to indicate whether Mr. Wiggins otherwise received notice of the proceeding, the failure of the administrative judge to inform him of his right to intervene was prejudicial. Accordingly, on remand, the administrative judge should invite Mr. Wiggins to intervene.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">By statute, OPM may not honor a modification to a court order providing a former spouse survivor annuity if the modification is made after the retirement or death of the Federal employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a); <span class="Italic">Lim,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Griffin,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. at 72-73.

Therefore, we find that OPM correctly honored the 2005 order insofar as the 2005 order changed the apportionment of the retiree's annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most of the litigation over modifications in court orders occurs when the court orders are issued at or after the time of divorce of an employee who has earlier retired.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When Peter Kwan retired from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on August 2, 1995, he elected to receive a reduced annuity in order to provide survivor annuity benefits for the appellant, his then wife. Their marriage dissolved, effective December 15, 1998, pursuant to a stipulation recited into the record on that same date, as incorporated by a Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage Status Only, entered by the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda, on January 29, 1999. The January 29, 1999 judgment of dissolution bifurcated the proceedings and reserved for further determination all issues other than marital status. On January 5, 2000, the same court entered a Judgment on Reserved Issues, addressing Mr. Kwan's Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) pension, providing the following clause:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Findings</span>: The Court finds, based on the stipulation of the parties, that the community has an interest in [Mr. Kwan's] FAA pension, and that said value is 83.87% of the monthly gross value of $2,776.

The Court finds therefore that [the appellant's] share is $1,222.18 per month and [Mr. Kwan's] community and separate property shares total $1,553.82 per month. The Court further finds that [Mr. Kwan] has received the entire amount of the pension from and after the date of separation. [Mr. Kwan] has had exclusive use of this benefit since October 1, 1997. [The appellant] is entitled to a credit from [Mr. Kwan] in the amount of $1,222.18 per month for 25 months, for a total of $30,554.50 through and including October 1, 1999.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity is set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h), which Congress enacted as part of the Spouse Equity Act of 1984. <span class="Italic">Audet v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has issued regulations implementing the aforementioned provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.804(a), [a] court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it expressly awards a former spouse survivor annuity or expressly directs an employee or retiree to elect to provide such an annuity. Section 838.806, titled "Amended court orders," provides in subsection (a) that [a] court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if it is issued after the date of retirement or death of the employee and modifies or replaces the first order dividing the marital property of the employee or retiree and the former spouse. Section 838.806(b) provides, in relevant part, that for purposes of awarding a former spouse survivor annuity, the court order must be [i]ssued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of the death of the employee and must be [t]he first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(1), OPM defines the term first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse as meaning either: (i) The original written order that first ends (or first documents an oral order ending) the marriage if the court divides any marital property (or approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) in that order, or in any order issued before that order; or (ii) the original written order issued after the marriage has been terminated in which the court first divides any marital property (or first approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) if no marital property has been divided prior to the issuance of that order. OPM regulations provide that the first order dividing marital property does not include: (i) Any court order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets the original written order regardless of the effective date of the court order making the amendment, explanation, clarification, or interpretation; or (ii) [a]ny court order issued under reserved jurisdiction or any other court order issued subsequent to the original written order that divide[s] any marital property regardless of the effective date of the court order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(2); <span class="Italic">Short v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Short,</span> to which this case is akin, we agree with OPM that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), the November 21, 2001 Stipulation and Order for Division of CSRS Pension Benefits was a "modification" of the January 5, 2000 order, made after Mr. Kwan retired, <span id="Page_4364"></span>that rendered the court's award of a survivor annuity in that order ineffective. In <span class="Italic">Short,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-17, the Board found controlling the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 262 F.3d 1280, 1284-87 (Fed. Cir. 2001), which addressed the issue of whether a divorce decree that divides marital property, but defers [d]ivision of community interest in the Federal Employee's Civil Service Pension so long as spousal support payments are made and does not award a survivor annuity, is modified by a subsequent order that does award such an annuity. <span class="Italic">Short,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 11. As set forth in <span class="Italic">Short</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The court [in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro</span>] held that when a divorce decree provides that matters relating to property division are reserved for future consideration and judicial disposition, the divorce proceedings are bifurcated, and the subsequent proceeding divides marital property, including civil service retirement annuity benefits, and provides for a survivor annuity in the manner required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and the pertinent regulations, there is no conflict with 5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(4), i.e., no modification of a section 8341(h)(1) decree, because there is one, and only one, decree that divides marital property. [262 F.3d] at 1287.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The court held, on the other hand, that "a decree that divides marital property, including retirement benefits, without expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity cannot be altered after the employee's death [or retirement] by a court order that purports to award such an annuity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court found that such a court order runs afoul of the provision of &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) because it constitutes a prohibited modification of the original decree, and that it is a prohibited modification of the original decree because it alters the terms of the original decree (by adding something "a survivor annuity" to those terms), and because it comes after the death of the employee and involve a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the first court order, dated January 5, 2000: (1) Did not meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and OPM's regulations for the express provision of a survivor annuity; (2) divided certain items of marital property; (3) deferred a formal division of Mr. Kwan's pension benefits, thereby retaining jurisdiction over the matter; and (4) characterized the appellant's monthly payment as nothing more than a monthly benefit payment <span class="Italic">See Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287; <span class="Italic">Short,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 14. Thus, it is clear that a survivor annuity was not expressly provided for in the terms of the January 5, 2000 order. Moreover, the November 2001 domestic relations order changed the January 5, 2000 order because it added a survivor annuity to an order that: (1) Divided various specified items of marital property; (2) provided for a monthly payment of a retroactive apportionment of Mr. Kwan's retirement annuity; (3) deferred division of the remainder of the retirement annuity and retained jurisdiction over the issue; and (4) made no mention of a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287; <span class="Italic">Short,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A decree that divides marital property, including retirement benefits, without expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity cannot be altered by a court order that purports to award such an annuity. <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287; <span class="Italic">Short,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 14. The January 5, 2000 order in this case divided marital property, including retirement benefits, without expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity. It could not, therefore, be altered by the November 21, 2001 domestic relations order that purported to award such an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Short,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 14. Thus, OPM did not err in rejecting the appellant's argument that she was entitled to a survivor annuity based on the November 2001 order.<span class="Italic"> See Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1284-87.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note the appellant's attempt to distinguish this appeal from <span class="Italic">Vaccaro</span> by arguing that the November 2001 court order that awarded a survivor annuity in this case was issued after Mr. Kwan' s retirement, not his death. Such a claim was expressly rejected by <span class="Italic">Short</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 15, where the Board noted that [t]his difference is immaterial because a modification in a decree, order, or agreement shall not be effective if the modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee concerned.5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4); <span class="Italic">Short,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 15 (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the November 21, 2001 Stipulation and Order for Division of CSRS Pension Benefits, which first awarded the appellant a survivor annuity, is ineffective because it is a modification of the January 5, 2000 Judgment on Reserved Issues that was made after Mr. Kwan retired and that involved an annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4); <span class="Italic">Short</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 17.

<p class="Body-Text">Referenced in <span class="Italic">Eng-Kwan, supra,</span> was <span class="Italic">Vaccaro v. OPM</span>, 262 F.3d 1280, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The parties' first divorce order dealt with marital property and the second order improperly sought to modify the earlier decree through an attempt by the later court order to add a survivor annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Love</span> [<span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1992)], a divorce decree provides that matters relating to property division are reserved for future consideration and judicial disposition, the divorce proceedings are bifurcated. In such a case, when the subsequent proceedings divide marital property, including civil service retirement annuity benefits, and provide for a survivor annuity in the manner required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and the pertinent OPM regulations, there is no conflict with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). The reason is that there is no "modification" of a &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) decree. That is because there is one, and only one, decree that divides marital property. <span class="Italic">See Love,</span> 962 F.2d at 1011 ("An initial court order dividing marital property, such as the orders in this case, does not change, alter or limit the terms or effect of the previously entered decree of divorce, which dissolved the marriage. The initial property order does not change, alter or limit anything."). On the other hand, a decree that divides marital property, including retirement benefits, without expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity cannot be altered after the employee's death by a court order that purports to award such an annuity. Such a court order runs afoul of the provisions of &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) because it constitutes a prohibited modification of the original decree. It is a prohibited modification of the original decree because it alters the terms of the original decree (by adding something--a survivor annuity--to those terms), and because it comes "after the...death of the employee" and "involves" a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hokanson,</span> 122 F.3d at 1047.<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case<span class="Italic">,</span> the 1996 decree did not meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and OPM's regulations for the express provision of survivor annuity. The 1996 decree divided certain items of marital property. At the same time, the court deferred a division of Mr. Vaccaro's "Civil Service Pension" and retained jurisdiction over the Pension to ensure that Mr. Vaccaro paid Ms. Vaccaro her monthly "spousal support" of $300. The court characterized Ms. Vaccaro's monthly payment as "her share of the community interest in the retirement." Thus, it is clear that, in the words of the statute, a survivor annuity was not "expressly provided for" in the terms of the 1996 decree. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1997 order changed the 1996 decree. It did so because it added a survivor annuity to a decree that (I) divided various specified items of marital property; (ii) provided for a monthly payment of a portion of Mr. Vaccaro's retirement annuity; (iii) deferred division of the retirement annuity and retained jurisdiction over it in order to ensure that Mr. Vaccaro kept up his monthly payments to Ms. Vaccaro; and (iv) made no mention of a survivor annuity. The 1997 order was ineffective as a matter of law under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) because it modified the 1996 decree after Mr. Vaccaro's death by providing a survivor annuity when the 1996 decree made no mention of such an annuity. Accordingly, OPM did not err in rejecting Ms. Vaccaro's argument that she was entitled to a survivor annuity based upon the 1997 order.</p>

The court declined to disturb a Board decision declining to require OPM to implement a later court order seeking to readjust and diminish the survivor annuity based on the length of the marriage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose for which the parties sought a change in the original court order, however, cannot alter the meaning of that order or avoid the statutory provision that a modification in a divorce order will not be effective if made after the employee retires or dies. Here, as we have shown, the 1994 order clearly and unequivocally awarded Mills the maximum possible former spouse's civil service retirement annuity. Moran's argument would require OPM to engage in the very kind of analysis and evaluation of state law that that agency's regulations state OPM should avoid. The Board properly affirmed OPM's refusal to consider the 1999 order because that order was an ineffective modification of the 1994 order.</p>

No matter what label is used to characterize the 2010 court order, two things are clear: the order issued after Mr. Siders's death, and it amended--i.e., modified--the 1996 order by adding language about a survivor annuity that was absent from the original order.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Audet v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 628, 630-36 &#x00B6; 2-4, 6, 10-19 (2003), declared improper a retroactive replacement of a divorce decree that specifically provided for a former spouse survivor annuity, when the original decree made a more general provision for division of the employee's retirement benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The intervenor retired under CSRS on August 1, 1991. On February 26, 2001, the court rendered a Judgment of Divorce that divided marital property between him and the appellant. The Judgment of Divorce awarded the appellant a portion of "any retirement or pension benefit belonging to" the intervenor, stated that the parties would submit a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) to the court for signature "to effectuate this provision," and retained jurisdiction to enter the QDRO. The April 24, 2001 QDRO awarded the appellant a former spouse survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 16, 2001, the appellant applied for benefits, including a former spouse survivor annuity, based on the intervenor's federal service. OPM found, however, that the QDRO awarding the former spouse survivor annuity was a prohibited modification of the Judgment of Divorce under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) because it was issued after the intervenor's retirement and was not the first order dividing marital property. Thus, OPM would not honor the former spouse survivor annuity award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of this, the appellant filed a motion with the court to correct the "clerical error" in the Judgment of Divorce. The court granted the motion on September 10, 2001, stating that it intended the appellant to have a survivor annuity and that language to that effect was "inadvertently omitted" from the Judgment of Divorce. It entered a second Judgment of Divorce "to replace, as an original Judgment of Divorce, the previous Judgment." It stated that the new order was "effective nunc pro tunc to February 26, 2001." The second Judgment of Divorce included the following paragraph that was not included in the first Judgment of Divorce: "Under Section 8341(h)(1), Title 5 U.S. Code, [the appellant] is awarded a Former Spouse Survivor Annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The amount of the Former Spouse Survivor Annuity will be equal to thirty-two and one-half percent (32.5%) of [the intervenor's] Employee Annuity."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the AJ found that a court has the inherent authority to correct clerical mistakes in judgments. He found that the court's corrective action rendered the uncorrected Judgment of Divorce void ab initio, and, thus, that the Judgment of Divorce had not been amended, explained, clarified, interpreted, or otherwise modified. He therefore concluded that the "corrected" Judgment of Divorce, as the original written order that first ended the marriage while dividing marital property, was a court order acceptable for processing (COAP) and must be honored by OPM. I.D. at 7. The initial decision notified the parties that it would become final on October 24, 2002, unless a PFR were filed by that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the AJ erred in finding that the second Judgment of Divorce, entered on September 10, 2001, was a COAP. It asserts, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the second Judgment of Divorce was a prohibited replacement of the first Judgment of Divorce that divided marital property. We agree with OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity is set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h), which Congress enacted as part of the Spouse Equity Act of 1984. <span class="Italic">See Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008, 1009 (Fed. Cir. 1992). That statute provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(h)(1)&#x2003;Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5) of this subsection, a former spouse of a[n] annuitant is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;For purposes of this subchapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee concerned, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement that such a benefit be "expressly provided" is substantive, and not a mere technicality. <span class="Italic">Hokanson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 122 F.3d 1043, 1047 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The intent to provide the survivor annuity must be clear, definite, explicit, plain, direct, and unmistakable, not dubious or ambiguous. <span class="Italic">E.g., Hahn v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 154, 156 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When enacting the Spouse Equity Act, Congress empowered OPM to prescribe regulations that are necessary and proper to carry out the Act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a); <span class="Italic">Love,</span> 962 F.2d at 1013. OPM has interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806 governing amended court orders. Subsection (a) of the regulation specifically states that a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a COAP "if it is issued after [the employee's] date of retirement or death" and "modifies or <span class="Italic">replaces</span> the first order dividing the marital property of the employee and the former spouse." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a) (emphasis supplied). Here, the second Judgment of Divorce was undisputedly issued after the intervenor's retirement. Moreover, the court's own September 10, 2001 order, granting the appellant's "Emergency Motion to Correct Clerical Error," stated that the second Judgment of Divorce was "hereby entered <span class="Italic">to replace</span>, as an original Judgment of Divorce, the previous Judgment." Accordingly, the second Judgment of Divorce is not a COAP under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(c) states that a court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity and that is "issued" after the first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse "has been vacated, set aside, or otherwise declared invalid, is not a" COAP if it is issued after the date of retirement, changes any provision concerning a former spouse survivor annuity in the previous court order, and is effective prior to the date when it is "issued." Subsection (e) defines "issued" as "actually filed with the clerk of the court, and does not mean the effective date of a retroactive court order that is effective prior to the date when actually filed with the clerk of the court (<span class="Italic">e.g., a court order issued nunc pro tunc</span>)." (Emphasis supplied.) Here, the second Judgment of Divorce added a provision to the first Judgment of Divorce by adding the paragraph providing the appellant with a former spouse survivor annuity. Further, despite its February 26, 2001 date, it was not actually filed with the clerk of the court until September 10, 2001. Thus, it was effective prior to the date when it was "issued." Accordingly, it is not a COAP under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ cited the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as the basis for the court's inherent authority to correct "clerical mistakes" in judgments. While the Board may look to those rules for guidance, it is not bound by them. <span class="Italic">E.g., Crickard v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6; 25 (2002). In any event, the appellant must meet the statutory requirements for the award of a former spouse survivor annuity.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a), (c). The Board may not order the payment of federal retirement benefits when the statutory conditions for such benefits have not been met. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the first Judgment of Divorce, the court found that the parties had marital personal property and divided it, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The appellant] is awarded one half of the marital portion of any retirement or pension benefit belonging to [the intervenor] . The marital portion of the retirement plan is to be determined by dividing the number of months of marriage while [the intervenor] was employed by the total number of months employed, that is 221/337 or 65%. The parties shall submit a Qualified Domestic Relations Order to this court for signature to effectuate this provision. [The appellant] shall be responsible for drafting the QDRO by March 15, 2001. The court shall retain jurisdiction to enter such Order. The remaining one half interest in the marital portion of the plan is awarded to the owner. The remainder is set aside to the owner as non-marital property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That provision did not satisfy the statutory standard because it does not "expressly provide[&#8197;] for" a survivor annuity for the appellant. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Hokanson,</span> 122 F.3d at 1047 (stating that an award of a former spouse survivor annuity must be express). Rather, it awards a portion of the "retirement or pension benefit" or "the retirement plan" <span id="Page_4366"></span>belonging to the intervenor. In <span class="Italic">Hokanson,</span> the court found that the regulations specifically distinguish between the payment of a share of a federal employee's retirement benefits to a former spouse during the lifetime of the retired federal employee, and the award of a survivor annuity to the former spouse payable after the death of the employee.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1045-46. It thus stated that an award directing the payment of a share of "a federal employee's retirement benefits is distinct from, and will not be interpreted as, an award of a survivor annuity."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1046; <span class="Italic">see also Walker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (finding that OPM's regulatory definition of "employee retirement benefits" does not include survivor annuities); <span class="Italic">Holzman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 254, 258-59 (1994) (finding that a divorce decree that provided for the receipt of a portion of the retirement benefits did not expressly provide for the receipt of a survivor annuity),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 48 F.3d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Accordingly, we will not interpret the first Judgment of Divorce's award of a portion of the "retirement or pension benefit" or "the retirement plan" in this case to include an award of a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Hokanson,</span> 122 F.3d at 1047;<span class="Italic"> Hahn,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 156; <span class="Italic">see also Pitsker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 4 (2001) (finding it well settled that decisions of the Federal Circuit constitute precedent that is binding on the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the first Judgment of Divorce can be read as deferring a decision on retirement benefits until the QDRO was entered, the orders are likewise ineffective to make such an award. In <span class="Italic">Vaccaro v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 262 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the court addressed the issue of whether a 1996 divorce decree that divided marital property, but deferred the "[d]ivision of community interest in the Federal Employee's Civil Service Pension" and did not award a former spouse survivor annuity, was modified by a subsequent 1997 order that did award such an annuity.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1284-85. The court held that the 1996 decree did not meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and OPM's regulations for the express provision of a survivor annuity. It further found that the 1997 order was ineffective as a matter of law under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) because it modified the 1996 decree after Mr. Vaccaro's death by providing a survivor annuity when the 1996 decree made no mention of such an annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1287.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the QDRO in this case constituted a prohibited modification of the first Judgment of Divorce under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(b). The first Judgment of Divorce divided marital property and made no mention of a former spouse survivor annuity; the QDRO was issued after the intervenor's retirement, and the QDRO involved a survivor annuity award. As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Moran v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 310 F.3d 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2002), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) "is clear" in stating that a modification is ineffective if issued after the federal employee's retirement and "it contains no exceptions."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1383-85 (holding that OPM properly refused to accept a 1999 order nunc pro tunc that changed the basis for determining the former spouse's survivor annuity since it was a modification of a 1994 order and was issued after the employee had retired).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of proving entitlement to a survivor annuity is on the applicant for benefits. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lim v. OPM</span>, 98 MSPR 173, 176-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (2005), determined that a subsequent court order could not add a survivor annuity when the first divorce decree addressed annuity interests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...&#8197;As set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h), "a former spouse...is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent <span class="Italic">expressly</span> provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) (emphasis added).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, a "modification" in a decree, order, or agreement referred to in section 8341(h)(1) shall not be effective if the modification is made after the retirement of the employee concerned and "to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). In other words, as explained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if it is issued <span class="Italic">after the date of retirement</span> or death of the employee and <span class="Italic">modifies or replaces the first order dividing the marital property</span> of the employee or retiree and the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(2) (expressly excluding from the definition of "first order dividing marital property...[a]ny court order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets the original written order regardless of the effective date of the court order making the amendment, clarification, or interpretation"). As noted by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, "a decree that divides marital property, including retirement benefits, without expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity cannot be altered after the employee's death [or retirement] by a court order that purports to award such an annuity." <span class="Italic">Vaccaro v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the first court order dissolving the marriage and distributing the marital property specifically awarded to the wife, among other things, one-half of her former husband's monthly retirement annuity and one-half of the balance of his Federal Thrift Savings Plan account. At no point did the order mention, nor did it expressly reserve disposition of, a survivor annuity. Although the appellant contends that the original order implicitly decreed that she was entitled to a survivor annuity, such an "implicit" decree, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that one exists in the document, would fail to satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). Because the original order dividing marital property, including retirement benefits, did not expressly provide for a former spouse retirement annuity, OPM correctly determined that the appellant was not entitled to the annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, because the original order did not expressly provide for (or reserve disposition of) a survivor annuity, the appellant may not procure a survivor annuity through a subsequent court order without violating the restrictions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). <span class="Italic">See Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287. The subsequent court order and QDROs provided by the appellant on petition for review, constitute modifications of the original decree which are ineffective for purposes of awarding a former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), and therefore, OPM lacks the discretion to award the appellant a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nicholson v. OPM</span>, 64 MSPR 340, 341-43 (1994), determined that there was no unlawful modification of a divorce decree that referred to a survivor annuity for a former spouse and a later court order that made the reference more explicit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was married to Bernard Nicholson (Nicholson) on December 15, 1956. Nicholson retired from federal service on May 1, 1987, and at that time elected to receive a reduced annuity in order to provide for survivor benefits for the appellant. The appellant and Nicholson were divorced on September 24, 1991. Their divorce decree stated that the appellant "waives any marital interest claim in Plaintiff's [i.e., her husband Nicholson's] current pension" but "reserves her survivor benefits in Plaintiff's pension." One year later, the appellant and Nicholson obtained from the court a revision of their divorce decree that stated that the appellant "is hereby awarded complete survivor benefits in the Plaintiff's, Bernard G. Nicholson's, civil service retirement benefits, payment to be made directly to Frances N. Nicholson by the United States Office of Personnel Management following the death of Bernard G. Nicholson, provided the said Frances N. Nicholson survives the said Bernard G. Nicholson." Nicholson died on January 30, 1983.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied the appellant's request for survivor annuity benefits on the basis that the divorce decree only reserved "survivor benefits" in Nicholson's pension but did not specify "Civil Service Retirement System." OPM ruled that the revised court order was an impermissible modification of the original decree and thus did not consider it....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Spouse Equity Act provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a former spouse of a deceased employee...is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent <span class="Italic">expressly provided for</span> in an election under section 8339(j)(3) of this title, or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) (emphasis added). The statute also provides that "a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election...shall not be effective if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee...to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). Both OPM and the administrative judge found that the appellant's divorce decree did not expressly provide for a survivor annuity because it did not state that the annuity it referred to was part of the Civil Service Retirement System or pertained to Nicholson's federal service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with this overly narrow reading of the appellant's divorce decree. We find that the appellant's original divorce decree was explicit enough to establish her entitlement to a survivor annuity. Because of this finding, we need not address OPM's and the administrative judge's second finding that the revised court order was an impermissible modification of the original divorce decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4367"></span>The Board has interpreted the "expressly provided for" requirement of the statute as precluding the Board or OPM from undertaking its own determination of spousal entitlements and awarding survivor benefits based on uncertain or ambiguous state court orders. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 651, 654 and n.3 (1991). There is thus no entitlement to a survivor annuity when a divorce decree is silent or ambiguous on the subject. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Price v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 35, 37 (1991) (divorce decree was silent as to survivor benefit); <span class="Italic">Summers v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 657, 660 (1991) (same); <span class="Italic">Bottrell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 338, 342 (1988) (language in divorce decree could be read to provide either a survivor annuity or a lump-sum benefit and was thus ambiguous), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 867 F.2d 1421 (Fed. Cir. 1989). At the same time, the Board has also held that the "expressly provided for" provision does not require the use of certain "magic words" in order to establish an entitlement to a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Holzman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 254, 257 (1994); <span class="Italic">Bliznik v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's divorce decree was not silent or ambiguous about her entitlement to a survivor annuity. On the contrary, the decree expressly states that she "reserves her survivor benefits in [her husband's] pension" while "waiv[ing] any marital interest claim in [his] current pension." The appellant's husband worked for the federal government for 30 years, and his only pension was that provided under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). The appellant's decree is specifically written to dispose separately of the only retirement benefits that her husband had, in accordance with his election at the time of his retirement: his reduced annuity while he lived and her survivor benefits when he died. There is no confusion here, as there was in <span class="Italic">Bottrell</span> and <span class="Italic">Holzman</span>, for example, as to whether the divorce decree was apportioning her husband's retirement benefits while he lived or awarding a lump-sum benefit as opposed to a survivor annuity. Requiring, as the administrative judge and OPM would, specific reference in the decree to the CSRS or to Nicholson's federal service amounts to requiring the use of "magic words" to effect the parties' intention in this case. Such a requirement elevates form over substance, in frustration of the Congressional purpose in enacting the Spouse Equity Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bliznik</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 344; <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 656.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that because the divorce decree conforms to the statutory requirement, the appellant has demonstrated her entitlement to a survivor annuity.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and Mr. Jimmie Short married on May 1, 1976. Mr. Short retired from the Federal service on August 3, 2000. Upon retirement, he elected an annuity payable only during his lifetime, to which the appellant consented.<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant and Mr. Short divorced later that year, with the District Court, County of Pueblo, State of Colorado, issuing a decree dissolving their marriage on December 1, 2000. The December 2000 decree incorporated a November 21, 2000 court-ordered separation agreement that contained the following clause:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">20 (C).&#x2003;The equal division of Respondent's retirement account with the U.S. Government, Department of Transportation shall be accomplished with a Qualified Domestic Relations Order or its equivalent. Until such time as the formal Division of Respondent's retirement account is accomplished, Respondent agrees to pay to Petitioner one-half (1/2) of the net amount that he receives as a retirement payment for the U.S. Government, Department of Transportation. During this interim period of time, the Respondent shall be responsible for any and all income tax obligation relating to the receipt of the retirement funds. When the formal division of the retirement account has been accomplished, Petitioner shall be responsible for the income taxes relating to those retirement funds that are paid to her pursuant to the division of this account, whereas Respondent shall be responsible for the income taxes relating to retirement funds paid directly to him. In determining the net amount of the retirement payment to Petitioner prior to the formal division of this asset, the only deductions from the gross amount shall be for Federal income tax withholding, state income tax withholding and FICA. Any insurance payments which are for the benefit of Respondent shall not be subtracted from the gross amount. The parties understand that the gross amount of the retirement payment to Respondent will be approximately $4,000.00 per month.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The November 21, 2000 separation agreement, which was incorporated into the divorce decree, also provided for spousal maintenance and divided the appellant's and Mr. Short's real property and personal property, including clothing, jewelry, bank accounts, automobiles, and other possessions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 7, 2001, the District Court, Pueblo County, Colorado, issued a "Domestic Relations Order Concerning Civil Service Retirement Systems (CSRS)" that awarded the appellant fifty percent of Mr. Short's gross monthly annuity under the CSRS, and "the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity" under the CSRS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM issued an initial decision awarding the appellant fifty percent of Mr. Short's gross annuity benefit, but finding that "[y]our court order did not award you a former spouse survivor annuity in the first order that divided property between you and Mr. Short," and informing her that her benefit will, therefore, terminate upon Mr. Short's death. Upon reconsideration of the denial of a former spouse survivor annuity, OPM found that the appellant was not entitled to such an annuity because: (1) The December 1, 2000 divorce decree did not expressly award a former spouse survivor annuity, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.804; and (2) the domestic relations order, dated March 7, 2001, was not acceptable for processing because, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806, it modified or replaced the first order dividing the marital property and was issued after Mr. Short's retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the Board the appellant asserted that the March 7, 2001 domestic relations order was not a modification of the original decree terminating the appellant's marriage, but was instead merely a "completion" of the division of property. Based on the written record, because the appellant waived her right to a hearing, the Board's administrative judge (AJ) reversed OPM's reconsideration decision. The AJ found that OPM erred in concluding that the March 2001 court order was an improper modification of the initial divorce decree under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(e). The AJ found that this case was controlled instead by <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 67 (1999), where the Board held that there was no disqualifying modification in that case within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4).<span class="Italic"></span> The AJ held that here, as in <span class="Italic">Griffin,</span> the initial divorce decree ended the marriage and divided some marital property, but specifically reserved the matter of the final division of retirement benefits to be addressed in a subsequent domestic relations order, which expressly provided for a former spouse survivor annuity. Thus, the AJ found that the appellant was entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity, and reversed OPM's determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has filed a timely petition for review of the initial decision, arguing that this case is controlled by <span class="Italic">Vaccaro v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 262 F.3d 1280, 1284-87 (Fed. Cir. 2001), which OPM claims supports a finding that the March 2001 court order in this case was an invalid modification of the December 2000 divorce decree that is not acceptable for processing by OPM. The appellant has filed a timely response to the petition for review, asserting that <span class="Italic">Vaccaro</span> is distinguishable from this appeal, and that the initial decision is correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse of a deceased employee is entitled to a survivor annuity "if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). Nevertheless, a "modification" in a decree, order, or agreement referred to in subsection 8341(h)(1) shall not be effective if the modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee concerned, and "to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has issued regulations implementing the above provisions. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.804(a), a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it expressly awards a former spouse survivor annuity or expressly directs an employee or retiree to elect to provide such an annuity. Section 838.806, titled "Amended court orders," provides in subsection (a) that "[a] court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing if it is issued after the date of retirement or death of the employee and modifies or replaces the first order dividing the marital property of the employee or retiree and the former spouse." Section 838.806(b) provides, in relevant part, that for purposes of awarding a former spouse survivor annuity, the court order must be issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of the death of the employee, and must be "the first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and <span id="Page_4368"></span>the former spouse." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(1), OPM defines the term "first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse" as meaning either: (i) The original written order that first ends (or first documents an oral order ending) the marriage if the court divides any marital property (or approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) in that order, or in any order issued before that order; or (ii) the original written order issued after the marriage has been terminated in which the court first divides any marital property (or first approves a property settlement agreement that divides any marital property) if no marital property has been divided prior to the issuance of that order. OPM's regulations provide that the first order dividing marital property does not include: (i) Any court order that amends, explains, clarifies, or interprets the original written order regardless of the effective date of the court order making the amendment, explanation, clarification, or interpretation; or (ii) any court order issued under reserved jurisdiction or any other court order issued subsequent to the original written order that divides any marital property regardless of the effective date of the court order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), as interpreted by the court in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> the March 2001 domestic relations order in this case was a "modification" of the December 2000 divorce decree, made after Mr. Short retired, that rendered the court's award of a survivor annuity in that order ineffective. In<span class="Italic"> Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1282, the court found that the Vaccaros married in 1974, and Mr. Vaccaro retired from Federal service in 1981. On August 9, 1996, the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Del Norte, entered a judgment of dissolution of the Vaccaros' marriage. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The judgment stated that the parties were "ordered to comply with the terms and provisions of attachment '3.g.,'" which was a marital property agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The marital property agreement listed the community property of the Vaccaros on the date of their separation, including "Community interest in husband's postal retirement," and proceeded to divide the community property. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Mr. Vaccaro's civil service retirement was addressed as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Division of community interest in the Federal Employee's Civil Service Pension is deferred so long as Respondent pays to Petitioner as and for spousal support the sum of not less than Three Hundred ($300) Dollars per month. The court retains jurisdiction over this asset to insure [Ms. Vaccaro] receives her share of the community interest in the retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1282-83. After Mr. Vaccaro died on March 7, 1997, the California court awarded Ms. Vaccaro a former spouse survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1283. The court's March 25, 1997 order stated, in pertinent part, "[h]aving reserved jurisdiction over Respondent's Federal Employee Civil Service Pension, the court hereby awards to Petitioner all benefits as surviving spouse...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied Ms. Vaccaro's application for a survivor annuity, relying on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)-(4) and OPM's implementing regulations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM informed Ms. Vaccaro that her divorce decree did not award her a survivor annuity or direct Mr. Vaccaro to elect such an annuity for her, and that the March 25, 1997 court order "is not qualifying for awarding you a former spouse survivor annuity since it was issued after the first court order that divided marital property between you and Mr. Vaccaro," and because it was issued after Mr. Vaccaro's death. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On appeal, the Board's AJ sustained OPM's reconsideration decision, finding it in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1283-84. The AJ's initial decision became the final decision of the Board when a divided full Board denied Ms. Vaccaro's petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1284.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, a majority of the court affirmed. After setting out the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)-(4), the court noted that the 1996 divorce decree clearly did not award Ms. Vaccaro a survivor annuity, and that the 1997 order of the California court was entered after Mr. Vaccaro's death and "involved an annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1284. The court framed the issue before it as whether "a divorce decree that divides marital property, but defers '[d]ivision of community interest in the Federal Employee's Civil Service Pension' so long as spousal support payments are made and does not award a survivor annuity, is modified by a subsequent order that does award such an annuity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1285. The court then reviewed in detail its prior decisions addressing the statutory provisions at issue in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> namely, <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and <span class="Italic">Hokanson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 122 F.3d 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1997). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1285-86. The court held that when, as in <span class="Italic">Love,</span> a divorce decree provides that matters relating to property division are reserved for future consideration and judicial disposition, the divorce proceedings are bifurcated, and the subsequent proceeding divides marital property, including civil service retirement annuity benefits, and provides for a survivor annuity in the manner required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and the pertinent regulations, there is no conflict with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), i.e., no "modification" of a section 8341(h)(1) decree, because "there is one, and only one, decree that divides marital property." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1287.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held, on the other hand, that "a decree that divides marital property, including retirement benefits, without expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity cannot be altered after the employee's death [or retirement] by a court order that purports to award such an annuity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court found that such a court order "runs afoul of the provisions of &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) because it constitutes a prohibited modification of the original decree," and that it is a prohibited modification of the original decree "because it alters the terms of the original decree (by adding something--a survivor annuity--to those terms), and because it comes 'after the death of the employee' and 'involves' a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> the court found that: (1) The 1996 decree did not meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and OPM's regulations for the express provision of a survivor annuity; (2) the 1996 decree divided certain items of marital property; (3) at the same time, the state court deferred a division of Mr. Vaccaro's "Civil Service Pension" and retained jurisdiction over the Pension to ensure that Mr. Vaccaro paid Ms. Vaccaro her monthly "spousal support"; and (4) the state court characterized Ms. Vaccaro's monthly payment as "her share of the community interest in the retirement." Thus, the court held that it was clear that a survivor annuity was not "expressly provided for" in the terms of the 1996 decree. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court further found that the 1997 state court order changed the 1996 decree because it added a survivor annuity to a decree that: (1) Divided various specified items of marital property; (2) provided for a monthly payment of a portion of Mr. Vaccaro's retirement annuity; (3) deferred division of the retirement annuity and retained jurisdiction over it in order to ensure that Mr. Vaccaro kept up his monthly payments to Ms. Vaccaro; and (4) made no mention of a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court concluded that the 1997 order was ineffective as a matter of law under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) because it "modified the 1996 decree after Mr. Vaccaro's death by providing a survivor annuity when the 1996 decree made no mention of such an annuity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in this case are substantially similar to those set forth by the court in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro.</span> Here, like <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> the first court order, a December 1, 2000 divorce decree that incorporated a November 2000 separation agreement: (1) Did not meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and OPM's regulations for the express provision of a survivor annuity; (2) divided certain items of marital property; (3) deferred a formal division of Mr. Short's "retirement account," thereby retaining jurisdiction over the matter; and (4) characterized the appellant's monthly payment as the "retirement payment to Petitioner." Thus, it is clear that a survivor annuity was not "expressly provided for" in the terms of the December 1, 2000 divorce decree. Moreover, the March 7, 2001 domestic relations order, like the 1997 court order in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> changed the December 2000 divorce decree because it added a survivor annuity to a decree that: (1) Divided various specified items of marital property; (2) provided for a monthly payment of a portion of Mr. Short's retirement annuity; (3) deferred division of the retirement annuity and retained jurisdiction over it; and (4) made no mention of a survivor annuity. As the court held in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287, a decree that divides marital property, including retirement benefits, without "expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity cannot be altered by a court order that purports to award such an annuity." The December 2000 divorce decree in this case divided marital property, including retirement benefits, without expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity. It could not, therefore, be altered by the March 7, 2001 domestic relations order that purported to award such an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> the court order that awarded a survivor annuity in this case was issued after Mr. Short's retirement, not his death. This difference, however, is immaterial because a modification in a decree, order, or agreement shall not be effective if the modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee concerned. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). We also note that the 1996 decree in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro</span> provided that the division of community interest in Mr. Vaccaro's Civil Service Pension would be "deferred" as long as he paid to Ms. Vaccaro spousal support in the sum of not less than three hundred dollars per month, while the December 2000 divorce decree in this case, incorporating the November 2000 separation agreement, provided that the equal division of Mr. Short's retirement account "shall be accomplished" with a Qualified Domestic Relations Order or its equivalent. This minor difference in the nature of the deferral of the division of the retirement benefits does not distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Vaccaro.</span> There is no indication in the majority's decision in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro</span> that it was basing its determination on the nature of the deferral, rather than on the fact that the first court order did not expressly provide for, or reserve disposition of, a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the AJ's reliance on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> was misplaced. A majority of the Board found in <span class="Italic">Griffin,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. at 74 n.4, that OPM's regulation implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)-(4), i.e., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004, did not apply in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> because section 838.1004 did not become effective until 1992, after the 1990 court orders at issue in <span class="Italic">Griffin.</span> As set forth above, sections 838.1004 and 838.806 are essentially <span id="Page_4369"></span>identical. The two sections were promulgated at the same time in 1992. 57 Fed. Reg. 33,570, 33,571 (1992). Therefore, the reasoning set forth in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> for not applying OPM's regulations in that case is not persuasive here. More important, the Board's decisions in<span class="Italic"> Griffin</span> were issued before the court issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Vaccaro.</span> The AJ did not address <span class="Italic">Vaccaro</span> in her initial decision, and the appellant has not provided a persuasive explanation as to why this case is meaningfully distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Vaccaro.</span> This case, therefore, is controlled by <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> not <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the March 7, 2001 domestic relations order, which first awarded the appellant a survivor annuity, is ineffective because it is a modification to the December 2000 divorce decree that was made after Mr. Short retired and that involved an annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4); <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1284-87. The AJ's initial decision is REVERSED, and OPM's reconsideration decision is SUSTAINED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction is not always crisp between a permissible and impermissible alteration of a divorce order. If a later court order provides a former spouse survivor annuity, but the first divorce decree made specific reference to the survivor annuity, the first decree is sufficient to create the annuity interest and the second court order does not improperly alter the earlier order, <span class="Italic">Ingle v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1995, the appellant and Richard Ingle, who was a Federal employee at the time, were divorced. The divorce was effected via a May 31, 1995 Consent Order and a June 16, 1995 Amended Consent Order. The language at issue in this appeal, found in both the Consent Order and the Amended Consent Order, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">7.&#x2003;The wife, Sharon Ingle, shall share in the husband, Richard Ingle's Civil Service Retirement pursuant to the <span class="Italic">DeLoach</span> Formula and husband, Richard Ingle, shall share in wife's retirement from the school system pursuant to the <span class="Italic">DeLoach</span> Formula.[1]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">"DeLoach</span> Formula" provides that a spouse's interest in retirement benefits is calculated by multiplying one-half times the fraction of total years of marriage during service divided by total years of service. <span class="Italic">See DeLoach v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In October 2003, Mr. Ingle retired from Federal service without electing to provide any survivor annuity benefits. In December 2004, the appellant obtained a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) awarding her a right to a former spouse survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM granted the appellant's application for a portion of Mr. Ingle's CSRS retirement annuity but informed the appellant that the QDRO was "unacceptable for Federal survivor annuity benefit processing" because it was issued after Mr. Ingle's retirement and was not the first order dividing marital property. OPM affirmed its initial decision, in a June 15, 2005 reconsideration decision, finding that the language of paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Consent Order did not expressly provide for a survivor annuity and that the QDRO was not acceptable for processing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of proving entitlement to a survivor annuity is on the applicant for benefits. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v.

A former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity is set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h), which Congress enacted as part of the Spouse Equity Act of 1984. <span class="Italic">Audet v.

Office of Personnel Management,</span> 122 F.3d 1043, 1047 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, the "expressly provided for" provision does not require "magic words," but only that the intent to provide the survivor annuity be clear, definite, explicit, plain, direct, and unmistakable, not dubious or ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Walker v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant does not contest the administrative judge's finding that the December 20, 2004 QDRO was not acceptable for processing.[2] Nor does she contend that paragraph 7 of the Consent Order provides for a survivor annuity. Instead, she relies upon the language in paragraph 8 of the Consent Order, which provides, "The husband shall designate the wife, Sharon Ingle, irrevocably as entitled to the former wife's annuity as provided for in his retirement plan."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not acceptable for processing "if it is issued after the date of retirement or death of the employee and modifies or replaces the first order dividing the marital property of the employee or retiree and the former spouse." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a). A decree dividing marital property without "expressly providing for, or reserving disposition of, a survivor annuity cannot be altered after the employee's death [or retirement] by a court order that purports to award such an annuity." <span class="Italic">Vaccaro v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 262 F.3d 1280, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">see Short v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">She argues that paragraph 8 of the Consent Order provides for additional benefits beyond paragraph 7 and that the language in paragraph 8 is adequate to grant her survivor annuity benefits because it complies with the requirements of OPM's "Guidelines For Interpreting State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses." 5 C.F.R. part 838, subpart J, Appendix B. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM Guidelines provide, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Orders must contain language such as "survivor annuity," "death benefits," <span class="Italic">"former spouse annuity</span> under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(1)," etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;Orders that provide that the former spouse is to "continue as" or <span class="Italic">"be named as" the "designated beneficiary"</span> of CSRS benefits will be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. part 838, subpart J, Appendix B, Part III ("Specificity Required to Award a Former Spouse Annuity"), Section B (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Consent Order specified that "[Mr. Ingle] shall designate the wife, Sharon Ingle, as irrevocably entitled to the former wife's annuity." It thus required Mr. Ingle to "name [&#8197;] " the appellant as the "designated beneficiary" of a "former spouse annuity." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 838, subpart J, Appendix B, Part III, Section B.1 and B.2. We can discern no material difference between the quoted language in paragraph 8 of the Consent Order and the language recommended in the OPM Guidelines, and therefore find that the Consent Order is sufficient to grant the appellant eligibility for a former spouse annuity. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.603 (defining "former spouse annuity" as "a recurring benefit under CSRS that is payable to a former spouse after the retiree's death"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.803(b) (a court order is not acceptable for processing in terms of awarding a former spouse survivor annuity unless it includes terms such as "former spouse annuity").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In affirming OPM's decision to deny the appellant eligibility for survivor annuity benefits, the administrative judge relied upon <span class="Italic">Hokanson,</span> 122 F.3d 1043, and <span class="Italic">Holzman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 254 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 48 F.3d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). ID at 3. These cases held that language in court orders awarding a former spouse a portion of the employee's "civil service retirement benefits" or "pension benefits" is insufficient to award eligibility for a former spouse survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See also Audet,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (language awarding a portion of a "retirement or pension benefit" or a "retirement plan" does not "expressly provide for" a survivor annuity). These cases are distinguishable, however, because the court orders there did not include additional language, as here, specifying that the employee "shall designate" the appellant as the beneficiary of a "former wife's annuity." In fact, in finding the court order inadequate in <span class="Italic">Hokanson,</span> the court pointed out that the court order did "not provide [the former spouse] with a 'former spouse annuity' or designate her as the 'beneficiary' of any such benefits." <span class="Italic">Hokanson,</span> 122 F.3d at 1046. We therefore find that the term "retirement plan" in paragraph 8 of the Consent Order merely refers back to the language in paragraph 7 identifying Mr. Ingle's retirement plan as the "Civil Service Retirement" system, and does not preclude interpreting paragraph 8 to provide for a former spouse survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the Consent Order renders the appellant eligible for a former spouse survivor annuity. Because the Consent Order "contains no provision stating the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity," the appellant is eligible for the maximum allowable survivor annuity. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.921(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walley v. OPM</span>, 114 MSPR 198, 202, 2010 MSPB 115 (2010), decided that a divorce decree did not specifically divide the parties' annuity interests, a task that was accomplished by a later order, when the divorce decree stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IT IS FINALLY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Plaintiff and Defendant be and they are hereby recognized as owners of an undivided one-half (1/2) community interest each in and to all property, real, personal and mixed, which was acquired during the existence of the marriage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The provision was not sufficiently specific to bar a later court order from operating to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse, <span class="Italic">Walley,</span> 114 MSPR at 202-203 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that this language divided the marital property. The administrative judge reasoned that the partition petition acknowledged that some marital property had been previously <span id="Page_4370"></span>divided, and the only conceivable source of authority to divide the marital property between the time of the divorce decree and the partition petition came from the divorce decree. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's reasoning is not persuasive. At the outset, the language of the clause does not support the administrative judge's conclusion. To "partition" is typically defined as the "dividing of land held by joint tenants or tenants in common" or "any division of real or personal property between co-owners resulting in individual ownership." Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition (1990). Similarly, to "divide" is to "cut into parts, separate, or disunite." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the divorce decree specifically acknowledged that the parties owned an "<span class="Italic">undivided</span> one-half (1/2) community interest" in their marital property. This phrase simply cannot be read to divide or partition the marital property into the individual ownership of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also reasoned that the partition petition specifically stated that the parties had partitioned various marital property after the divorce and those partitions had to be pursuant to the divorce decree. The divorce decree, however, did not expressly divide any marital property, so any subsequent partition of marital property could not be pursuant to the terms of the divorce decree. Further, the administrative judge did not consider another potential method for dividing marital property--by agreement. Indeed, the partition petition expressly states the other marital property had been partitioned by "mutual agreement," not court order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the parties' divorce decree simply terminated their marriage and did not distribute any of the marital property, this case is essentially one involving a bifurcated divorce proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287; <span class="Italic">Newman,</span> 962 F.2d at 1010. In such cases, because the subsequent order is the first court order dividing marital property, it is not a modification of the original divorce decree (which did not address the division of marital property) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) is not implicated. <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287; <span class="Italic">Newman,</span> 962 F.2d at 1011.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Avoiding the problem of divorce decrees that are amended to create former spouse survivor annuities, <span class="Italic">Gordon v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 503, 506-09 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-17 (2005), referencing a Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Simpson v. OPM,</span> 347 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2003), essentially construed as an election of a former spouse survivor annuity the employee's election of a then-current spouse survivor annuity elected at the time of retirement, continuing past divorce, when the annuitant continued to receive a diminished annuity and when OPM's election notices regarding continuation of the survivor annuity following divorce were unclear:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, the parties, and the administrative judge have all focused on whether the December 19, 2002 QDRO or the May 7, 2003 nunc pro tunc order impermissibly altered the terms of the October 15, 2002 divorce decree. In <span class="Italic">Simpson,</span> the court found that Mrs. Simpson was entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity under facts which are not materially distinguishable from the ones here. Thus, we find that <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> is controlling. Indeed, the facts in this appeal are more compelling than those in <span class="Italic">Simpson.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Simpson, like Mr. Gordon, retired from federal service after a long marriage. "Upon his retirement, Mr. Simpson elected reduced annuity benefits for himself and for Mrs. Simpson." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This is what Mr. Gordon did. Mr. and Mrs. Simpson divorced in February 1993, about five years after Mr. Simpson retired from the government. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similar facts are presented in this case. Despite the divorce, "Mr. Simpson continued to receive reduced benefits until his death in June 1994." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362. The same is true in this case--Mr. Gordon elected a reduced annuity when he retired and continued to receive reduced annuity payments to provide survivor benefits for the appellant until he died in February 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> granted Mrs. Simpson a former spouse survivor benefit not because of anything that may or may not have been contained in the divorce decree or any subsequent QDRO, but on the basis that OPM's notices to Mr. Simpson regarding the election of former spouse survivor benefits were "legally deficient." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1365. The court found that "none of [the OPM notices] contains any statement that a pre-divorce election automatically terminates upon divorce and that an annuitant must make a new election to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The following is a more detailed statement by the court regarding the OPM notices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM's notices of record fail to comply with the statutory requirement of notice because an annuitant who elects an annuity for his (or her) spouse while married reasonably expects that he has complied with the statute sufficiently to cause the annuity to be paid on his death. At the time of his divorce, Mr. Simpson had already made an election. The problem was that he did not make that election after the divorce, and OPM's notice did not state that he had to do so again even if he had previously made such an election. Mr. Simpson had no reason to know that his election must be renewed following a divorce if he still intended that his former spouse receive the annuity. It is the statutory purpose of a notice to adequately inform an annuitant of the requirements that must be met for a spousal annuity to be provided. Thus, an annual notice is deficient when it fails to inform an annuitant that, even if he had previously elected a spousal annuity when married, he must make a new election after his divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1364-65 (emphasis omitted). The court found for Mrs. Simpson because OPM's notices do not inform an employee who makes an election for surviving spouse benefits when he retired that he must "make a reelection after a divorce in order to provide such an annuity for a former spouse." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1365 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gordon elected a survivor annuity for the appellant when he retired. He took a reduced annuity based on that election. After his divorce from the appellant, he never asked that his annuity be increased so as to not to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant. No evidence shows that Mr. Gordon elected a survivor benefit for his new wife. Further, and over and above the facts in <span class="Italic">Simpson,</span> Mr. Gordon signed a post-divorce court document on December 9, 2002, after he had remarried, expressly providing a former spouse survivor annuity to the appellant under the applicable CSRS statutory provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM submitted what it alleges is a copy of a notice sent to Mr. Gordon after his divorce in October 2002 and before his death in February 2003. Section 3 of that notice states, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Survivor Annuity for a Former Spouse</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Eligibility and Time Limits</span>--With some exceptions, retirees are eligible to elect a reduced annuity to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse if they send a signed request to OPM 1) within 2 years after the marriage ended by divorce or annulment or 2) within 2 years after the date another former spouse loses entitlement to a survivor annuity benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Simpson,</span> the notice here did not inform Mr. Gordon, who continued to receive a reduced annuity after his divorce from the appellant to provide her with a survivor benefit, that he needed to reelect a survivor benefit for her. Thus, the OPM notice sent to Mr. Gordon suffers from the same legal deficiency as did the notice in <span class="Italic">Simpson.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> court pointed out that the Federal Circuit has held in several other cases that "'an employee's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity following divorce, standing alone, adequately demonstrated that employee's intent to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1366-67, <span class="Italic">quoting Wood v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 241 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). As discussed above, not only did Mr. Gordon continue to accept a reduced annuity to provide a survivor benefit for the appellant after their divorce, he affirmatively stated in a post-divorce signed document filed with the appropriate court on December 19, 2002, that he wished the appellant to receive a former spouse survivor benefit under the CSRA and OPM's regulations at "Part 838, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations." In addition, Mr. Gordon did not elect a survivor benefit for his new spouse, whom he married before signing the December 19, 2002 court document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> applies. In <span class="Italic">Simpson,</span> the court "instructed [the Board] to order OPM to grant Mrs. Simpson the former spouse survivor annuity as if Mr. Simpson had made a timely reelection." 347 F.3d at 1367. We must do the same for Mrs. Gordon. Thus, OPM's reconsideration decision and the initial decision are reversed, and we grant a former spouse survivor benefit to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a divorce decree divides an annuity but does not provide for a former spouse annuity and OPM rejected a later court decree that establishes the right to a former spouse annuity, the Board constructively elected for the annuitant (or former spouse) the former spouse annuity the Board determined that the annuitant, who was taking a reduced lifetime annuity in favor of the former spouse, would have selected had he been properly informed of his options by notices from or communications with OPM, <span class="Italic">Djeridi v. OPM</span>, 115 MSPR 250, 252-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-6, 9-18, 2010 MSPB 230 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and Edmund Djeridi had been married for more than 39 years when Mr. Djeridi retired from federal service under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) on January 3, 1996. At the time of his retirement, he chose to receive a reduced annuity in order to provide a maximum survivor annuity for the appellant. On July 19, 1999, Mr. Djeridi and the appellant divorced. The July 19, 1999 divorce decree divided marital property and provided that the appellant would receive 50% of Mr. Djeridi's retirement annuity, but did not mention a survivor annuity. On August 21, 2000, OPM wrote letters to Mr. Djeridi and the appellant explaining that it would pay the appellant 50% of Mr. Djeridi's gross annuity benefit each month as directed in the divorce decree. OPM's letters further stated that the divorce decree did not award survivor benefits. The letters did not explain that their divorce automatically nullified Mr. Djeridi's prior election to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant; however, OPM generally informed Mr. Djeridi that, although a subsequent court order that modified or replaced the first court order dividing marital property would not be acceptable for processing under <span id="Page_4371"></span>its regulations, he "may" voluntarily elect survivor benefits for his former spouse within 2 years of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a letter dated November 7, 2000, the appellant asked OPM to consider her entitlement to a survivor annuity based on a Qualified Court Order issued by a Florida state court on June 1, 2000, which purported to award the appellant the maximum former spouse survivor annuity. On April 7, 2001, OPM wrote letters to Mr. Djeridi and the appellant that were similar to the letters of August 21, 2000, except that OPM characterized the letters as an initial decision and stated how to request reconsideration with OPM. The letters made no reference to the June 1, 2000 Qualified Court Order, but apparently relying on the divorce decree, stated that OPM would pay 50% of Mr. Djeridi's gross annuity to the appellant each month, and further that "[w]e find no references to former spouse survivor benefits in your court order." These letters did not explain that the appellant was no longer entitled to a survivor annuity based on Mr. Djeridi's pre-divorce election, or that Mr. Djeridi could or should submit a new voluntary election to provide such a benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Meanwhile, in the fall of 2000, Mr. Djeridi wrote OPM on at least two occasions to request information about the survivor annuity election referenced in OPM's August 21, 2000 letter. On or about December 22, 2000, OPM sent Mr. Djeridi a Former Spouse Survivor Annuity Election form (RI 2064) (revised February 1999). That form stated the time limit for electing to provide a survivor benefit for a former spouse, but again failed to explain that Mr. Djeridi was required to submit a new election form because his pre-divorce election was no longer valid.<span class="Italic"></span> The information provided by OPM indicated that there would be no adjustment to Mr. Djeridi's gross monthly annuity if he elected a maximum survivor benefit for his former spouse, and that the maximum survivor benefit would be $1,056 per month plus future cost-of-living adjustments. On or about February 24, 2001, Mr. Djeridi completed the portion of the election form requesting additional information from OPM on electing a smaller survivor benefit, and he returned the form to OPM. Specifically, Mr. Djeridi requested information about the impact on his gross annuity if he elected to provide a former spouse survivor annuity of only $1,000 per month. He did not complete the portions of the form that would have indicated that he either wished to elect, or had decided not to provide, a survivor benefit. Having not received a reply to his request, Mr. Djeridi wrote a June 13, 2001 letter to OPM seeking a response to his inquiry as soon as possible because he understood his filing time limit would expire in July 2001. A few days later, however, he wrote OPM again instructing OPM to "disregard" his June 13, 2001 letter because, "I've changed my mind. I don't want the application." On June 21, 2001, OPM returned Mr. Djeridi's election form to him, instructing him to complete the reverse of the form as soon as possible if he wished to make a survivor election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not contain any indication that Mr. Djeridi contacted OPM again regarding a survivor annuity. However, the appellant wrote to OPM in 2005 "to confirm" that she would receive a survivor annuity upon her ex-husband's death. OPM sent her a written response stating that she would receive a survivor annuity at a rate of $1,152 per month, plus any future cost-of-living adjustments. It is undisputed that the reduction in Mr. Djeridi's gross annuity to pay for the costs of a maximum survivor annuity continued until his death on February 21, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following Mr. Djeridi's death, the appellant applied for a former spouse survivor annuity from OPM. OPM denied the appellant's application, the appellant requested reconsideration, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> Subtab 2B, and OPM issued a reconsideration decision affirming its initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, as the applicant for benefits, bears the burden of proving entitlement to a former spouse survivor annuity by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">McKenzie v.

Thus, the appellant's entitlement to a survivor annuity, based on Mr. Djeridi's pre-divorce election to provide such benefits, terminated when Mr. Djeridi and the appellant divorced in 1999.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The former spouse of a retired federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity if the employee expressly provided for one in an election under 5 U.S.C. 8339(j)(3), or in the terms of any divorce decree, or in any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement issued in connection with the divorce decree. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1); <span class="Italic">Bleidorn v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 456, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). OPM's implementing regulations explain that, for the purpose of awarding a former spouse survivor annuity, or explaining, interpreting, or clarifying a court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity, a court order must be issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death of the employee, or be the first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a)-(b); <span class="Italic">Bleidorn,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 456, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and we agree, that the appellant's July 1999 divorce decree divided marital property, including pension benefits, but did not expressly mention a survivor annuity. We also agree with the administrative judge's implicit finding that the June 1, 2000 Qualified Court Order entered subsequent to Mr. Djeridi's retirement was a modification of the first order and thus, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) and OPM's implementing regulations, was ineffective for the purpose of awarding a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Short v.

Further, the appellant has not presented any basis to disturb the administrative judge's explained finding that, under the circumstances of this case, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the Qualified Court Order could be considered a timely election of former spousal annuity benefits for the appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We REOPEN this case on our own motion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118 to address OPM's apparent concession, made for the first time on review, that it sent Mr. Djeridi "a legally deficient notice" of his right to elect a former spouse survivor annuity for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has a statutory obligation to notify each annuitant annually of his election rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note; <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1334; <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, 1559-60 (Fed. Cir. 1992). "A former spouse may receive survivor annuity benefits, even without an affirmative election by the annuitant, if (1) the annuitant did not receive the required notice, and (2) 'there [is] evidence sufficient to show that the retiree indeed intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse.'" <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1334-35 <span class="Italic">(quoting Wood v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 241 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, OPM had the burden of proving both that it sent the annual notice and that the notice was adequate to inform Mr. Djeridi of the specific election requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j). <span class="Italic">See Painter v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 5 (2007). We find that OPM has not met its burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's annual notices failed to inform Mr. Djeridi that his pre-divorce election of a maximum survivor annuity had been nullified by the intervening divorce, and that he was required to make a new election within 2 years of their divorce if he still intended that his former spouse receive an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 347 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("[a]nnual notice is deficient when it fails to inform an annuitant that, even if he had previously elected a spousal annuity when married, he must make a new election after his divorce."). Similarly, OPM's notices also failed to inform Mr. Djeridi that his continued receipt of a reduced annuity did not constitute an election to provide for a survivor annuity for his former spouse. <span class="Italic">See Simpson,</span> 347 F.3d at 1366; <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 241 F.3d at 1367 (holding that a letter OPM sent to the annuitant was inadequate notice because it failed to mention a requirement that he make an election after his divorce, and it failed to inform him that his "continued receipt of a reduced annuity would not suffice to constitute an election"). As the court explained in <span class="Italic">Simpson,</span> we find that "OPM's notices of record fail to comply with the statutory requirement of notice because an annuitant who elects an annuity for his (or her) spouse while married reasonably expects that he has complied with the statute sufficiently to cause the annuity to be paid on his death." <span class="Italic">See</span> 347 F.3d at 1364.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, beyond the annual notices, there was substantial communication between OPM and Mr. Djeridi prior to the expiration of the 2-year election period. We have reviewed these communications, but find no indication that OPM ever expressly informed Mr. Djeridi that a pre-divorce election automatically terminates upon divorce and that an annuitant must make a new election to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse. Thus, none of this additional communication cured the fundamental defects in OPM's annual notices. <span class="Italic">See Simpson,</span> 347 F.3d at 1364-65; <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 241 F.3d at 1367.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has shown by preponderant evidence that Mr. Djeridi intended that she receive a maximum survivor annuity, as he had elected prior to their divorce. It is undisputed that Mr. Djeridi continued to receive a reduced annuity as if his pre-divorce survivor benefit election remained effective throughout his lifetime. Continued acceptance of a reduced annuity can be a strong indication that the annuitant intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse. <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 241 F.3d at 1368 ("In both <span class="Italic">Brush and Vallee [v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 58 F.3d 613 (Fed. Cir. 1995)], this court found that an employee's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity following divorce, standing alone, adequately demonstrated that employee's intent to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse."); <span class="Italic">accord Simpson,</span> 347 F.3d at 1366-67. OPM argues that because "Mr. Djeridi wrote to OPM to state that he did not wish to elect a former spouse survivor annuity for the appellant...his actions were fundamentally inconsistent with the intent to continue to provide survivor benefits, and the continuation of the survivor reduction <span id="Page_4372"></span>do[es] not 'stand alone' to show intent. We find that the record does not support OPM's contention. OPM is apparently referring to Mr. Djeridi's letter to OPM in mid-June 2001, instructing OPM to "disregard" his June 13, 2001 letter because, "I've changed my mind. I don't want the application. We find, however, that Mr. Djeridi's prior communication with OPM indicates that Mr. Djeridi was considering the possibility of slightly reducing the amount of the appellant's maximum survivor benefit, rather than eliminating it entirely. In that context, his mid-June 2001 letter indicating that he had "changed [his] mind," referred to his prior inquiry for more information on that option. Thus, we find that this final correspondence from Mr. Djeridi to OPM supports a finding that Mr. Djeridi intended that OPM make no adjustment to the maximum survivor annuity election he had made at the time of his retirement. Mr. Djeridi never sought to cancel the reduction to his annuity, and he did not take affirmative steps to discontinue the survivor annuity benefits for the appellant after the divorce. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1334-35 (former spouse seeking a survivor annuity failed to demonstrate that her ex-husband intended that she receive such benefits based on his continued receipt of a reduced annuity, because her ex-husband had informed OPM during the election period that he wanted to terminate survivor benefits for the appellant). Under the circumstances, we find that Mr. Djeridi adequately manifested his intention that the appellant receive a maximum survivor annuity consistent with his pre-divorce election. <span class="Italic">See Simpson,</span> 347 F.3d at 1366-67; <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 241 F.3d at 1368.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interpreting the statutes governing successive court orders affecting the division of annuity interests, <span class="Italic">Bleidorn v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 456, 460-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-12, 2009 MSPB 111 (2009), determined that a subsequent court order could not bestow a former spouse annuity because an earlier court order divided the employee's lifetime annuity, but the second court order qualified as an election that could be made within two years from retirement to create and confer the survivor annuity interest:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of proving entitlement to a survivor annuity, by a preponderance of the evidence, is on the applicant for benefits. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] . In pertinent part, the former spouse of a retired federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity if the employee expressly provided for one in an election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3), or in the terms of any divorce decree, or in any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement issued in connection with the divorce decree. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 407 F.3d 1309, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The statute further dictates that a modification of such a divorce decree or court order is not effective if it is made after the retirement or death of the employee, to the extent that the modification involves a former spouse survivor annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4); <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> 407 F.3d at 1313, 1315. OPM's implementing regulations explain that, for the purpose of awarding a former spouse survivor annuity, or explaining, interpreting, or clarifying a court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity, a court order must be issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death of the employee, or be the first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a)-(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse is the March 31, 2005 divorce decree, which divided marital property, including Mr. Bleidorn's retirement annuity, but was silent on the question of a former spouse survivor annuity. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(1)(i). Because the March 31, 2005 divorce decree divided property, but was silent on the question of a survivor annuity, any subsequent court order would be a prohibited modification of that first order and ineffective under the statute and the regulations, to the extent it addressed a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Rafferty v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 407 F.3d 1317, 1323-24 (Fed. Cir. 2005) <span class="Italic">(citing Vaccaro v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 262 F.3d 1280, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that the provision in the divorce decree calling for a QDRO to evidence "[t]he division of [Mr. Bleidorn's] Civil Service Retirement" either awarded her a former spouse survivor annuity or is sufficient to allow for a subsequently issued QDRO to award her a former spouse survivor annuity is without merit. First, the language in the divorce decree awarding the appellant a portion of Mr. Bleidorn's "Civil Service Retirement," is insufficient, in and of itself, to award her a former spouse survivor annuity because, "an award directing the payment of a share of a federal employee's retirement benefits is distinct from, and will not be interpreted as, an award of a survivor annuity," <span class="Italic">see Hokanson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 122 F.3d 1043, 1046 (Fed. Cir. 1997). This is because "an award of a former spouse survivor annuity must be express," and the language that the appellant cites does not expressly award her a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1047. Given the lack of an express reference to survivor benefits, the language that the appellant cites is also insufficient to reserve the question of a former spouse survivor annuity for the purpose of addressing it in a subsequently issued court order. <span class="Italic">See Rafferty,</span> 407 F.3d at 1323-24; <span class="Italic">Vaccaro,</span> 262 F.3d at 1287. Thus, we find that the first order dividing the marital property failed to expressly provide for a former spouse survivor annuity, and the subsequent QDRO and amended QDRO were not court orders acceptable for processing with regard to a survivor annuity because they modified the first order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as an alternative to using a court order issued in connection with the divorce, a retiree may directly elect to provide a former spouse survivor annuity within 2 years after the date of the divorce, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1); <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> 407 F.3d at 1316. In the supplement to her petition for review, the appellant contends, for the first time, that the amended QDRO was a timely filed written election of a former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3). We would normally decline to consider an argument raised for the first time on petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Banks v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980). However, neither OPM nor the administrative judge appear to have considered the matter in this regard or to have specifically notified the appellant regarding the potential applicability of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3). Further, the appellant, who proceeded <span class="Italic">pro se</span> until this point, raised the issue in her first submission after securing legal representation, PFRF, Tab 1, and the Board has placed a high priority on resolving retirement benefit cases on the merits, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Murphy v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 431, &#x00B6; 19 (2006) (the paramount concern in a retirement appeal is whether the appellant is entitled to the benefit she seeks, not how well she argues her case) <span class="Italic">(citing Karker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 9 (1998)). Thus, we have considered the appellant's argument that the amended QDRO was a timely filed election of a former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3), and we find it meritorious for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her argument, the appellant cites our reviewing court's discussion in <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> 407 F.3d at 1317, regarding the treatment of a QDRO, which OPM deemed not acceptable for processing as a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity, as an election to provide a former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j). In <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> the court remanded the appeal to the Board because OPM failed to give the retiree the required notice of his right, following his divorce, to elect a survivor annuity for his former spouse, and the record was insufficient to determine the retiree's intent with respect to the survivor annuity issue. 407 F.3d at 1316-17. The court declined to address the question of whether the QDRO was a timely election of a former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j) because the appellant failed to raise the argument in her brief, only raising it at oral argument, and, as mentioned above, the issue presented factual issues that could not be resolved on the existing record. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1317.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the instant record is sufficient to resolve the issue in this case. Unlike the retiree in <span class="Italic">Warren,</span> Mr. Bleidorn endorsed the document asserted as a timely election of former spouse survivor annuity benefits, the amended QDRO, specifically indicating that it was "SEEN AND APPROVED" by him. Additionally, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Mr. Bleidorn did not want his former spouse to receive survivor benefits or that he had remarried at the time he endorsed the amended QDRO on November 15, 2005, or since. Further, although Mr. Bleidorn is not an intervenor in this proceeding, his endorsement of both QDROs, and his other subsequent signed statements, establish that his intention and desire was for the appellant to receive a former spouse survivor annuity based on his federal service. The amended QDRO meets the regulatory requirements under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.632(a) that an election of a former spouse survivor annuity be made in writing and be filed with OPM within 2 years after the retiree's marriage to the former spouse terminates. Because we grant the appellant's petition for review on this basis, we need not address the appellant's remaining argument that OPM failed to provide the statutorily required notice of his right to elect a former spouse survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we grant the appellant's petition for review on our determination that the submission of the amended QDRO satisfies the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.632(a) to elect a former spouse survivor annuity for the appellant. Giving effect to this election will likely result in a reapportionment of Mr. Bleidorn's annuity. We find that the Board currently lacks jurisdiction over issues related to the apportionment of Mr. Bleidorn's annuity given his election of maximum survivor benefits for the appellant, because OPM has not issued a final or reconsideration decision on the matter. <span class="Italic">See Garside v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 65, &#x00B6; 3, n.* (2008) ("Generally, the Board has no jurisdiction over a retirement matter until after OPM has issued a final or reconsideration decision adjudicating that matter.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bleidorn,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. OPM</span>, 113 MSPR 240, 246-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16, 18-19, 2010 MSPB 27 (2010) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. OPM,</span> 115 MSPR 358, 2010 MSPB 246 (2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>), when a subsequent court order established the right to a former spouse annuity, but the employee changed his mind after that court order and decided that he no longer wanted to provide the former spouse annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4373"></span>In an initial decision, issued on November 6, 2008, OPM denied Ms. McKenzie's application for survivor annuity benefits on the basis that the court's October 25, 2007 order was not acceptable for processing. Ms. McKenzie requested reconsideration, and OPM denied Ms. McKenzie's request, finding that the court's July 6, 2006 order was not acceptable for processing. In the reconsideration decision, which is dated February 10, 2009, OPM found that Mr. McKenzie did not make a voluntary election of former spouse survivor benefits within 2 years after the date of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ determined that, under all of the circumstances in the case, the state court's October 25, 2007 order should have been deemed a voluntary election of survivor benefits by Mr. McKenzie within the 2-year window for making such elections. On review, Mr. McKenzie questions this finding, and argues that early in this protracted process he was receptive to Ms. McKenzie receiving a survivor annuity, but by the time the court issued the October 25, 2007 amended judgment he was no longer interested in that election. Mr. McKenzie asserts that he was aware of the 2-year period for electing a former spouse survivor annuity, and that he would have filed such an election if that had been his wish. Mr. McKenzie also contends that Ms. Albertoni's approval of the October 25, 2007 order did not express his intention to make an election, and although he knew that he was bound by the court's orders awarding a survivor benefit to Ms. McKenzie, his acknowledgment of this obligation in pleadings below did not mean that it was his choice to elect a survivor annuity benefit for her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering all of the arguments and evidence, we reopen this appeal on our own motion, and affirm the AJ's finding in the initial decision as modified by this opinion and order. In particular, we find that Mr. McKenzie, through Ms. Albertoni's actions, communicated to OPM a voluntary election, in writing, to provide a former spouse survivor annuity to Ms. McKenzie. In particular, Ms. Albertoni's correspondence with OPM in March, April and July 2006, her preparation of the court's July 6, 2006 Retirement Benefits Order, and her signature approving the court's October 25, 2007 amended judgment all indicate Mr. McKenzie's clear intent to elect a former spouse survivor annuity. Indeed, Mr. McKenzie has acknowledged on review that he agreed with providing Ms. McKenzie a survivor annuity at the time of their divorce and that Ms. Albertoni's actions were taken with his knowledge and authorization. Furthermore, although Mr. McKenzie contends that he changed his mind by October 2007 and the provision of a survivor annuity was no longer his choice at that time, there is no indication that he ever communicated this change of mind to anyone prior to the filing of this appeal. Thus, the undisputed record shows that Ms. Albertoni represented Mr. McKenzie in the state court proceedings below, and she consistently represented to the court and to OPM that it was his intention to provide Ms. McKenzie with a survivor annuity. It is well established that a person is bound by the consequences of his representative's conduct. <span class="Italic">See Rowe v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 802 F.2d 434, 437 (Fed. Cir. 1986) <span class="Italic">(citing Link v. Wabash Railroad Co.,</span> 370 U.S. 626, 633-34, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 1390-91, 8 L. Ed.2d 734 (1962)). Thus, the record as a whole shows that Mr. McKenzie made a voluntary election for Ms. McKenzie to receive a former spouse survivor annuity within 2 years of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, contrary to OPM's arguments on review, we find no basis for finding that a retired employee must personally sign an election of a former spouse survivor annuity or that he cannot delegate an authorized representative to make an election for him. The provision of the statute at issue, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3), provides that an employee who has a former spouse may elect at the time of retirement or within 2 years after the dissolution of the marriage to elect a survivor annuity for the former spouse. The statute, however, does not set forth any specific form which the election must take, and, unlike other similar provisions in the statute, it does not state that the election must be signed by the employee.[3] OPM's implementing regulation states that a retiree may elect in writing a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity. Such an election must be received within 2 years after the retiree's marriage to the former spouse terminates. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.632. Therefore, under the applicable statute and regulations, an annuitant may make an election of survivor benefits for his former spouse through any other writing provided that such writing manifests the intent to elect such benefits. More specifically, there is nothing in the language of section 8339(j)(3) and the relevant OPM regulations which may be read as requiring that an election must contain a signature by the retiree. Therefore, we affirm the AJ's initial decision awarding Ms. McKenzie a former spouse survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In its PFR, OPM argues that an election must be signed by Mr. McKenzie based upon the Board's decision in<span class="Italic"> Vincent v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 307, 310-11 (1998). In <span class="Italic">Vincent,</span> the Board found that a retired employee, who marries after retirement, may make an election for his current spouse under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A) within 2 years of a post-retirement marriage by submitting a signed election in writing to OPM, but that the statute does not require that the signed election be a holographic signature. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the Board found that absent a specific statutory or regulatory requirement, the retired employee was not required to personally sign the election of survivor benefits for it to be valid, but that his spouse, acting at his direction and request, and in his presence, could sign the election on his behalf. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 311. We find that <span class="Italic">Vincent</span> is inapposite to this appeal because section 8339(j)(3) and its implementing regulation, unlike section 8339(k)(2)(A), does not specifically require that the election of a former spouse survivor annuity be signed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McKenzie v. OPM</span>, 115 MSPR 358, 363, 365 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 19, 2010 MSPB 246 (2010), denied OPM's reconsideration request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have recognized that a court order that is defective under &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) may nevertheless qualify as an election under &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3). <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 407 F.3d 1309, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Bleidorn v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 456, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9-11 (2009). Here, the July 6, 2006 retirement benefits order explicitly awards a former spouse survivor annuity to Ms. McKenzie, stating, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Mr. McKenzie "agrees to take all necessary steps to elect" a former spouse survivor benefit for Ms. McKenzie. <span class="Italic">McKenzie,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 240 &#x00B6; 11. The Board held that the order, buttressed by other correspondence sent to OPM by Mr. McKenzie's attorney, as well as the October 25, 2007 amended judgment, "all indicate Mr. McKenzie's clear intent to elect a former spouse survivor annuity." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, we note that the parties repeatedly attempted to contact OPM for guidance on how to provide survivor benefits for Ms. McKenzie. "It seems safe to assume that an agency that administers a government program, particularly those as complex as the programs administered by OPM, brings to it a level of expertise not necessarily shared by the general public." <span class="Italic">Byrum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 618 F.3d 1323, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Clearly, the parties would have benefited from OPM's expertise, but OPM repeatedly and routinely ignored their inquiries. This is unfortunate, because had OPM assisted the parties, this prolonged litigation may not have been necessary.</p>
