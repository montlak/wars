<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-77"><span class="space">B.</span> INTERIM RELIEF</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Section 6 of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 USC 7701(b)(2)(A), amended the Civil Service Reform Act and authorized the Board to provide appellants who prevail at the regional office level with interim relief between the date of the initial decision and the date that the Board issues a final decision on a PFR. If no PFR is filed, the initial decision becomes an enforceable final decision and the employee is entitled to final rather than interim relief. The statutory change was a major advance in civil service law. The earlier rule of the MSPB was that the remedy directed by an AJ's decision was stayed pending resolution of an appeal by the agency--a process that could and often did take years--cold comfort to the ex-employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The interim relief legislation, codified at 5 USC 7701(b), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003;If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party in an appeal under this subsection, the employee or applicant shall be granted the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e), unless--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_1662"></span>(i)&#x2003;the deciding official determines that the granting of such relief is not appropriate; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)(I)the relief granted in the decision provides that such employee or applicant shall return or be present at the place of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(II)&#x2003;the employing agency, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), determines that the return or presence of such employee or applicant is unduly disruptive to the work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)&#x2003;If an agency makes a determination under subparagraph (A)(ii)(II) that prevents the return or presence of an employee at the place of employment, such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;Nothing in the provisions of this paragraph may be construed to require any award of back pay or attorney fees be paid before the decision is final.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute in essence requires that an initial decision favoring the employee be implemented pending an appeal by the agency unless the AJ decides that the interim relief is inappropriate. If the AJ restores the employee to the job, the agency may block the restoration if it places the employee in the pay status directed by the AJ and if the agency determines that restoration of the employee is unduly disruptive to the workplace. The interim relief provisions restore a practice employed by the Civil Service Commission of requiring interim appointments of appellants who prevailed at the initial level of the administrative appellate practice. The Commission's practice was discontinued by the MSPB when the Board commenced operations in 1978 or 1979. The 1989 WPA reinstated interim relief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There have been several iterations of the regulations issued by MSPB implementing the interim relief statutory amendment. The current regulatory requirements are, 5 CFR 1201.41, 5 CFR 1201.111 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.41 <span class="Italic">Judges</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority</span>. Judges will conduct fair and impartial hearings and will issue timely and clear decisions based on statutes and legal precedents. They will have all powers necessary to that end unless those powers are otherwise limited by law. Judges' powers include, but are not limited to, the authority to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(16) Determine, in decisions in which the appellant is the prevailing party, whether the granting of interim relief is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.111 <span class="Italic">Initial decision by judge</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Each initial decision will contain:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;A statement, if the appellant is the prevailing party, as to whether interim relief is provided effective upon the date of the decision, pending the outcome of any petition for review filed by another party under subpart C of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interim Relief</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2), if the appellant is the prevailing party, the initial decision will provide appropriate interim relief to the appellant effective upon the date of the initial decision and remaining in effect until the date of the final order of the Board on any petition for review, unless the judge determines that the granting of interim relief is not appropriate. The agency may decline to return the appellant to his or her place of employment if it determines that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly disruptive to the work environment. However, pay and benefits must be provided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An initial decision that orders interim relief shall include a section which will provide the appellant specific notice that the relief ordered in the decision must be provided by the agency effective as of the date of the decision if a party files a petition for review. If the relief ordered in the initial decision requires the agency to effect an <span id="Page_1663"></span>appointment, the notice required by this section will so state, will specify the title and grade of the appointment, and will specifically advise the appellant of his right to receive pay and benefits while any petition for review is pending, even if the agency determines that the appellant's return to or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant has a limited time to challenge an agency PFR based on deficiencies in interim relief. 5 CFR 1201.116 (2022) provides as to a challenge to interim relief, or enforcement of interim relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Compliance with orders for interim relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Certification of compliance</span>. If the appellant was the prevailing party in the initial decision and the decision granted the appellant interim relief, any petition or cross petition for review filed by the agency must be accompanied by a certification that the agency has complied with the interim relief order either by providing the required interim relief or by satisfying the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Challenge to certification</span>. If the appellant challenges the agency's certification of compliance with the interim relief order, the Board will issue an order affording the agency the opportunity to submit evidence of its compliance. The appellant may respond to the agency's submission of evidence within 10 days after the date of service of the submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Allegation of noncompliance in petition or cross petition for review</span>. If an appellant or an intervenor files a petition or cross petition for review of an initial decision ordering interim relief and such petition includes a challenge to the agency's compliance with the interim relief order, upon order of the Board the agency must submit evidence that it has provided the interim relief required or that it has satisfied the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Request for dismissal for noncompliance with interim relief order</span>. If the agency files a petition or cross petition for review and has not provided the required interim relief, the appellant may request dismissal of the agency's petition. Any such request must be filed with the Clerk of the Board within 25 days of the date of service of the agency's petition. A copy of the response must be served on the agency at the same time it is filed with the Board. The agency may respond with evidence and argument to the appellant's request to dismiss within 15 days of the date of service of the request. If the appellant files a motion to dismiss beyond the time limit, the Board will dismiss the motion as untimely unless the appellant shows that it is based on information not readily available before the close of the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Effect of failure to show compliance with interim relief order</span>. Failure by an agency to provide the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section with its petition or cross petition for review, or to provide evidence of compliance in response to a Board order in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section, may result in the dismissal of the agency's petition or cross petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Back pay and attorney fees</span>. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any payment of back pay for the period preceding the date of the judge's initial decision or attorney fees before the decision of the Board becomes final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Allegations of noncompliance after a final decision is issued</span>. If the initial decision granted the appellant interim relief, but the appellant is not the prevailing party in the final Board order disposing of a petition for review, and the appellant believes that the agency has not provided full interim relief, the appellant may file an enforcement petition with the regional office under 1201.182 of this part. The appellant must file this petition within 20 days of learning of the agency's failure to provide full interim relief. If the appellant prevails in the final Board order disposing of a petition for review, then any interim relief enforcement motion filed will be treated as a motion for enforcement of the final decision. Petitions under this subsection will be processed under 1201.183 of this part.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The nature of interim relief was described in <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 536, 548-49 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An interim relief order does not stay an adverse action; the action is still effective until the Board's decision reversing it becomes final. Rather, the interim relief order requires the agency to place the appellant under an interim appointment during the period that a petition for review is pending and until the Board issues its final decision in the appeal. As noted above, a Board decision becomes final on the date an Opinion and Order reversing the action is issued, or, in instances in which an administrative judge's initial decision becomes the final decision of the Board, 35 days after the date of issuance of the initial decision. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.113. In addition, interim relief requires only that the appellant be returned to his former position, or that he receive the same pay, compensation, and benefits that he would have received had he been returned to duty. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)-(B). An interim relief order does not require cancellation of the adverse action as if it had never existed. In fact, if an agency attempts to comply with an interim relief order by cancelling the adverse action, the Board has held that such cancellation moots the agency's petition for review and requires dismissal of the petition<span class="Italic">.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 53 MSPR 586, 588-89 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The purpose of interim relief is to protect the appellant from hardship during the pendency of her appeal if she prevails in the initial decision, and interim relief benefits both the agency and the appellant and the agency by limiting the waste of human and financial resources during the pendency of a PFR. <span class="Italic">Herrin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 95 MSPR 536, 545 &#x00B6; 15 (2004).

DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 632, 634-35 &#x00B6; 6 (2003) (suitability appeal).

Chiappetta</span>, CB-7521-16-0014-N-1 (NP 12/2/2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"The purpose of...interim relief is not to make the appellant whole but to grant her the pay, compensation, and benefits of the position awarded in the initial decision during the pendency of the petition for review." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Briley v.

<p class="Body-Text">The current regulation, establishing a certification process for agencies to demonstrate compliance with interim regulations, dates back to a 1999 regulatory revision that eased a prior requirement that agencies provide evidence, and follow other steps, to demonstrate, as a condition to the consideration by the Board of an agency PFR, that interim relief was properly provided. Under current practice, "[t]he agency's certification must show, at a minimum, that it has appointed the appellant to a position carrying the proper title, grade, and rate of pay, and that the appointment was effective as of the date of the initial decision." <span class="Italic">Powell v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 358, 359 &#x00B6; 3 (2001). The regulation in effect before the 1999 modification was more complex and, as a result, agencies were more likely to have their PFRs challenged when appellants discovered defects in the implementation of interim relief and notification to the appellant or appellant's counsel of that implementation. The current regulation requires the agency to provide interim relief and to certify "that the agency has complied with the interim relief order either by providing the required interim relief or by satisfying the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)." The current regulation throws on the appellant the burden of demonstrating defects in interim relief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The purpose of the 1999 regulatory revision was to reduce the complexity of providing and certifying interim relief and to avoid some procedural defaults agencies were suffering as a result of failure to properly implement interim relief requirements. The Federal Register notice of May 24, 1999 (64 Fed. Reg. 27900), described the intent of the revision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A), an employee or applicant for employment who prevails in an appeal to the Board must be granted interim relief--that is, the relief provided in the MSPB administrative judge's initial decision--if a petition for review of the initial decision is filed with the Board. Such interim relief must be effected as of the date of the initial decision and must remain in effect until the Board issues a decision on the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two exceptions to the requirement for interim relief. Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(i), interim relief will not be granted if the administrative judge determines that the granting of such relief is not appropriate. Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii), complete interim relief will not be provided if the initial decision provides that the appellant shall return to or be present at the place of employment and the agency determines that the return or presence of the appellant would be unduly disruptive to the work environment. Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(B), an agency that makes an undue disruption determination under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) must provide the appellant with pay and benefits during the period pending the outcome of a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's rule at 5 CFR 1201.115(b), in a case where interim relief has been granted, an agency must submit with its petition for review evidence that it has provided the interim relief required by the initial decision--paragraph (b)(1)--or evidence that it has made an undue disruption determination and is providing the appellant with pay and benefits as required--paragraph (b)(2). The rule further provides that if the agency does not submit evidence showing compliance with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2), the Board will dismiss the agency's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this rule, a dismissal might occur, for example, where an agency shows that it has reinstated an appellant's pay and benefits as of the date of the initial decision but fails to submit with its petition for review evidence that it has made an undue disruption determination to support its failure to restore the appellant to his former position. The circumstances of a case may demonstrate, however, that the agency's actions are equivalent to an undue disruption determination. In other circumstances, evidence of an undue disruption determination may be submitted late. In circumstances such as these, where the appellant's pay and benefits have been restored effective from the date of the initial decision, if there is no harm to the appellant, dismissal of the agency's petition for review should not be required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In keeping with its commitment to resolving disputes on the merits rather than dismissing them on the basis of a technical violation of a rule, not mandated by statute, the Board has determined that its requirements with respect to interim relief should be modified.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McDonald v. VA</span>, 86 MSPR 539, 542 &#x00B6; 7 (2000), explained that the 1999 amendments of the procedures governing interim relief were intended to facilitate agency compliance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When, effective May 24, 1999, the Board amended its interim relief regulations, it specified that where an agency submits its undue disruption determination late, or even where it fails to submit it at all with its petition, if the circumstances of the case show that its actions are equivalent to it, and the appellant's pay and benefits have been restored as of the date of the ID, and there is no harm to him, dismissal of the PFR is not required. <span class="Italic">See</span> 64 Fed. Reg. 27,900 (1999); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Much of the law concerning the complexities of interim relief developed before the 1999 regulatory revision. In earlier regulations, the agency was required to accompany a PFR with evidence that the agency provided interim relief, as well as with evidence of notification to the appellant and to the AJ of any undue disruption determination and evidence showing that the appellant was placed in pay status during the pendency of interim relief. Disputes arose as to the sufficiency of the evidence and notifications provided by agencies attempting to meet interim relief requirements, and more than a few agency PFRs were dismissed for lack of technical requirements with prior regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The current certification process does not eliminate the need for proper interim relief, although it reduces the number of disputes concerning the technicalities of how interim relief is demonstrated, at least conditionally and subject to later challenge, when a PFR is filed by an agency. Cases decided by the Board involving interim relief issues predating the regulatory revisions may, or may not, provide value as precedent, depending on whether the issue considered was the substance of the interim relief provided to the appellant or whether the issue was one of compliance with preexisting requirements concerning evidentiary submissions and the notifications of interim relief or undue disruption determinations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The interim relief provisions were effective July 9, 1989. Before then, actions pending, i.e., at least at the proposal stage, did not fall within the coverage of the interim relief protections. <span class="Italic">Butz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 539, 540 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kent v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 676, 679 (1990) (interim relief was unavailable as to actions proposed prior to the July 9, 1989 effective date of the WPA). In cases involving retirement applications, administrative proceedings were considered "pending" once the applications have been received by the agency. <span class="Italic">Post v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 172, 176 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The interim relief provision, part of the Whistleblower Protection Act, applies to all appeals. It is immaterial to the agency's obligation to provide interim relief that the successful appeal has nothing to do with whistleblowing, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Steinhauer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 487 (1993) (Table), but the interim relief provisions are applicable to Individual Right of Action appeals. <span class="Italic">Costin v. DHHS</span>, 72 MSPR 525, 530-32 (1996), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">O'Regan v. VA</span>, 74 MSPR 134, 138 (1997); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Fahrenbacher v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 500, 506 n.2 (2000) (reserving decision on whether interim relief should be ordered in USERRA cases). The Board encourages its AJs to exercise restraint in granting interim relief in the course of retirement appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steele v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 458, 463-64 (1993). Interim relief provisions apply to Individual Right of Action cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sooter v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> CH-1221-12-0588-W-1 (NP 4/2/2015) (recognizing the statutory grant but not upsetting the AJ's decision not to grant interim relief).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The award of interim relief is discretionary, although it seems to be awarded in most appeals favoring appellants. The statute, 5 USC 7701(b)(2)(A)(i), provides for interim relief unless "the deciding official determines that the granting of such relief is not appropriate." The deciding official is the AJ. Board regulations at 5 CFR 1201.111 (2022), prescribing the requirements of an initial decision, state at &#x00A7; (a)(4) that the initial decision is to include whether interim relief is to be provided to a prevailing party. Although the granting (or denial) of interim relief is within the AJ's discretion, the Board has not yet established by case law the limits of that discretion. If the AJ does not grant interim relief, there is no authority that provides for filing a motion to compel interim relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 296, 300 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Moorer v. DOD</span>, 53 MSPR 581, 583 (1992)). One AJ issued an initial decision favoring the appellant in a removal case, but the AJ denied interim relief. Both parties petitioned for review. The Board issued an "interlocutory order" reversing the AJ's denial of interim relief and granting that remedy during the pendency of its consideration of the parties' petitions. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 62 (1997). Interim relief was not awarded in <span class="Italic">Cole v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 120 MSPR 640, 648 n.5, 2014 MSPB 16 (2014) (involving a removal based on marijuana use; neither the Board's final decision nor the AJ's initial decision stated why interim relief was not ordered). The Board may decide that for a class of cases, e.g., Postal Service reorganization matters, interim relief will be stayed pending final adjudication of appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chaney v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 1 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Transp</span>, 2023 MSPB 18, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2023), considering the language of the interim relief statute, 5 USC 7701(b)(2)(A), determined that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Based on this language, we hold that when an appellant is the prevailing party in an initial decision issued under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b), but the initial decision is silent on the issue of interim relief, the agency is required to provide interim relief by operation of statute. Generally, an agency may only be relieved of this obligation by an affirmative statement in the initial decision that interim relief is not required or by a showing of undue disruption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1665"></span>Notwithstanding this default rule, the expectation remains that the Board's administrative judges will provide an affirmative statement on interim relief as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(4) when the appellant is the prevailing party. However, an administrative judge's omission of such statement does not relieve the agency of its statutory interim relief obligation. An agency that fails to provide interim relief in such a case does so at its own peril and risks having its petition or cross petition for review dismissed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.116(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, regardless of whether an initial decision contains or omits a required statement on interim relief, the Board will exercise its discretionary authority to dismiss an agency's petition or cross petition for review for failure to provide interim relief in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Guillebeau v. Department of the Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329, 1332-33 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (holding that, when an agency fails to comply with an interim relief order, dismissal of a petition for review by the Board is discretionary, not mandatory). Chief among these considerations will be whether the agency undertook good faith, diligent, and competent efforts to satisfy its interim relief obligation. <span class="Italic">See Donovan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 344, 348 (1996). Moreover, the Board has recognized certain situations in which interim relief may not be appropriate, even if the appellant is the prevailing party in the initial decision. These include but are not limited to retirement benefits cases and cases in which the appellant is currently receiving wage loss compensation benefits or a salary from another Federal agency. <span class="Italic">See generally Norton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). If an administrative judge omits an interim relief statement in such a case, the agency should act in good faith according to the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Predating <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, a nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Howell v. DHUD</span>, DC-0432-13-6622-I-2, n.3 (NP 1/18/2023), involving an agency's PFR from reversal of a performance-based action, said of the appellant's objection that the agency did not provide interim relief when the AJ did not order it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant filed a separate motion to dismiss the agency's petition for review because the agency had not provided interim relief. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.116(a) (requiring that an agency's petition for review generally be accompanied by certification that it has provided interim relief, if the initial decision ordered interim relief). The agency filed a response, rightly noting that the administrative judge did not order interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Cole v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 n.5 (2014) (denying an appellant's request to dismiss an agency's petition for review for failing to provide interim relief because the administrative judge did not order interim relief). The appellant then filed a pleading requesting that the Board order immediate interim relief, to which the agency also responded. Because the administrative judge did not order interim relief, his request for such relief is denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interim relief, if ordered by the AJ, applies whether the PFR is filed by the appellant or by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v.

USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 598, 601 (1997) ("[T]he agency's motion for an extension of the petition for review filing deadline and the petition itself make absolutely no reference to the interim relief order, and neither was accompanied by any evidence relating to interim relief.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An interim relief order does not stay an adverse action; the action is still effective until the Board's decision reversing it becomes final. Rather, the interim relief order requires the agency to place the appellant under an interim appointment during the period that a PFR is pending and until the Board issues its final decision in the appeal. Once the Board issues a final decision, the PFR is no longer pending and the interim relief order is no longer in effect. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 536, 548, 551 (1994). The interim relief appointment is a separate, distinct appointment triggering commencement of a waiting period for purposes of step increase (WIGI) determinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fahrenbacher v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 500, 505 &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (in a USERRA nonselection case involving interim relief, the appellant was not entitled to an advancement in step for the period between the date the position was filled and the date of the initial decision); <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 360, 364-65 (1994) (analyzing impact of interim relief upon WIGI waiting period).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies are required to know and abide by the interim relief provisions of the WPA. Before regulatory revisions in 1999 requiring certification, rather than proof, of interim relief, the interim relief process was more complex. If the AJ's orders on interim relief were unclear or contained technical errors, guidance was to be obtained from the AJ or the Board. The alternative was failure by the agency to provide interim relief, followed by the sanction of dismissal of the agency PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Magnusson v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 88, 90-91 (1995). "Where an agency files a PFR of an initial decision that orders the provision of interim relief, the petition must be accompanied by evidence that the agency has either provided the required interim relief, or has made a determination that returning the appellant to the workplace would be unduly disruptive.... An agency's failure to submit such evidence will result in the dismissal of the agency's PFR." <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 439, 441 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Watson v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 260, 262 &#x00B6; 4 (1998); <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 31, 32-33 (1998); <span class="Italic">Briley v. Nat'l Archives and Records Admin.</span>, 71 MSPR 211, 217 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "exclusive" remedy available to an appellant alleging that the agency has not properly effected an interim relief order is to move for dismissal of the agency's PFR under 5 CFR 1201.116(d) (2022). <span class="Italic">Wayne v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 322, 327 (1992) (relying on <span class="Italic">Ginocchi v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 62, 68 n.4 (1992)). The Board does not entertain motions for compliance with an interim relief order. Instead, the appellant's remedy is to move that the Board dismiss the agency's PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 607, 613 (1996) (interim relief provision of the WPA does not result in interim compliance proceedings); <span class="Italic">Grady v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 225, 227 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Ginocchi v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 62, 68 n.4 (1992)). The whole point of dismissing an agency PFR for lack of interim relief is to avoid reaching the merits of the agency's PFR. An exception to the interim relief sanction applies when the AJ improperly orders interim relief. <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 684, 686 n.1 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 92, 96 (1994)). There was a variation on the theme, however. If the appellant prevailed (e.g., by having a demotion reduced to a suspension) and files a PFR, the Board could directly intercede, on the appellant's request, to sort out problems with interim relief even though there was no agency PFR to dismiss. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 337, 339 (1995); <span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 144, 147-48 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not entertain agency motions to stay interim relief, according to <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 468, 472-73 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2013 MSPB 101 (2013), although <span class="Italic">Erickson</span> declined to dismiss the PFR and affirmed the initial decision, mooting the interim relief issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A), an appellant who obtains relief in an initial decision is entitled to the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision and remaining in effect pending the outcome of the petition for review, unless the administrative judge determines that granting such relief is not appropriate. The statute further provides that an employing agency may decline to return the appellant to his or her place of employment pending the outcome of the petition for review if it determines that the presence or return of the employee would be unduly disruptive to the work environment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii). In that event, the appellant must receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms or conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency may challenge the propriety of an interim relief order on petition for review. <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Department of Justice</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 11 (2007). However, neither statute, nor the Board's regulations, contemplate that the Board may stay interim relief or entertain an agency's motion for such a stay. <span class="Italic">Vesser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 648, 650 n.1 (1993), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 29 F.3d 600 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Accordingly, we DENY the agency's motion.</p>
