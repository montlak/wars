<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-120"><span class="space">2.</span> Specificity of Underlying Disclosure; Labeling of Disclosure Not Required</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">At the outset there has to be a whistleblower disclosure to qualify for the protection against reprisal later alleged. The disclosure must be specific. The necessity for careful articulation of whistleblowing allegations was emphasized, <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 540, 543-44 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that on or about September 6, 1991, she filed a "fraud, waste, and abuse" disclosure with Captain Spencer Singleton, an assistant Inspector General at the Kirtland Base....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does include a memorandum dated September 14, 1991, which is apparently the disclosure to which the appellant refers. In this memorandum, the appellant asserts that there is fraud, waste, and abuse in the areas of human resources, equipment and supplies, and pay and travel in the 925th Civil Engineering Squadron. She asserts that there is an excessive preoccupation with personal advancement, that individuals who point out these problems are ostracized, that there is no accountability on any level, and that these conditions have been caused by poor organization, discipline, and management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the appellant's "disclosure" to the Inspector General to be considered to be whistleblowing under the WPA, it must meet the requirements of 5 USC 2302(b)(8).... The appellant has not shown, however, that she had a reasonable belief that she was disclosing a "violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or...gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety," 5 USC 2302(b)(8), when she made the vague allegations of wrongdoing set forth in her memorandum. Her "disclosure" does not set forth any specific law, rule, or regulation that she believes was violated. Nor do her comments regarding broad and imprecise matters, such as an excessive preoccupation with personal advancement, set forth allegations of gross mismanagement or an abuse of authority that would be covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(8). Accordingly, we find that this memorandum does not constitute whistleblowing. Because the appellant has not shown that she engaged in any protected whistleblowing activity, her appeal is properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speculation is not a valid basis for a protected disclosure, <span class="Italic">Yeh v. MSPB</span>, 527 Fed. Appx. 896, 901 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As pled, Yeh's disclosure constitutes unsubstantiated speculation, <span id="Page_3855"></span>which cannot make out a non-frivolous allegation. <span class="Italic">See Kahn</span>, 528 F.3d at 1341 (quoting <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). Her allegations that other employees abused their leave privileges and came to work late are just as speculative. <span class="Italic">See</span> RA 28, 36-37. Given the lack of factual basis adduced by Yeh for these claims, we fail to see how a disinterested observer with her knowledge could conclude such activities were violations of any law, rule or regulation, or gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety under the standards cited herein. <span class="Italic">See Kavanagh</span>, 176 F. App'x at 135; <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, 273 Fed. Appx. at 964; <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 515 F.3d at 1366, 1369. Such an observer could not reasonably conclude that a substantial risk of significant adverse impact to the agency's ability to accomplish its mission resulted, that the rights of any person were adversely affected, that an expenditure was made that was significantly out of proportion to the benefit reasonably expected to accrue, or that there was a likelihood of harm to public safety of health. We therefore again agree with the Board that jurisdiction was not conferred by this allegation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baillie v. Dept. of Energy</span>, DC-1221-20-0838-W-1, n.5 (NP 5/26/2022), determined that disclosures must be pleaded with specificity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In further support of her claim, she alleged that "[Graduate Fellows] with the same education and experience qualifications [as her] have been offered EN-03 positions." She also asserted that other Graduate Fellows were "provided the same offer as [her]" even though they lacked her educational background and related work experience. However, the appellant did not provide any relevant details regarding such individuals or indicate the basis of her statements. Such conclusory and unsubstantiated speculation is insufficient to amount to a nonfrivolous allegation that the appellant reasonably believed the agency made the same or different offers to other Graduate Fellows. <span class="Italic">Chambers v.

<p class="Body-Text">Disclosures to an agency IG may constitute whistleblowing whether the disclosures are made through a complaint by the appellant or in response to an inquiry initiated by the IG. The appellant need not characterize the misconduct she reports for the report to qualify for whistleblowing protection. A description of events, rather than a series of allegations pinned to specific statutory whistleblowing terminology, may qualify for statutory protection, <span class="Italic">Williams v. NLRB</span>, 59 MSPR 640, 644-46 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant specifically asserts in her petition for review...that her disclosures to the IG during the investigation came under the umbrella of whistleblowing; she claims that she had collected information about her supervisor and intended to give it to the agency after she found new employment, primarily to avoid retaliation for her disclosures. She contends that she was not required to state any "magic words," i.e., she did not have to specify the law, rule, or regulation, which she believed applied to her disclosures. Thus, she essentially proffers that she reasonably believed that she was whistleblowing when she was questioned by the IG. Finally, the appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly "lowered the burden of proof for the agency, not the appellant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the Board to have jurisdiction over this IRA appeal, the appellant has to establish, among other things, that she engaged in protected whistleblowing activities as defined by 5 USC 2302(b) (8)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Department of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 540, 543 (1992). The administrative judge found that the appellant had not characterized her supervisor's alleged misconduct as a violation of law or as any of the other types of impropriety as set forth in the definition of whistleblowing. The administrative judge also relied on the deposition testimony offered by the appellant wherein she stated that she "wasn't even sure whether [Mr. Parker's activities constituted] misconduct." He therefore found that the appellant did not believe that her disclosures evidenced any of the matters described in 5 USC 2302(b)(8) or that she was engaged in whistleblowing at the time she participated in the IG's investigation. Consequently, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant's disclosures to the IG did not constitute whistleblowing under 5 USC 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that this holding is too restrictive. The label or characterization an employee gives to her disclosure does not determine whether it constitutes whistleblowing. Rather, the content of the disclosure and the reasonableness of her belief that it evidences wrongdoing are the determinative factors. Among other things, the appellant disclosed that she had obtained information from various sources indicating that Parker, her supervisor, was conducting personal business on work time, that he was using government equipment and personnel to help himself, and that he was not completing leave slips for times he was out of the office on personal business or for medical care. We also note that the Counsel to the agency's IG, in a letter to OSC dated December 2, 1992, stated that the IG had issued a report in May 1992 which found that a number of the appellant's allegations had merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's disclosures clearly involved information indicating that her supervisor was acting in a manner contrary to basic government rules and regulations. Thus, we must determine whether "a person with the information the appellant had could well have reasonably concluded" that there was wrongdoing within the ambit of section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Nafus v. Department of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 386, 397 (1993). We find that the appellant has met this reasonableness test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the appellant does not meet the test because she did not seek out the IG to disclose her information, but, instead, merely cooperated with the investigation as requested. We disagree. The difference between sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9) as relevant here is not whether the employee or the IG makes the initial contact but whether the disclosures made to the IG rise to the level of whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the appellant made a number of accusations that are both lacking in detail and unsupported by any evidence in the record. For example, he made no allegation of the facts that led him to conclude that the agency hired candidates who retire before they can be fully trained, or hired unqualified candidates. He did not cite any particular employee who was unqualified or who retired while still in training. He also did not cite any particular vacancy that remained open while the agency "shopped" for a particular applicant to fill it. Instead, he alleged that the agency denied him consideration for over 100 vacancies for which he was qualified. He did not identify those vacancies, but asserted that the agency was withholding information about them.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge did not properly consider one of his disclosures concerning allegedly improperly-run electrical cords. The inquiry into whether a disclosed danger is sufficiently "substantial and specific" to warrant protection under the Whistleblower Protection Act is guided by several factors, including: (1) The likelihood of harm resulting from the danger; (2) when the alleged harm may occur; and (3) the nature of the harm, i.e., the potential consequences. <span class="Italic">See Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 515 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge did not err in finding that the appellant's allegations concerning the power and extension cords did not contain facts that a reasonable person would conclude presented a substantial and specific danger. He contends that the cords would "eventually" lead to wear-induced shorts and "possibly" fires and electrocutions. However, the likelihood of such harm occurring was significantly averted when the appellant himself repositioned the cords to eliminate any risk in that regard. <span class="Italic">See Chambers</span>, 515 F.3d at 1369 (if the disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, the disclosure should not enjoy protection; a harm likely to occur in the immediate or near future should identify a protected disclosure much more than a harm likely to manifest only in the distant future).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he made a protected disclosure, i.e., that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have believed that the matters disclosed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See Sinko v.

He also alleged in general terms that the agency violated the law, obstructed justice, breached a contract, committed perjury, engaged in conflicts of interest, workplace violence and retaliation, and created a hostile work environment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e agree with the ALJ that the anonymous letter's bare allegation that the respondent was a poor supervisor is no evidence of gross mismanagement and could not reasonably be believed to be so. Petitioner's effort to bootstrap this conclusory assertion into a protected disclosure by reference to subsequent investigatory findings concerning matters not mentioned in the letter is a misguided one. Petitioner cites <span class="Italic">Gores v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 100 (1995), as holding that subsequent substantiation of an allegation supports its reasonableness for purposes of protection under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Gores</span> is distinguishable, however, because the disclosures at issue in that case were specific factual allegations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 107.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the matters disclosed in <span class="Italic">Gores</span>, the anonymous letter's assertion did not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of gross mismanagement. <span class="Italic">See Sobczak v.

We do not believe the statute should be read to protect name calling and conclusory accusations on the theory that someone might have made disclosures which could reasonably have been believed to support such charges. Under the circumstances here, findings of mismanagement which are not contained in any form in the anonymous letter do not confer protected status on it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The division between conclusory and nonconclusory allegations can be difficult to define or discern, but the Board considered jurisdictionally inadequate a variety of assertions in <span class="Italic">McCorcle v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of a disclosure that he reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, or an abuse of authority. As a general matter, the majority of the appellant's alleged disclosures are conclusory allegations lacking in specificity and, as such, <span id="Page_3857"></span>do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations of IRA jurisdiction. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Keefer</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 687 &#x00B6; 10. For example, the appellant's bare allegation that the agency engaged in "[I]ncidents of harassment and discrimination...too numerous to list on three pages[,]" without more, does not constitute a specific and detailed disclosure of a violation of law, rule, or regulation, protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).

Department of Defense</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 172, 181 (1994) (the appellant's broad and imprecise assertions that he was being harassed and subjected to a stressful work environment failed to set forth allegations of a protected disclosure). Further, alleged disclosures that an agency has engaged in discrimination and a pattern of harassment and created a hostile work environment in violation of title VII are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and (b)(9) and are excluded from coverage under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Applewhite v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 300 &#x00B6; 23 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the appellant alleged facts sufficient to establish a nonfrivolous allegation that he disclosed gross mismanagement. "Gross mismanagement" is a decision that creates a "substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission." <span class="Italic">Coons v. Department of the Navy</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 485, 488 (1994). First, most of the appellant's comments in his letters to government officials reporting managerial "irregularities" are so broad, nonspecific, and vague that they do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations of gross mismanagement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Costello</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 562, 584-85 (1997) (the appellant's letter did not contain a single example to support his bare allegation of mismanagement and was therefore not a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 182 F.3d 1372 (Fed.

Second, the appellant's contention that the agency wasted his time and expertise when it allegedly assigned him clerical and other duties does not qualify as a disclosure of gross mismanagement. A disclosure questioning management decisions that are merely debatable or just simple negligence or wrongdoing, with no element of blatancy" is not protected as a disclosure of "gross mismanagement." <span class="Italic">Sazinski v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 682, 686-87 (1997). The appellant's allegations here appear to reveal nothing more than his disagreement with agency policy, i.e., the assignment of job duties and responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Accord, e.g., id.</span>, at 686-87 (1997). Further, the appellant has not asserted nonfrivolous allegations of facts sufficient to indicate that he reasonably believed his alleged performance of clerical and other duties would have a substantial adverse impact on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant's allegation that agency officials engaged in an "abuse of authority" suffers the same flaw as the majority of the disclosures discussed above. "Abuse of authority" occurs when there is an "arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or that results in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred other persons." <span class="Italic">Embree</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 85. On appeal, the appellant contended that the actions of his supervisors evidenced an abuse of authority because they were "arbitrary and capricious, as well as discriminatory...." In his letters, the appellant alleged that his superiors "fabricated" conduct charges against him "in a conspiratorial act" "master-minded" by two Area Veterinarians. He further contended that "upper management" "controlled [and] manipulated" "employee efforts to redress grievances." These vague allegations of wrongdoing, lacking in specific detail, fail to rise to the level of nonfrivolous allegations of a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Costello</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. at 580, 585-86. Taken as a whole, the appellant's rambling allegations of abuses of authority are fundamentally his own personal complaints and grievances about how he was treated by the agency or mere debatable disagreements with the agency's policy decisions and therefore do constitute not a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (the WPA "is intended to protect government employees who risk their own personal job security for the advancement of the public good by disclosing abuses by government personnel"); <span class="Italic">Frederick v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 F.3d 349, 353 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (the purpose of the WPA is to "root out real wrongdoing"; the WPA was not designed as a remedy for employee grievances). Further, insofar as the appellant claims that the agency engaged in discrimination and a pattern of harassment and created a hostile work environment in violation of title VII, such disclosures are not ones that a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced an "abuse of authority" under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Applewhite,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 300 &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that, while the appellant exhausted his OSC remedy and raised nonfrivolous allegations that he was the subject of covered personnel actions, the written record shows that he has not raised a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a protected disclosure.

It is well settled, however, that vague and imprecise allegations of agency wrongdoing, lacking in specificity, do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations of a protected disclosure sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McCorcle v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 21 (2005) (bare allegation that the agency engaged in "[I]ncidents of harassment and discrimination...too numerous to list on three pages," without more, did not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a specific and detailed disclosure protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)); <span class="Italic">Carr v. Department of Defense</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 172, 181 (1994) (appellant's broad and imprecise allegations that he was being harassed and subjected to a stressful work environment failed to set forth allegations of a protected disclosure).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's allegations of mistreatment by Ms. Russell and Mr. Culhane are vague and conclusory. For example, the appellant alleges that Ms. Russell verbally abused her and harassed her, and that Mr. Culhane mocked and berated her; however, she does not explain what was said to her. Thus, we find that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her disclosures regarding her alleged mistreatment by Ms. Russell and Mr. Culhane were protected. Furthermore, to the extent these disclosures relate to the appellant's allegations of age and sex discrimination, they are protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and (b)(9), not &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See McCorcle</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although whistleblowing allegations should be specific, they need not constitute factual pleadings. In <span class="Italic">Keefer v. USDA</span>, 82 MSPR 687, 690-91 &#x00B6; 4 (1999), appellants asserted that they were the victims of reprisal after they made scores of disclosures of waste and violations of laws with regard to the agency's enforcement of timber theft and fraud in the national forests. The AJ required that to qualify for protection, the appellants demonstrate that their whistleblowing disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">must provide a description of the misconduct which is adequate to allow the recipient of the disclosure to initiate a reasonably well focused investigation of the alleged misconduct. A statement which cannot lead to such an investigation without the intermediate step of returning to the employee to ask for a more specific explanation does not constitute "information" which "evidences" misconduct and is not a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board concluded that the AJ imposed too high a standard of specificity in the disclosure process, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 693-94:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]his reasoning added an additional requirement not supported by the statute and case law. The statute does not contain a requirement that a disclosure be made with such specificity as to enable the recipient of the disclosure to conduct an investigation without having to return to the employee for additional information. Rather, the statute provides simply that it is a prohibited personnel practice to take a personnel action against an employee for any disclosure of information which the employee reasonably believes evidences behavior described under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Further, it is well established that the WPA is remedial legislation, intended to improve protections for federal employees, and should be construed to effectuate that purpose. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 71 MSPR 22, 32 (1996). Placing a new burden on an appellant to prove an extra element relative to the disclosure being made does not effectuate that purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board has found that the statute protects "any disclosure" that meets the "reasonable belief" test and otherwise falls within its coverage, and that it could not add jurisdictional requirements not found in the statute. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears,</span> 75 MSPR 639, 654, 660 (1997). It appears that Congress intended to protect even partial disclosures, provided the information disclosed is sufficient to support a reasonable inference of wrongdoing despite the possibility that examination of all the facts would ultimately reveal that the actions were not improper. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 660. While the case law requires that disclosures contain a degree of specificity, the case law has not required the additional specificity element set forth in the administrative judge's standard. Therefore, to the extent the administrative judge's standard focused on the <span class="Italic">recipient</span> of the alleged protected disclosure, it is incorrect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The test to determine whether a putative whistleblower has a reasonable belief in the disclosure is an objective one; whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions of the agency evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety<span class="Italic">. Lachance <span id="Page_3858"></span>v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Once the appellants make nonfrivolous allegations that their alleged disclosures meet the standard set forth at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A), the question of whether they reasonably believed that their disclosures constituted protected whistleblowing is a matter to be determined after they have been afforded a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Ayers v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 79 MSPR 19, 23-24 n. (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mogyorossy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 96 MSPR 652, 658 &#x00B6; 7 (2004) ("[t]here is no statutory jurisdictional requirement that a whistleblower disclosure be made with such specificity as to enable the recipient of the disclosure to conduct an investigation without having to return to the employee for additional information[.]").
