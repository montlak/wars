<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-112"><span class="space">t.</span> Employee of Agency Other Than the Agency Charged With Reprisal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Whistleblowing reprisal cases ordinarily involved reprisal against employees of the agency accused of reprisal. But in <span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEED_ALVERN_C_DE_1221_09_0320_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_473250.pdf">113 MSPR 221</a>, 224-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 8-12, 2010 MSPB 23 (2010), the appellant was employed by the Air Force and complained to OSC that the Social Security Administration was violating laws or regulations concerning appointments to SSA positions, with the effect of excluding the appellant from consideration for those positions. The appellant then filed a Board appeal asserting that SSA took reprisal for the OSC complaint by excluding him from consideration for additional SSA <span id="Page_3847"></span>positions, essentially precluding him from applying for the jobs, through the agency's use of FCIP appointments. The Board determined that Mr. Weed had standing to bring his appeal as an "employee," even though he was not an SSA employee or applicant for the SSA positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a 10-point compensable preference-eligible veteran, filed a 2005 Board appeal (MSPB Docket No. DE-3443-05-0248-I-1) under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) alleging that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights when it made no selection from a vacancy announcement for two Social Insurance Specialist Claims Representative positions in the agency's Montana Field Office in Kalispell, Montana, and instead non-competitively selected two non-preference eligible applicants for the positions under the Outstanding Scholar Program....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While his first appeal was pending, on June 27, 2006, the appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), wherein he alleged that the agency's use of the Outstanding Scholar Program to fill the positions in the Montana Field Office was a prohibited personnel practice because there is no statutory or regulatory authority for the program and because the agency violated the implementation instructions issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) when it used the program to fill the positions. In the OSC complaint, the appellant stated that he was a GS-1102-11 Lead Contract Specialist, who was employed by the Department of the Air Force at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently filed a second Board appeal in September 2008 alleging that the agency violated veterans' preference rules, discriminated against him in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), and retaliated against him for his successful Board appeal and an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) appeal. <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 320 (2009). In the appeal, the appellant asserted that the agency, without public notice, used the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) to non-competitively fill four additional positions in Kalispell, Montana, that were comparable to the positions in his first appeal. The appellant did not apply for any of the positions, but he alleged that he was unaware of the vacancies and that the agency used FCIP as an "intentional artifice" to exclude him from the opportunity to compete for the positions. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 3. The administrative judge docketed the cases as separate appeals under VEOA and USERRA, and ordered the appellant to show that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeals. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 4. After receiving jurisdictional submissions from the parties, the administrative judge dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the appellant had not been an applicant for any of the positions at issue, and, therefore, he could not make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under VEOA or USERRA. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 5. The appellant petitioned for review of the IDs, and we reversed the IDs, found the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's claims under VEOA and USERRA, and remanded the appeals for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 13, 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he was an "employee" in the federal civil service, i.e., a GS-1102-11 Lead Contract Specialist with the Department of the Air Force, in 2006 and 2007 when the FCIP positions were filled, and because he also should have been considered an applicant for employment with the agency continuously since he had filed his original application with the agency in 2005. The appellant further argues that, for the purposes of the WPA, an "appointment" is a "personnel action" and he is alleging in this appeal that the agency failed to appoint him to a position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). With regard to IRA appeals, the Board has jurisdiction over whistleblower claims filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). Section 1221(a) provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8), seek corrective action from [the Board].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). In section 2302(b)(8), the statute prohibits any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action to</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(B)(i). It is well established that the WPA is a remedial statute, and we are required to construe its terms broadly. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fishbein v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 8 (2006) (because the WPA is remedial legislation, the Board will construe its provisions liberally to embrace all cases fairly within its scope, so as to effectuate the purpose of the Act). Further, our reviewing court has found that the language used in section 2302(b)(8) indicates that Congress's intent was to legislate in "broad terms" and that, "absent some exclusionary language, a cramped reading of the statute...would be counter to that intent." <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 508 F.3d 674, 677 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i), a reasonable belief that a violation of law is imminent is sufficient to confer jurisdiction and protected disclosures, thus, may include potential violations of law not carried out by the agency). Here, the plain language in the statute does not impose a limitation or use exclusionary language stating that a protected employee must work for the agency taking the alleged retaliatory personnel action. Therefore, we find that the appellant, as a current employee of the Department of the Air Force, met the definition of being an "employee" as contemplated by the statute when he filed his initial complaint with OSC and when the agency filled the subject positions using FCIP. <span class="Italic">See Fishbein</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 12 (to be an employee under the WPA, an individual must meet the general definition of "employee" under title 5, U.S. Code, as established at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found below, and the agency contends on review, that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal because he was never an employee of the agency that took the "personnel action. In support of this argument, the agency contends that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) requires that a "personnel action" under the statute must be taken with respect to an "employee" in a covered position with the employing agency. Section 2302(a)(2)(A) states that, for the purpose of this section-</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; "personnel action" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;an appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;a promotion;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;an action under chapter 75 of this title or other disciplinary or corrective action;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(xi)&#x2003;any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">with respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position in an agency, and in the case of an alleged prohibited personnel practice described in subsection (b)(8), an employee or applicant for employment in a Government corporation as defined in section 9101 of title 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). We find that Congress's intent in drafting this provision was to protect whistleblowers from a broad range of possible retaliatory actions from government agencies. In particular, the pertinent language here, i.e., a personnel action means an appointment taken "with respect to an employee in...a covered position in an agency," does not impose a limitation or use exclusionary language stating that a protected employee must work for the agency taking the alleged retaliatory personnel action. Indeed, although many of the "personnel actions" listed above are ones that can be taken only by the employing agency of a whistleblower, there are several listed actions, such as a transfer, a detail, a restoration, and a reemployment, where another federal agency could be the authority taking the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(18) (defining a transfer as a change of an employee, without a break in service, from a position in one agency to a position in another agency); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 317.903 (defining a detail in the Senior Executive Service to include a temporary assignment to an outside agency); 5 C.F.R. Part 330, subpart G and Part 553 (authorizing a restoration or a reemployment of former employees to include placement in a position in another agency). Thus, the definition of "employee" and "personnel action" advocated by the agency is unduly restrictive because it would deny recourse to federal employees who are claiming whistleblower retaliation for personnel actions identified in the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3848"></span>On review, the agency also relies on <span class="Italic">Guzman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. 927, 929 (Fed. Cir. 2002), which is a non-precedential decision finding that a substantive violation of the WPA under section 2302(b)(8) must be taken against an "employee" or "applicant for employment," and not a "former employee." The Board may follow non-precedential decisions by our reviewing court to the extent that we find them to be persuasive. <span class="Italic">Worley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 8 (2000). However, the court's decision in Guzman did not restrict the definition of "employee" to individuals who have worked for the agency that took the alleged retaliatory personnel action. In <span class="Italic">Guzman</span>, the appellant had been employed by the Department of the Air Force in the Philippines. She alleged whistleblower retaliation by OPM when it denied her post-separation retirement application, arguing that OPM had misinterpreted the Civil Service Retirement System statute to find her ineligible for retirement. <span class="Italic">Guzman</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. at 928. The court found that, under the plain language in the WPA, although former employees may file appeals for corrective action, their appeals must concern personnel actions that occurred while they were an "employee" or "applicant for employment" with the federal government. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 929. There is no language in the decision, however, indicating that jurisdiction was lacking because the appellant was not an employee of OPM, or that the appellant's employing agency, i.e., the Air Force, had taken no action in the appeal. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Guzman</span> does not provide persuasive analysis that the term "employee" in the WPA is restricted to the individuals who are employed by the agency taking the personnel action. It only provides that a former employee's appeal rights are limited to actions taken while they were in the status of being an employee or applicant for employment. <span class="Italic">See also Pasley v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 105, &#x00B6; 10 (2008) (finding the termination of a former federal employee by a private sector employer allegedly taken in retaliation for his protected disclosures during federal employment did not meet the definition of "personnel action" under the WPA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, contrary to the agency's argument, a whistleblower does not need to be an employee, an applicant for employment or a former employee at the time he made his protected disclosures. In <span class="Italic">Greenup v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 6 (2007), we found that a former Program Technician with a County Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Committee, who had been a county employee and not a federal employee, could raise an IRA appeal alleging that the agency denied her an appointment to a federal position because of whistleblower protected disclosures that she made while a county employee. In <span class="Italic">Greenup</span>, we determined that the statute does not specify that a disclosure must have been made when the individual seeking protection was either an employee or an applicant for employment. 106 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 8. Indeed, we noted that, in the case of applicants for employment, who are not federal employees at any time prior to their application, such a limitation would severely restrict any recourse they might otherwise have, since the disclosure would necessarily have to be made while their application was pending. Thus, we found that Congress did not intend to grant such a limited right of review, when it determined to protect applicants for employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
