<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's contentions that the deciding official committed perjury and that the agency failed to produce relevant documents during the discovery process and find that these claims do not rise to the level of fraud. The appellant contends that the deciding official erroneously testified that the agency investigator was the deciding official and that the agency concealed an email from his mentally ill wife. Even if these allegations were true, they do not constitute fraud because they do not substantially change the posture of the case. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 355....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may exercise its discretionary authority to reopen a case, despite judicial review proceedings and despite the passage of a considerable time between the Board's decision and the reopening petition, if it can be demonstrated that a party's evidence fraudulently induced the result reached by the Board. In an appeal affirming dismissals of air traffic controllers for striking, a congressional investigation subsequent to the Board and judicial review proceedings suggested that some documentation relied upon by FAA before the MSPB was altered. The congressional oversight committee called for further investigation by executive branch agencies. A reopening petition was filed with the Board. The Board determined that the alterations in documents were neither fraudulent nor material to the outcome of the case. The decision touched on the Board's authority to reopen, the effect of judicial review proceedings, and a comparison of the materials relied on in the congressional investigation and the evidence contained in the Board's record, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 348-53 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board's Authority to Reopen Appeals</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has statutory and regulatory authority to reopen, on its own motion, appeals in which it has rendered a final decision. 5 USC 7701(e)(1)(B); 5 CFR 1201.117; <span class="Italic">see Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 194-95 (1985). Such authority is consistent with the general rule that administrative agencies have the power to reconsider decisions on their own initiative, as long as proper notice is given and the right is exercised within a reasonably short period of time<span class="Italic">. Dawson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 712 F.2d 264, 266-67 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 194.[24] The Board has held further that a determination of whether to reopen and reconsider a decision involves "balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result." <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 195.[25]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[24] <span class="Italic">See also Civil Aeronautics Board v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.</span>, 367 U.S. 316, 321 (1961); <span class="Italic">Bookman v. United States</span>, 453 F.2d 1263, 1265 (Ct. Cl. 1972).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[25] <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 7 MSPR 357, 359-60 (1981) (noting that the only standard uniformly agreed on to judge petitions for reconsideration is "clear and material legal error" and that, "to warrant reconsideration, the new evidence must be likely to change substantially the posture of the case; it is not sufficient that it updates the record or that it provides some new insight into the matters at issue").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the extent of a "reasonably short period of time," the Board ruled in <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Government Printing Office</span>, 43 MSPR 346, 351 (1990), that it varies with the circumstances. The Board nonetheless found that, "absent unusual circumstances, the time period would be measured in weeks, not years," quoting <span class="Italic">Mazaleski v. Treusdale</span>, 562 F.2d 701, 720 (D.C. Cir. 1977). As to the <span class="Italic">Marshall</span> appeal itself, the Board concluded that, despite the existence of an intervening Federal court of appeals decision allegedly modifying the authority of the Board to order reinstatement and back pay, as it had in that appeal, "considerations of finality dictate that this case not be reopened 3 years after the decision on the merits." <span class="Italic">Marshall</span> at 351.[26]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[26] <span class="Italic">See also Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 P. Supp. 62, 66 (D.D.C. 1987) ("The Court is aware of no case that supports the proposition that the MSPB may reopen a prior final decision years after it was issued, and <span class="Italic">after the completion of EEOC review</span>.") (Emphasis in original.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One exception to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, however, allows reopening as a matter of discretion where the earlier decision was obtained by fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation by a party. The Board has extended this exception to its own proceedings<span class="Italic">. See Kissel v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 MSPR 154, 157-59 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, under this exception, the Board has the authority to reopen and reconsider a final decision that it has rendered, even after several years have passed, where there has been fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation by a party before the Board. Such circumstances shift the balance from the "desirability of finality" to "the public interest in reaching the right result," <span class="Italic">see Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 195, and thus warrant reopening and reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite all of this previous litigation of the appellants' claims of fraudulent evidentiary submissions before the Board, they still make only <span class="Italic">general</span> assertions of misrepresentation and deceit. Even now, not one appellant has asserted that any particular piece of evidence in his adverse action file was incorrect or falsified as to the period of strike participation charged against him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "fraud" exception to the requirement that a reopening petition be promptly filed does not license appellants to reopen their cases through superficial allegations of fraudulent conduct by their employing agencies. The Board examines the essence of the allegation to determine what the appellant is asserting and how the assertion affects the result she now challenges. In <span class="Italic">Nagel v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 371, 374-75 (1996), although the appellant sought to reopen a Board decision approving a settlement agreement, the Board declined to reopen the appeal because the appellant's real concern involved the adjudication of her disability retirement case then pending before the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner raises various questions about her removal by the FAA, and, in order to challenge the FAA's implementation of OPM's regulations in removing her, she has requested the Board to reopen her appeal of that action. The appeal was dismissed in a decision which became final on September 21, 1992. The Board has authority to reopen a final decision <span id="Page_1657"></span>on its own motion under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B), but in the interest of finality the Board will exercise this authority only within a reasonably short period of time after issuance of the decision and not years later, as in this case. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 348-49 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). Petitioner has invoked the exception to this rule favoring finality which the Board discussed in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>: the Board may reopen where the earlier decision was obtained by fraud, concealment, or misrepresentation by a party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 349. According to the petitioner, the settlement agreement which was the basis for the Board's dismissal of her removal appeal could have been obtained by misinformation, deception, or fraud. Petitioner asserts that the FAA had reasonable grounds to believe that she was "in a volatile state of mind which rendered [her] unable to exercise a choice intelligently." Since petitioner states that "severe mental illness" was the disabling medical condition on which her removal was based, she apparently is contending that the FAA took unfair advantage of her mental state in reaching an agreement with her to cancel the removal in return for her resignation and that this is a sufficient basis to reopen her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement if the party believes the agreement was involuntary or the result of fraud. <span class="Italic">See Wade v. VA</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 583 (1994). When an appellant alleges emotional distress or mental disturbance as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board considers whether at the time of the agreement the appellant was represented and whether the appellant has shown mental impairment or inability to understand the nature of the agreement or to assist his or her representative in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Shod v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 214, 219 (1995). In this proceeding, the petitioner has not provided evidence to show that she suffered from a mental disability at the time of the agreement which prevented her from freely entering into an agreement. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. DHHS</span>, 57 MSPR 16, 20 (1993). But even assuming that the appellant could make such a showing, we are persuaded that it would be inappropriate to reopen her appeal challenging her removal. Petitioner's argument here assumes the disabling condition which was the basis for the removal, and, in requesting the Board to reopen, she has not contended that she should be reinstated in her former position. Rather, it is evident that what petitioner is seeking is a disability retirement annuity. Indeed, her appeal of OPM's decision denying her application for a disability annuity is currently pending. <span class="Italic">Nagel v.</span> <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, MSPB Docket No. SL-844E-960034-I-1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her submissions, petitioner attempts to raise questions about the relationship between an employee's removal based on inability to perform because of a medical condition and the employee's entitlement to a disability retirement annuity. Her real concern seems to be that in her disability retirement appeal she should be accorded the evidentiary presumption of disability to which an employee who was removed for medical inability to perform is entitled under <span class="Italic">Bruner v. OPM</span>, 996 F.2d 290 (Fed. Cir. 1993). This is an argument which should be presented to the administrative judge in that case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Smith v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-11-0001-I-1 (NP 5/23/2011) ("In his petition for review, the appellant argues that the agency submitted fraudulent evidence. Specifically, he claims that, in the proceeding below, the agency submitted records relating to a different person. In fact, in its prehearing submissions, the agency did submit Office of Workers' Compensation Programs records for an individual whose name is similar to the appellant's but who was born on a different date. The administrative judge described those documents in her review of the evidence. However, she did not specifically rely upon them in reaching her conclusion that, notwithstanding the appellant's claim of disability discrimination, he failed to establish that the agency did not completely rescind the removal action and that his appeal must be dismissed as moot. Therefore, to the extent the administrative judge erred in considering that evidence, her error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).").</p>
