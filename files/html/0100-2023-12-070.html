<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-70"><span class="space">4.</span> Proposals Covered by Existing Provisions of Agreement; Midterm Bargaining Obligations; Permissive Subjects of Bargaining</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's approach to resolution of negotiability disputes encumbered by "covered by" defenses is not always clear. FLRA's regulations defining the negotiability process state, 5 CFR 2424.2 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Definitions.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this part, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Bargaining obligation dispute</span> means a disagreement between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning whether, in the specific circumstances involved in a particular case, the parties are obligated to bargain over a proposal that otherwise may be negotiable. Examples of bargaining obligation disputes include disagreements between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning agency claims that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;A proposal concerns a matter that is covered by a collective bargaining agreement; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Bargaining is not required over a change in bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment because the effect of the change is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Negotiability dispute</span> means a disagreement between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning the legality of a proposal or provision. A negotiability dispute exists when an exclusive representative disagrees with an agency contention that (without regard to any bargaining obligation dispute) a proposal is outside the duty to bargain, including disagreement with an agency contention that a proposal is bargainable only at its election. A negotiability dispute also exists when an exclusive representative disagrees with an agency head's disapproval of a provision as contrary to law. A negotiability dispute may exist where there is no bargaining obligation dispute. Examples of negotiability disputes include disagreements between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning whether a proposal or provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Affects a management right under 5 U.S.C. 7106(a);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Constitutes a procedure or appropriate arrangement, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(2) and (3), respectively; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Is consistent with a Government-wide regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Petition for review</span> means an appeal filed with the Authority by an exclusive representative requesting resolution of a negotiability dispute. An appeal that concerns only a bargaining obligation dispute may not be resolved under this part.</p>
<p class="noindent">5 CFR 2424.30 (2022), concerning the election between ULP and negotiability procedures, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusive representative has filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice</span>. Except for proposals or provisions that are the subject of an agency's compelling need claim under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(2), where an exclusive representative files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and the charge or grievance concerns issues directly related to the petition for review filed pursuant to this part, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. The dismissal will be without prejudice to the right of the exclusive representative to refile the petition for review after the unfair labor practice charge or grievance has been resolved administratively, including resolution pursuant to an arbitration award that has become final and binding. No later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the unfair labor practice charge or grievance is resolved administratively, the exclusive representative may refile the petition for review, and the Authority will determine whether resolution of the petition is still required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusive representative has not filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice. </span>Where an exclusive representative files only a petition for review under this part, the petition will be processed as follows:</p>

If the exclusive representative does not file an unfair labor practice charge or grievance, the Authority will proceed to resolve all disputes necessary for disposition of the petition unless, in its discretion, the Authority determines that resolving all disputes is not appropriate because, for example, resolution of the bargaining obligation dispute under this part would unduly delay resolution of the negotiability dispute, or the procedures in another, available administrative forum are better suited to resolve the bargaining obligation dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Central to FLRA's analysis may be the final phrase of its definition of a <span id="Page_456"></span>negotiability dispute: "[a]n appeal that concerns <span class="Italic">only</span> a bargaining obligation dispute may not be resolved under this part." [emphasis supplied]</p>
<p class="noindent">Bargaining over a proposal is not required if the subject matter is covered by an existing contract. The "covered by" defense presents a dispute over the obligation to bargain. If that dispute is resolved against the union, FLRA need not analyze other reasons argued by the agency as to a proposal's negotiability. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-108.html">72 FLRA 556</a>, 557 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring; Chairman DuBester dissenting), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 3.b (1) is covered by Article 26, Section 3(A) of the parties' agreement, (2) is beyond the scope of the proposed change, (3) interferes with management's right to assign work and direct employees, and (4) is not an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Under &#x00A7; 2424.2(d) of the Authority's Regulations, if a proposal raises both a bargaining-obligation dispute and a negotiability dispute, then the Authority may resolve the bargaining-obligation dispute.[28] Furthermore, the Authority may resolve only the bargaining-obligation dispute if doing so establishes that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain.[29] For the reasons below, resolving the Agency's covered-by objection fully disposes of Proposal 3.b, so we need not address the Agency's remaining arguments.[30]</p>

<p class="noindent">If the only objection raised by the agency to a negotiability petition is that the proposal is "covered by" an existing agreement, that is, there is no issue raised as to infringement of management rights or other negotiability impediment, FLRA will dismiss the petition without a negotiability determination, leaving the parties to sort out their dispute over the underlying bargaining obligation through means other than a negotiability appeal, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA Roslindale</span>, 65 FLRA 924, 927 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7117 of the Statute and &#x00A7; 2424.2 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will consider a petition for review of a negotiability dispute only when it has been established that the parties are in dispute as to whether a proposal is inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's only claim with regard to Proposal 27 is that it is "covered by" Article 4, Appendix A, Section VI of the CBA. In the absence of an Agency contention that the Union's proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it is inconsistent with law, rule or regulation, it does not appear that there is an issue before the Authority that is appropriate for resolution in a negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council 214</span>, 53 FLRA 131, 132 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, the Agency's claim that the proposal is "covered by" Article 4, Appendix A, Section VI of the CBA raises a bargaining obligation dispute, which is defined in &#x00A7; 2424.2(a) of the Authority's Regulations as a disagreement between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning whether, in the specific circumstances involved in a particular case, the parties are obligated to bargain over a proposal that otherwise may be negotiable. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.2(a). The Authority's Regulations specify that a bargaining obligation dispute includes a claim that a proposal "concerns a matter that is covered by a collective bargaining agreement[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.2(a)(1). Under &#x00A7; 2424.30(b)(2), the Authority has discretion to resolve bargaining obligation issues when they are ancillary to the resolution of whether a proposal is inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.30(b)(2); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2143</span>, 48 FLRA 41, 43-44 (1993) (Member Talkin concurring as to another matter) (claimed existence of duty to bargain questions did not preclude determining negotiability of proposals that were otherwise properly before Authority). However, the Authority's Regulations further specify that a negotiability appeal "that concerns only a bargaining obligation dispute may not be resolved [in a negotiability proceeding]." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.2(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency does not claim that the Union's proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it is inconsistent with law, rule or regulation, there is no issue before the Authority as to Proposal 27 that is appropriate for resolution in a negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council 214</span>, 53 FLRA at 132. Consequently, as the only issue raised by the Agency with regard to Proposal 27 is a bargaining obligation dispute, we dismiss the petition as to Proposal 27. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Air Traffic Controllers Ass'n, Local ZHU</span>, 65 FLRA 738, 741 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">As noted in the <span class="Italic">Guide to the Federal Labor Relations Authority Negotiability Appeals Process, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/102599">www.flra.gov/102599</a>, if the negotiability appeal presents both a negotiability issue and a bargaining dispute centering on the "covered by" defense, FLRA may consider and resolve both aspects of the case under current law. <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 62 FLRA 174, 176-77 (2007), provides an example of the resolution of both disputes in a negotiability appeal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority stated, in<span class="Italic"> Professional Airways Systems Specialists</span>, 56 FLRA 798 (2000) (<span class="Italic">PASS</span>), that two types of disputes may be raised in negotiability proceedings: (1) negotiability disputes, which involve a disagreement between the parties concerning the legality of a proposal; and (2) bargaining obligation disputes, which involve a disagreement concerning whether the parties are obligated to bargain over a proposal that otherwise is negotiable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 803; <span class="Italic">see </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2424.2(a), (c) (defining negotiability and bargaining obligation disputes); <span class="Italic">NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 437, 441-42 (2006). An example of a bargaining obligation dispute is a claim by an agency that a proposal concerns a matter that is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.2(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Proposal 1, the Agency has raised a negotiability dispute that the proposal is contrary to law because it would require the Agency to disclose information that is protected from disclosure. It has also raised a bargaining obligation dispute that the matter is "covered by" the parties' national agreement. The Agency's negotiability issue has been resolved in addressing its objections to the meaning of the proposal. The proposal is limited to requiring the disclosure of information that the Agency has an obligation to disclose under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and, as such, is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the Agency's bargaining dispute, under the Authority's "covered by" test, a party is not required to bargain over terms and conditions of employment that have already been resolved by bargaining. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Serv., Social Security Admin., Baltimore, Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1017-18 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>)<span class="Italic">. </span>To assess whether a particular proposal is "covered by" the parties' agreement, the Authority applies a two-prong test. Under the first prong of the test, the Authority examines whether the subject matter in dispute is expressly contained in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Kansas City Serv. Ctr., Kansas City, Mo.</span>, 57 FLRA 126, 128-29 (2001). If the agreement provision does not expressly contain the matter, then the Authority will determine, under the second prong of the test, whether the matter is inseparably bound up with, and thus plainly an aspect of, a subject "covered by" the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that, under the parties' master agreement, only prong 1 of the Authority's test is applicable in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> Article 7, Section 1. The Agency does not dispute this assertion. Accordingly, all "covered by" claims advanced by the Agency in this case will be analyzed under that prong. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(ii)(2) (failure to respond to an assertion raised by the other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to that assertion); <span class="Italic">NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA at 441 (same); <span class="Italic">see also PASS</span>, 56 FLRA at 799 n.3; <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 374, 377 (1999) ("covered by" defense is subject to waiver).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the first prong of the "covered by" test, the question is whether Proposal 1 is expressly contained in Article 2 and Article 48 of the parties' master agreement. In this regard, Article 2 provides for Union representatives, and designees, for specified organizational levels at Agency facilities and official time for the representational activities of those representatives. Article 2, Section 21, also provides that the amounts of official time set forth in Article 2 cannot be increased or decreased unless agreed to by the parties at the national level. Because Proposal 1 arose out of bargaining at the national level, and concerns an amount of official time for EBUS representatives, even if such representatives fall within the ambit of Article 2--which the Union disputes--that provision does not excuse the Agency from bargaining over Proposal 1. As such, Proposal 1 cannot excuse the Agency from bargaining. <span class="Italic">See PASS</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>56 FLRA at 805 (definition of seniority not "covered by" agreement because provision of agreement "expressly permits" parties to bargain other definitions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Article 48, that provision: (1) concerns work groups relating to technological, procedural, or airspace changes that are formed by the Agency; and (2) specifies that Union representatives will participate in any such groups<span class="Italic"> </span>to provide "operational perspective." Article 48, Section 2. Proposal 1, by its terms, does not concern a work group. Rather, it relates to an individual Union representative who will serve as a resource person knowledgeable about the operation of EBUS and its effect on unit employees. That is, the proposal does not presuppose, and would operate without, the formulation of a work group by the Agency. Thus, Proposal 1 does not concern a matter that is expressly contained in Article 48.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NATCA</span> resolved as nonnegotiable under the "covered by" doctrine a proposal for refresher training for unit employees when a provision of the existing contract granted to the agency general authority to determine training needs and methods and provided specific means for employees to obtain remedial training, encompassing the subject matter of proposals governing restoration of proficiency through refresher training. 62 FLRA at 178-79 (Proposals 6 and 7). <span class="Italic">NATCA</span> added that if the only question as to a proposal is whether it is covered by a contract, the parties are to resolve that dispute through means other than a negotiability appeal. 62 FLRA at 183 (Proposal 13). <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1164 and SSA Dist. Office, New Bedford</span>, 54 FLRA 1327, 1335-36 (1998) (Proposal <span id="Page_457"></span>2) (dismissal without prejudice to union's right to file appeal if conditions governing review are met after a bargaining obligation issue involving the coverage of existing agreements was resolved). <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 61 FLRA 437 (2006), provides an example of a case determining both a negotiability dispute and resolving, against the agency the contention that the negotiability issue was covered by the existing contract.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's "covered by" doctrine, a party is not required to bargain over conditions of employment that already have been resolved by bargaining. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United Am.

To assess whether a particular proposal is "covered by" the parties' agreement, the Authority applies a two-prong test. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first prong of the "covered by" analysis, the Authority examines whether the subject matter is expressly contained in the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Authority does not require an exact congruence between the matter proposed for bargaining and the text of the agreement; if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute, then the matter is covered by the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 452 F.3d 793, 796 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The Authority has found that the subject matter of a proposal is expressly contained in a contract provision when the proposal would modify or conflict with the express terms of the contract provision. <span class="Italic">See NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 437, 441 (2006). Conversely, the Authority has found that the subject matter of a proposal is not expressly contained in a contract provision when the proposal would not modify or conflict with the express terms of the contract provision, "even if the proposals concerned the same general range of matters addressed in the provision[&#8197;]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 442.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the subject matter in dispute is not expressly contained in the agreement, then, under the second prong of the "covered by" analysis, the Authority determines whether the matter is "'inseparably bound up with, and...thus [is] plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the [agreement].'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 441 (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1018 (1993) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>)). That analysis considers the parties' intent and bargaining history. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Additionally, in order to satisfy the second prong, a matter must be more than tangentially related to a contract provision. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Nat'l Distrib. Ctr., Bloomington, Ill.</span>, 64 FLRA 586, 592 (2010) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). Rather, the party asserting the "covered by" argument must demonstrate that the subject matter of the proposal is so commonly considered to be an aspect of the matter set forth in the collective bargaining agreement that the negotiations that resulted in that provision are presumed to have foreclosed further bargaining over the matter. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018. <span class="Italic">See also IRS</span>, 64 FLRA at 592 (quoting <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 64 FLRA 199, 203 (2009)) (prong two met if matter is "so tied" to the contract provision that the negotiations are presumed to have foreclosed further bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first prong of the "covered by" test, Proposal 1 would require the Agency to distribute office machines so that all employees may equally access them, and would require the Agency to locate the office machines no farther than fifty feet from any employee's desk. Article 18-3(d) discusses employees' non-productive time; it does not discuss the distribution and location of office machines. In addition, the Agency does not claim, and the record does not indicate, that Proposal 1 would modify or conflict with Article 18-3(d). <span class="Italic">See NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA at 441. Accordingly, the subject matter of Proposal 1 is not expressly contained in Article 18-3(d). <span class="Italic">See D.C. Nurses</span>, 64 FLRA at 882. Thus, we find that Proposal 1 is not covered by Article 18-3(d) under prong one of the "covered by" test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second prong of the "covered by" test, the Agency does not cite bargaining history or any other evidence that indicates that the matters addressed in Proposal 1 are inseparably bound up with, and thus plainly an aspect of Article 18-3(d). Likewise, the Agency does not demonstrate that the location and distribution of office machines are so commonly considered to be an aspect of employees' non-productive time that it should be presumed that Article 18-3(d) foreclosed further bargaining over the location and distribution of those machines. As stated previously, the Agency has the burden of providing a record to support its assertion that a proposal is outside the duty to bargain under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA at 875. Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that Proposal 1 is covered by Article 18-3(d).</p>
<p class="noindent">The "covered by" defense defeated a negotiability appeal concerning an impact bargaining proposal over a workload distribution change when the parties' contract addressed workload management. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 70 FLRA 941 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216 and EEOC</span>, 71 FLRA 603 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting in part) (Proposal 3, a ground rules proposal concerning negotiators' travel costs, was not negotiable because the subject matter concerned the same subject matter as an article in the existing master agreement addressing official time, travel for negotiators).

<p class="noindent-1">Article 26, Section 3(A) states that "[t]he position description for each position will accurately reflect the actual duties, responsibilities, and the managerial relationships pertaining to the employee filling that position." Therefore, because the Agency already has a duty to maintain accurate position descriptions, the Agency argues that the subject matter of Proposal 3.b is covered by Article 26, Section 3(A). Here, the subject matter of Article 26, Section 3(A) demonstrates that the parties previously bargained over the accuracy of a BUE's position description. Specifically, Article 26, Section 3(A) requires the Agency to change a BUE's position description to reflect the actual duties of that BUE. Thus, the Agency has already negotiated how it will address situations where a BUE is assigned new duties--such as duties related to the Module--and we find that Proposal 3.b and Article 26, Section 3(A) concern the same subject matter.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In response, the Union asserts that "a proposal may restate existing obligations without affecting its negotiability." The Union argues that Proposal 3.b is within the duty to bargain because it merely restates the Agency's existing contractual obligations under Article 26, Section 3(A). However, in the cases cited by the Union, the Authority stated only that a proposal could restate existing <span class="Italic">statutory</span> obligations without imperiling its <span class="Italic">negotiability</span>.[41] Therefore, contrary to the Union's assertions, a proposal is outside the duty to bargain if it restates an existing contractual obligation that is expressly covered by the subject matter of an existing, negotiated contractual provision.[42] Moreover, the Union does not explain how Proposal 3.b addresses a subject matter that is not already covered by Article 26, Section 3(A) of the parties' agreement.[43] Consequently, we reject the Union's argument and find that the parties have already negotiated how the Agency will address the accuracy of a BUE's position description.[44] Therefore, Proposal 3.b is covered by the same subject matter as Article 26, Section 3(A) of the parties' agreement and the Agency has no duty to bargain over Proposal 3.b.</p>
