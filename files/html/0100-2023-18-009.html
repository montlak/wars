<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-13"><span class="space">a.</span> Direct Review</h5>
<p class="noindent">The circuit courts apply different tests to review of FLRA decisions resolving exceptions to arbitration awards that involve ULP issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many arbitration awards involve challenges to changes in management practices that allegedly were not been properly bargained--a ULP theory. Arbitrators may resolve the dispute and fashion a remedy. FLRA, with its <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review approach to issues of law arising in exceptions, then applies ULP law to the arbitration award. In the D.C. Circuit, the court will review the ensuing award if it is based on a ULP analysis rather than a contract analysis even if there is no explicit finding of a ULP. The court left open the possibility that if the contract contains a bargaining provision that parallels the statutory obligation, the contract alone, as the source of the arbitrator's award, might lead to a lack of jurisdiction of the court to review FLRA's decision on exceptions to that award (and D.C. Circuit decisions that follow in this section should be reviewed), <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 665 F.3d 1339, 1342-46 (D.C. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case turns on whether a government agency may provide employees with free bottled water even when safe and drinkable water is available from water fountains at their work sites.&#x2003;Under federal appropriations law, the answer is no.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the mid-1990s, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division in Newport, Rhode Island, began providing employees with bottled water. It did so after an EPA report indicated that water fountains in some Navy buildings in Newport contained components manufactured with lead. Beginning in 2005, however, the Navy replaced the problematic water fountains, tested the tap water, and determined it safe to drink. The Navy then stopped providing bottled water; it did not negotiate with employee unions before removing the bottled water. The Navy reasoned that an agency has no duty or authority to bargain over or grant benefits that are prohibited by federal appropriations law. And the Navy concluded that providing bottled water when safe and drinkable tap water was available would violate the legal prohibition against use of appropriated funds for employees' personal expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unions representing civilian employees at the Newport facilities objected to the removal of the bottled water and filed grievances with the Navy.&#x2003;When negotiations did not yield a compromise, the unions sought binding arbitration. An arbitrator sided with the unions and ordered the Navy to continue providing bottled water on the ground that bottled water had become a condition of employment. The Federal Labor Relations Authority--an independent government agency responsible for adjudicating federal labor-management disputes--affirmed the arbitrator's decision, holding that the Navy had a duty to bargain with the unions before removing the bottled water. The Navy petitioned for review in this Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division in Newport, Rhode Island, develops and supports submarine warfare systems for the U.S. Navy. Civilian employees at the Newport facilities are represented by two unions: (i) the National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-134, known as NAGE, and (ii) the Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers, Local R1-144, known as FUSE. NAGE negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Navy; FUSE had a grievance procedure agreement with the Navy, but no collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Navy began providing bottled water at the Newport facilities in the mid-1990s after it discovered that water fountains in some buildings were manufactured with components containing lead. Beginning in 2005, the Navy replaced those fountains with newer, lead-free models. The base command then re-tested the base's tap water sources. In 2006, after determining that the base's tap water was safe to drink, the Navy stopped providing bottled water. The base commander sent out a base-wide email assuring staff that the tap water was safe. The email informed base personnel that federal appropriations law precluded the Navy from providing bottled water given that safe and drinkable tap water was available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unions filed grievances under their negotiated dispute resolution procedures, arguing as relevant here that the Navy had a duty to bargain with them before removing the bottled water. When the grievances were not resolved through negotiation, the unions sought binding arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator found that any change in the practice of providing bottled water "required conferring and negotiating between the parties bound by the Collective Bargaining Agreement(s)." <span class="Italic">In re Arbitration Between Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Div. Newport &#x0026; FUSE/NAGE R1-144 &#x0026; NAGE R1-134</span>, FMCS Case No. 070330-55282-3, at 8 (June 19, 2008). The arbitrator declined to consider the Navy's argument that federal appropriations law barred it from providing bottled water. The arbitrator said that looking to federal appropriations law "would be looking outside of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Navy filed exceptions to the arbitration award with the Federal Labor Relations Authority.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). As relevant here, the Navy challenged the award on the grounds that (1) the arbitrator refused to consider its argument that federal appropriations law precluded it from providing bottled water, and (2) the arbitrator's findings drew no distinction between NAGE and FUSE, even though only NAGE had a collective bargaining agreement with the Navy. <span class="Italic">See Agency's Exceptions to Arbitrator Jerome H. Wolfson's June 19, 2008 Award &#x0026; Opinion </span>at 12, 15, 20, <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. Div. Newport, R.I.</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. 1136 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority denied the exceptions and affirmed the arbitrator's conclusion that the Navy was obligated to bargain before removing the bottled water. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. Div. Newport, R.I.</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. 1136, 1138-40 (2010). The Authority agreed with the arbitrator's determination that the Navy's "provision of bottled water for many years was an established past practice" at the Newport facilities and thus a "condition of employment," which the Navy could not change without bargaining with the unions. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1139. The Authority rejected the Navy's argument that federal appropriations law precluded the Navy from supplying bottled water, stating that "[n]one of the Comptroller General decisions...permits unilateral termination of a practice to provide bottled water." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Navy petitioned for review in this Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before reaching the merits of the Navy's arguments, we first consider whether we have jurisdiction to review the Authority's decision. To simplify the jurisdictional question: If the Authority's decision was based solely on the collective bargaining agreement between the Navy and NAGE, then we do not have jurisdiction. But if the Authority's decision was based on the Navy's statutory bargaining obligations, and not solely on the Navy's obligations under the collective bargaining agreement, then we do have jurisdiction. We conclude that the Authority's decision was based on the Navy's statutory bargaining obligations, not on the collective bargaining agreement. We therefore have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute establishes a two-track system for resolving labor disputes between federal agencies and government employee unions. <span class="Italic">See Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA (OEA)</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 62 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The first track permits a union alleging an unfair labor practice, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116, to file a charge with the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The General Counsel must investigate the charge and may commence an administrative proceeding against the agency if the charge has merit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(1)-(2). The Authority's resolution of a charge is subject to judicial review in the courts of appeals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second track--the track chosen by the unions in this case--is binding arbitration. Every collective bargaining agreement between an agency and a union must include a negotiated grievance procedure, and every grievance procedure must allow a party dissatisfied with the outcome of the grievance negotiations to opt for binding arbitration. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), (b)(1)(C)(iii). Once the arbitrator reaches a decision, either party may file exceptions to the arbitrator's award with the Federal Labor Relations Authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). The Authority reviews the arbitration award to ensure that it is not "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation," or otherwise deficient on any ground "similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An aggrieved party may elect either track--the statutory complaint procedure or binding arbitration--but not both. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the aggrieved party chooses the second track, the Authority's order resolving the exceptions to the arbitration award is ordinarily not judicially reviewable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1). Insulating arbitration awards from judicial review reflects "a strong Congressional policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes" and furthers "Congress's interest in providing arbitration results substantial finality." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, N.Y. State Council v. FLRA</span>, 507 F.3d 697, 699 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, a narrow exception exists. Section 7123(a) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Any person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority <span class="Italic">other than </span>an order under--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;section 7122 of this title (involving an award by an arbitrator), <span class="Italic">unless the order involves an unfair labor practice </span>under section 711[6][2] of this title, or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate unit determination),</p>
<p class="noindent-1">may, during the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the order was issued, institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the United States court of appeals in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, under Section 7123(a), an FLRA order reviewing an arbitration award is subject to judicial review if it "involves an unfair labor practice" under Section 7116[3].</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The statutory text refers to "section 7118." That reference "has been recognized to be an error; the correct reference is to section 7116." <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 63 n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Refusing "to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization" constitutes a statutory "unfair labor practice" under Section 7116(a)(5). The statutory unfair labor practice at issue here is the Navy's refusal to negotiate over a change to a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority argues that its decision in this case is not subject to judicial review--hat is, that the decision did not "involve" a statutory unfair labor practice--because the Authority's opinion does not explicitly discuss a statutory "unfair labor practice." That argument contravenes this Court's precedents. We have not interpreted Section 7123(a)(1) to depend on whether the Authority explicitly discussed a specific statutory unfair labor practice. Instead, "the standard is that a statutory unfair labor practice must be either an explicit ground for, <span class="Italic">or be necessarily implicated by</span>, the Authority's decision." <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 67-68 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Where a successful claim <span class="Italic">could not possibly </span>have been upheld based on the contract because the contract provided no ground for the Authority's decision, the Authority's decision necessarily implicates a statutory unfair labor practice. That is what happened here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For several reasons, it is apparent that the Authority derived the Navy's duty to bargain over the removal of bottled water--that is, to bargain over a change to a condition of employment--from the statute, not from the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">First</span>, the Authority did not identify any provision of the collective bargaining agreement as creating a duty to bargain over the manner in which the Navy provided safe drinking water. Neither did the arbitrator. Our decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA (NTEU)</span>, the companion case to <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association,</span> provides a useful comparison. <span class="Italic">See </span>824 F.2d at 68. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the union argued that the Customs Service had breached its "duty to bargain" by "failing to negotiate with respect to the changes in overtime practices." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The union grounded its claim on its collective bargaining agreement, which provided that "the Union has the right to bargain over the procedures which the Employer will observe in exercising its management rights authority." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Because the union "affirmatively chose to invoke the agreement, not the statute," the Court found that it did not have jurisdiction under Section 7123(a)(1), even though "the contractual provision at issue mirrors the Act." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 69.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, by contrast, there is no contractual provision that "mirrors," or even approximates, the statutory duty "to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5). The only relevant provision of the NAGE Collective Bargaining Agreement is article 25, section 6. That section requires the Navy to provide "high quality drinking and wash water facilities" but says nothing about bargaining over the manner in which the Navy fulfills that obligation--that is, by water fountains or bottled water.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Second</span>, the Authority's discussion of the "duty to bargain" over changed conditions of employment relies on its own case law discussing statutory unfair labor practices, not contractual grievances. The Authority's order cites its prior decisions in <span class="Italic">DOL I </span>and <span class="Italic">DOL II, see </span>64 F.L.R.A. at 1139, where it held that the Department of Labor committed a statutory unfair labor practice by failing to bargain over the removal of water coolers. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Labor (DOL I),</span> 37 F.L.R.A. 25, 36 (1990) ("[W]e conclude that DOL...<span class="Italic">violated section 7116(1) and (5) of the Statute </span>when they decided to remove and/or stop paying for the water coolers without giving the Union notice and an opportunity to bargain over the decision to do so.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Labor (DOL II)</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 899, 910 (1990) ("The Respondent Violated Section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute"). The Authority's reliance on its statutory unfair labor practice case law further demonstrates that it derived the Navy's duty to bargain over the bottled water from the statute, not from any contractual provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Third</span>, of the two unions that brought the initial grievances, only one--NAGE--even had a collective bargaining agreement with the Navy. The other--FUSE--had negotiated a grievance procedure agreement (which it invoked in this case) but no collective bargaining agreement. With respect to FUSE, the Authority's contention that the claim "was litigated solely as a contractual violation" is thus illogical. There simply was no contract on which the "duty to bargain" with FUSE could have been predicated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision necessarily involved a statutory unfair labor practice. Therefore, this Court has jurisdiction under Section 7123(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. and NAGE Local R1-134</span>, 64 FLRA 1136, 1137 (2010), the predicate for the 2012 D.C. Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy,</span> summarized the arbitrator's award that found a bargaining failure:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the merits of the grievances, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's practice of providing bottled water was grounded in Article 25, Section 6 of the NAGE agreement, and that, by expanding the practice to buildings with lead-free drinking fountains, the parties effected "a modification to the actual written contract." The Arbitrator also found that the Agency was required to bargain before changing this established past practice. He rejected the Agency's reliance on federal fiscal laws and decisions of the United States Comptroller General, finding that he should not "look[&#8197;] outside of the [c]ollective [b]argaining [a]greement between the parties." The Arbitrator directed the Agency to resume providing bottled water at no charge to the employees in the buildings where it previously had done so.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 2012 <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy</span> decision distinguished <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 62-72 (D.C. Cir. 1987), considering the question of when an FLRA decision reviewing an arbitration award involves a ULP practice. In <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, the court stated that for the right of judicial review to attach to an FLRA decision reviewing exceptions to an arbitration award involving a ULP, "conduct must actually be so characterized and the claim pursued, by whatever route, as a statutory unfair labor practice, not as something else":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These two cases present similar issues concerning the scope of federal court jurisdiction over decisions by the Federal Labor Relations Authority reviewing arbitral awards pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.&#x2003;In both cases, the FLRA moved to dismiss the petition for review on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1) (1982). Applying a jurisdictional analysis previously embraced by our colleagues in the Second, Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, we conclude that jurisdiction lies in only one of the two cases. Specifically, we lack jurisdiction in No. 85-1753, concerning the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU); however, jurisdiction does lie in No. 85-1420, concerning the Overseas Education Association (OEA). These conclusions render it necessary to reach the merits only in OEA, as to which we are persuaded, for reasons set forth in the latter part of this opinion, that the case should be remanded to the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both petitions center around the scope of the judicial review provision of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (1982 &#x0026; Supp. III 1985). The Statute establishes essentially a two-track system for resolving labor disputes. Under the first route, a party subjected to an unfair labor practice, as defined in section 7116, can file a charge with the Authority's General Counsel, who must investigate and determine whether a complaint should issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a).[1] If a complaint is issued, then the matter is adjudicated by the FLRA. Its ensuing decision is, in turn, subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7123.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;A decision by the General Counsel not to issue a complaint pursuant to section 7118(a)(1) is not subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">See Turgeon v. FLRA,</span> 677 F.2d 937 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second route involves the collective bargaining agreement.&#x2003;Section 7121 of the statute directs that such agreements include grievance procedures. The Act further mandates that any dispute not satisfactorily resolved through the negotiated grievance procedure is subject to binding arbitration, which may be invoked by either party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(3)(C). The arbitrator's decision can then be reviewed by the FLRA pursuant to section 7122. Importantly, judicial review of the FLRA's determination in such cases is generally foreclosed by section 7123. That section provides for judicial review only for orders other than those under "section 7122 of this title (involving an award by an arbitrator), <span class="Italic">unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 711[6]</span> <span class="Italic"> of this title.</span>" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a).[2] In other words, the statute as a general matter removes FLRA decisions reviewing arbitral awards from judicial review, but carves out an exception of decisive relevance to the cases at hand--arbitral decisions are to be subjected to judicial scrutiny <span class="Italic">only</span> when the FLRA's order "involves an unfair labor practice under section 711[6] of this title." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The statute actually refers to section 7118, not section 7116. The reference to section 7118, however, has been recognized to be an error; the correct reference is to section 7116. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1923 v. FLRA,</span> 675 F.2d 612, 613 n.2 (4th Cir. 1982). Section 7123(a) reads in its entirety as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3"><span id="page_2517"></span>(a)&#x2003;Any person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority other than an order under--</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(1) section 7122 of this title (involving an award of an arbitrator), unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 7118 of this title, or</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(2) section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate unit determination),</p>
<p class="noindent-3">may, during the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the order was issued, institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the United States court of appeals in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rationale for circumscribed judicial review of such cases is not hard to divine.&#x2003;It is firmly grounded in the strong Congressional policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes and accordingly granting arbitration results substantial finality. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7122 (FLRA review of arbitration awards is limited; in absence of exception, arbitral award "shall be final and binding"). The pertinent legislative history indicates that "[i]n light of the limited nature of the Authority's review," Congress found it "inappropriate for there to be subsequent review by the court of appeals in such matters." H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2860.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this dual system, some labor disputes are capable of following either track; a particular action may be capable of characterization as either a statutory unfair labor practice or a violation of the collective bargaining agreement. That is, while an aggrieved party could often invoke the statutory process of the grievance process by alleging a <span class="Italic">statutory</span> unfair labor practice,[3] the party could choose to characterize the same conduct as a violation of the collective bargaining agreement and invoke the grievance procedures on that ground. This type of situation will present itself, for example, when the collective bargaining agreement mirrors the statutory provisions, as the agreement in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> does. Congress recognized this dual possibility and left the route selection to the discretion of the aggrieved party, while at the same time mandating that selection of one route precluded use of the other. To this end, section 7116(d) directs that "issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under [section 7116], but not under both procedures." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The statutory process would always be available to address an alleged statutory unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7118. As noted above, the grievance process may also be available to address statutory unfair labor practices because the collective bargaining agreement permits such matters to be grieved. For example, the collective bargaining agreement in OEA is highly general with respect to what issues may be raised in a grievance procedure. The applicable provision permits "any matter of concern or dissatisfaction to a teacher or group of teachers within the recognized unit" to be grieved, with certain exceptions not relevant here. This provision is certainly broad enough to permit an aggrieved party to invoke the grievance procedures by alleging a statutory unfair labor practice. The situation referred to in text is somewhat different, involving underlying conduct that could be characterized as a statutory unfair labor practice, but is instead grieved as a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both routes offer one level of review--the statutory route provides for judicial review of the FLRA's decision and the grievance route provides for FLRA review of the arbitrator's decision. The difference between the two routes--and the central issue in both of the cases before us--is that the grievance route precludes judicial review, unless, again, the Authority's order "involves an unfair labor practice under section 711[6]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1). It is clear that if a dual-natured type of complaint were pursued as a <span class="Italic">statutory</span> unfair labor practice, any FLRA order would be subject to judicial review under section 7123(a)(1), even if the aggrieved party chose to utilize the grievance/arbitration route. The precise issue presented by these two cases is whether a complaint with this potential dual nature which is pursued along the grievance/arbitration route <span class="Italic">as a violation of the collective bargaining agreement,</span> not the statute, is nonetheless subject to judicial review because, in the words of section 7123(a)(1), it "involves an unfair labor practice under section 711."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our interpretive task begins, as always, with the language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Hohri,</span> __ U.S. __, __, 107 S. Ct. 2246, 2250, 96 L. Ed.2d 51 (1987); <span class="Italic">Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth,</span> 471 U.S. 681, 685, 105 S. Ct. 2297, 2301-02, 85 L. Ed.2d 692 (1985); <span class="Italic">American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson,</span> 456 U.S. 63, 68, 102 S. Ct. 1534, 1537, 71 L. Ed.2d 748 (1982); <span class="Italic">Consumer Products Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</span> 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980); <span class="Italic">Vanguard Interstate Tours, Inc. v. ICC,</span> 735 F.2d 591, 597 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (quoting <span class="Italic">GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</span> 447 U.S. at 108, 100 S. Ct. at 2056); <span class="Italic">Symons v. Chrysler Corp. Loan Guarantee Bd.,</span> 670 F.2d 238, 241 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Section 7123(a)(1) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Any person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority other than an order under--</p>
<p class="noindent-3"><span id="page_2518"></span>(1)&#x2003;section 7122 of this title (involving an award of an arbitrator), unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 711[6] of this title,</p>
<p class="noindent-3">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">may...institute an action for judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The effect of this provision, as we explained above, is to make FLRA decisions reviewing arbitral awards judicially reviewable only if they "involve" a statutory unfair labor practice. Two features of the statutory language bear emphasis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, section 7123(a)(1) identifies precisely what type of unfair labor practices confer jurisdiction on the federal courts. The FLRA order must deal with an unfair labor practice "under" the Act, or more precisely, "under" section 7116. Indeed, it seems somewhat anomalous to have "unfair labor practices" under anything other than the Act. "Unfair labor practice" is, after all, a statutory term of art; what constitutes an "unfair labor practice" is established by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a), (b). Nonetheless, the unions in the two cases before us argue, to varying degrees, that "unfair labor practices" do in fact exist outside the statute. In essence, they contend that their collective bargaining agreements have incorporated the statutory unfair labor practices, such that "unfair labor practice" has taken on a more generic meaning, outside its statutory origins. We need not consider whether the term "unfair labor practice," standing alone, could ever contemplate something other than an unfair labor practice as defined in subsections (a) and (b) of section 7116. For in the situation before us, Congress has removed any cause for doubt on such a point by including within section 7123(a)(1) a highly specific cross reference to a provision of the Act, expressly contemplating only the unfair labor practices therein defined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the precision Congress employed in pinpointing exactly which of a potentially broad class of "unfair labor practices" suffice to confer federal court jurisdiction is counterbalanced by Congress' relative generality in selecting the word "involves" as the operative standard. Courts, it has repeatedly been held, should assume that Congress intends the words it employs to have their ordinary meaning. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Escondido Mutual Water Co. v. La Jolla Band of Mission Indians,</span> 466 U.S. 765, 772, 104 S. Ct. 2105, 2110, 80 L. Ed.2d 753 (1984); <span class="Italic">American Tobacco Co.,</span> 456 U.S. at 68, 102 S. Ct. at 1537; <span class="Italic">Addison v. Holly Hill Co.,</span> 322 U.S. 607, 618, 64 S. Ct. 1215, 1221, 88 L. Ed. 1488 (1944) (Frankfurter, J.); <span class="Italic">Inner City Broadcasting Corp. v. Sanders,</span> 733 F.2d 154, 158 (D.C. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Railroad Yardmasters of America v. Harris,</span> 721 F.2d 1332, 1341 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The ordinary meaning of "involves" is not difficult to divine; the trusty dictionary informs us that it means "to have within or as a part of itself." Websters' Third New International Dictionary 1191 (unabridged ed. 1981). The language of the statute therefore suggests that the statutory unfair labor practice need not be the <span class="Italic">central focus</span> or at the core of the FLRA's order, nor even an expressly articulated ground for the FLRA's decision. What the statute requires, more modestly, is that a statutory unfair labor practice be discussed in some way in, or be some part of, the Authority's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, while the type of unfair labor practice appears to be limited to a narrow, exact class--statutory unfair labor practices--the extent to which that unfair labor practice must be featured in the Authority's determination is less certain. An FLRA holding that there was (or was not) a statutory unfair labor practice committed in a particular case would obviously satisfy this somewhat amorphous standard, but something short of a paradigm case may also sufficiently "involve" a statutory unfair labor practice to confer jurisdiction. In sum, the statutory language is clear and unambiguous with respect to exactly what must be at issue before an FLRA decision reviewing an arbitral award is in turn subject to judicial review--it must be a <span class="Italic">statutory</span> unfair labor practice. The statute is far less clear on how broadly "involves" should be construed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Passing from the language of the statute to its legislative history, there is nothing that contradicts the clarity with which section 7123(a)(1) speaks with respect to which type of unfair labor practice it contemplates, <span class="Italic">cf. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</span> 447 U.S. at 108, 100 S. Ct. at 2056, and virtually nothing that bears on the scope of the term "involves." Indeed, the only relevant portion of the legislative history are indications (alluded to earlier) that Congress favored arbitration and accorded arbitration results substantial finality. It was with this policy in mind that Congress severely circumscribed judicial review of FLRA decisions involving arbitral awards. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2860.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, after considering the "traditional tools of statutory construction," <span class="Italic">Chevron, USA v. NRDC,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-82 n.9, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), we find Congress' intent on "the precise question at issue," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 842, 104 S. Ct. at 2781, to be considerably less than clear and unambiguous. <span class="Italic">See also INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</span> __ U.S. __, 107 S. Ct. 1207, 94 L. Ed.2d 434 (1987). What does seem clear is that Congress required that a statutory unfair labor practice actually be implicated to <span id="page_2519"></span>some extent in the Authority's order. While the precise extent is unclear, the legislative record strongly suggests that the mere fact that conduct is <span class="Italic">capable</span> of characterization as a statutory unfair practice is insufficient to satisfy the strictures of section 7123(a)(1); the conduct must actually be so characterized and the claim pursued, by whatever route, as a statutory unfair labor practice, not as something else.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Any other reading would fly in the face of the proarbitration policy Congress articulated in passing the Act.&#x2003;An interpretation that permitted judicial review of any labor dispute in which the underlying conduct could be characterized as a statutory unfair labor practice drastically limits the finality which Congress intended to attach to arbitral awards. Moreover, such a reading precludes a union or other aggrieved party from electing to pursue and resolve the dispute along the grievance track as a violation of the collective bargaining agreement. A party may well choose to do so knowing full well that it could have opted for a statutory unfair labor practice route, but preferring to benefit from the relatively expeditious and (presumably) final result that arbitration promised. In short, a broader reading of section 7123(a)(1) cannot be reconciled with one of the core purposes of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fortunately, while the precise issue posed by these two cases has not been previously addressed in this circuit, we do not write on a blank slate. The caselaw treating this issue is somewhat sparse, but the Second, Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have previously considered the question and developed an interpretation in accord with that adumbrated above and solidly grounded in the statute's language and history. In addition to buttressing our proposed reading of the statute, these cases offer guidance with respect to the parameters of the key word, "involves." Accordingly, we turn to an examination of these cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first court to address the issue was the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923 v. FLRA,</span> 675 F.2d 612 (4th Cir. 1982). In that case, the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the agency, the Social Security Administration, provided that the parties would negotiate over any modifications to the performance appraisal system. The agency, however, informed the union that it "intended to establish performance standards...and that these actions would not be negotiable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 613. The union invoked the grievance procedures and, eventually, sought arbitration. The arbitrator ruled in the union's favor, but the Authority reversed. Faced with this adverse ruling from the Authority, the union sought judicial review. The court found that while the dispute between the union and Social Security could have been litigated in the context of a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) [the statutory unfair labor practices provision concerning refusal to negotiate], the fact is that the union invoked the grievance procedure and arbitration on an entirely different theory. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court recognized that the underlying conduct was clearly capable of being characterized as a statutory unfair labor practice, but that no such theory had actually been considered or addressed by the Authority. Under those circumstances, the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Ninth Circuit next spoke on the issue.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">United States Marshals Service v. FLRA,</span> 708 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1983), the court, offering the most extensive analysis of the issue to date, faced a situation in which an aggrieved party had chosen to characterize as a violation of the collective bargaining agreement conduct that could have been characterized as a statutory unfair labor practice. The aggrieved party, accordingly, pursued the grievance/arbitration route, but in the wake of an adverse decision by the FLRA, sought judicial review. The Ninth Circuit held that it was without jurisdiction, a conclusion it specifically described as "in accord" with the Fourth Circuit's opinion in <span class="Italic">AFGE. Id.</span> at 1420. Significantly, the <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he proper rule is this: where arbitration has been elected and the Authority reviews exceptions to an award, we have no jurisdiction to review the Authority's determinations <span class="Italic">unless an unfair labor practice is either explicit or a necessary ground for the final order issued by the Authority.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the court expressly refused to transform what had theretofore been pursued as a contractual dispute into a statutory unfair labor practice proceeding and thereby confer federal court jurisdiction. Indeed, the <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> court offered as its primary rationale for this refusal the familiar factor of Congress' pro-arbitration policy. The court also opined that judicial review would be appropriate where "an unfair labor practice is <span class="Italic">necessarily implicated.</span>" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The primary rationale offered by the Ninth Circuit for its refusal to recharacterize the type of claim involved was Congress' general pro-arbitration policy. For example, the court concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To say that we have jurisdiction whenever a contract dispute can also fit within the unfair labor practice sections of the Act, though it has not been so treated either by the arbitrator or the Authority, would be to give too little scope and effect to the arbitration process and to the final review function of the Authority, procedures deemed important to the expeditious review that Congress made a central part of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> is substantially, if not identically, in line with what seems to us the more plausible interpretation of section 7123(a)(1), namely, that a statutory unfair labor practice is an unvarying requirement. The fact that the underlying conduct could be characterized as a statutory unfair labor practice will not suffice. What is more, the <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> opinion offers helpful guidance in discerning when a case "involves" a statutory unfair labor practice; the standard is that a statutory unfair labor practice[7] must be either an explicit ground for, or be necessarily implicated by, the Authority's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Marshals Service </span>uses the more generic phrase, "unfair labor practice," failing to add the more precise qualifying word, "statutory." But nonetheless, <span class="Italic">Marshals Service </span>should be read as contemplating only statutory unfair labor practices. A contrary reading would ignore the factual situation facing the <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> court. As the court there recounted,</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[t]he question presented by the statute, and on this appeal, is whether, when the arbitration path is chosen and a contract violation is the focus of the arbitration, we nevertheless may review the Authority's disposition of exceptions to the award if the underlying contract violation can be characterized as an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">708 F.2d at 1420. The <span class="Italic">Marshals Service </span>court answered no, clearly accepting--as it was required to do given the clarity of the statute in this respect--that a statutory unfair labor practice was required for federal court jurisdiction. The exact same conduct wrapped in a contractual package would not do. <span class="Italic">See also id.</span> (a court does not have jurisdiction "whenever a contract dispute can also fit within the unfair labor practice sections of the Act ").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> test was subsequently accepted first by the Eleventh Circuit, <span class="Italic">Tonetti v. FLRA,</span> 776 F.2d 929 (11th Cir. 1985), and then by the Second Circuit. <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA,</span> 792 F.2d 25 (2d Cir. 1986). In our view, <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> and the decisions following its lead are solidly grounded in the statute's language and history. We would be ill-advised to depart from this accumulated wisdom of the circuits, which we shall now seek to apply to the facts at hand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> involves a decision concerning overtime practices. Specifically, the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Customs Service Office in Baltimore determined to restructure the practices of the Customs Patrol Officers in his command with respect to overtime. Previously, the Patrol Officers had devoted significant time to investigative work. This system led to a high number of hours being compensated at a premium rate as administratively uncontrollable overtime. To reduce this high incidence of overtime, the SAC assigned investigative work to other employees, relegating the Patrol Officers to duties that could be performed without overtime. The SAC effected these changes, however, without notifying NTEU, the Patrol Officers' collective bargaining agent, and without negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dismayed by the SAC's unilateral action, NTEU filed a grievance alleging a violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, the union invoked article 37, section 1(b) of the agreement, which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Employer recognizes that the Union has the right to bargain over the procedures which the Employer will observe in exercising its management rights authority, and/or over appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of the Employer's management rights authorities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">In re U.S. Customs Service,</span> No. 83K/27177, slip op. at 5 (Arbitrator's Decision and Award May 11, 1984) (quoting Collective Bargaining Agreement, article 37, &#x00A7; 1(b)), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> No. 85-1753 Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 8. The union contended that by failing to negotiate with respect to the changes in overtime practices, the Customs Service had violated this "duty to bargain."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance eventually found its way to arbitration.&#x2003;After a one-day hearing, the arbitrator issued his decision in May 1984. The arbitrator held that the Customs Service had indeed violated the collective bargaining agreement; in the arbitrator's interpretation, the agreement required that negotiations precede any such change. Accordingly, the arbitrator ordered the Customs Service to bargain and awarded the affected Patrol Officers back pay to compensate for the amount of premium pay they would have received. Throughout the decision, the arbitrator addressed only the collective bargaining agreement, without even a citation or reference to (much less a discussion of) any provision of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Customs Service thereupon filed exceptions with the FLRA, contending primarily that no duty to bargain existed under the agreement and that the award of back pay was contrary to law. The Authority did not disturb the duty-to-bargain ruling, but found the arbitrator's back-pay<span id="page_2520"></span> award contrary to law, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(2) (statutory provision authorizing premium pay). The FLRA thus set aside that portion of the arbitral award. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) (authorizing Authority to take remedial action if an arbitral award is "contrary to any law"). As was true with the arbitrator, the Authority did not address the failure to negotiate as a statutory unfair labor practice; indeed, the Authority did not even address the existence of a duty to bargain because it found the agency's exceptions to that aspect of the arbitral award to be "nothing more than a disagreement" with the arbitrator's conclusions and therefore an insufficient basis to disturb the award. <span class="Italic">See generally United States Customs Service, Northeast Region,</span> 20 F.L.R.A. 190 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU then filed a petition in this court seeking review of the Authority's decision. The union argues essentially that jurisdiction lies under section 7123(a)(1) because the underlying agency conduct could have been characterized as a statutory unfair labor practice and because the contractual provision at issue mirrors the Act. But an obvious difficulty looms for NTEU's position; its situation is virtually identical to that in <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> itself. Although the underlying conduct was indeed capable of characterization as a statutory unfair labor practice, particularly by virtue of the fact that the agreement tracks the Act, it is clear beyond cavil that it <span class="Italic">was</span> not so characterized by any party, the arbitrator, or the Authority. It is simply not for this court to try to determine whether "a contract dispute can also fit within the unfair labor practice sections of the Act," <span class="Italic">Marshals Service,</span> 708 F.2d at 1420, and thereby confer jurisdiction upon ourselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the agreement mirrors the statute does nothing to change this result.&#x2003;The way in which a contractual provision is interpreted and applied, it seems to us, may well differ from the manner in which similar (or identical) language in a statute may be interpreted and applied. But in any event, the hard and simple truth, clear from the face of the statute, is that the Authority's order must "involve" a statutory unfair labor practice. The fact that the agreement is similar or even identical to the statute cannot alter the fact that it is not a statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the union affirmatively chose to invoke the agreement, not the statute. It must now live with the consequences that flow from invocation of this theory. NTEU cannot be permitted at this late stage to transform its grievance claim into a statutory claim. Accordingly, as to NTEU, the FLRA's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is well-founded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next case presents quite a different kettle of fish.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">OEA</span> involves the attempted dismissal from the federal service of a teacher who was deeply involved in union activities. William Schussel is an employee of the Department of Defense Dependents' Schools (DODDS). In 1979, he was assigned to teach industrial arts at Yokota High School in Japan. While teaching at Yokota, Schussel also served as the Pacific Area Director for the Overseas Education Association, a teachers' union. His duties in the latter capacity resulted in frequent absences from school, which in turn caused the principal difficulties in scheduling classes. Eventually, on November 27, 1981, the principal proposed to a DODDS regional office that Schussel's teaching position be eliminated. The stated justification for the proposal was an asserted low level of enrollment in Schussel's industrial arts classes. In December 1981, the principal notified Schussel that his teaching position would be eliminated at the end of the 1981-1982 school year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This action led OEA to file a statutory unfair labor practice charge with the FLRA.&#x2003;Specifically, OEA alleged violations of subsection (1) and (2) of section 7116(a). After being advised on March 9, 1982 by the FLRA Regional Office that there appeared to be insufficient evidence, OEA voluntarily withdrew the charge. On March 19, 1982, Schussel was sent "an advance notice of separation by reduction-in-force." Notice of Reduction-in-Force (Mar. 19, 1982), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> No. 85-1420 J.A. at 103. Schussel responded by filing a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement between DODDS and OEA, complaining about his "improper dismissal from the Federal Service."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This grievance proceeded through the dispute-resolution process and ultimately resulted in arbitration. Hearings were held before an arbitrator on March 24-25, 1983, and on June 8, 1983, the arbitrator issued his decision and award. The arbitrator first rejected DODDS' argument that the earlier, withdrawn unfair labor practice charge precluded Schussel from filing a grievance. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d) (issues that can be raised as either a grievance or statutory unfair labor practice cannot be raised "under both procedures"). On the merits, the arbitrator ruled in Schussel's favor, concluding that the attempt to terminate his position was motivated by Schussel's union activities (primarily the absences that those activities required). Accordingly, the arbitrator ordered that Schussel be reinstated to his position at Yokota High School, receive back pay, and otherwise be "made whole."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DODDS filed exceptions to the arbitrator's decision with the Authority, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a), and in May 1985, the FLRA set aside the arbitral award. <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Pacific Region,</span> 17 F.L.R.A. 1001 (1985), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> No. 85-1420 J.A. at 1. The basis for the FLRA's decision was that the dispute was precluded from being raised as a grievance by section 7116(d), which "effectively provides that when in the discretion of the aggrieved party, an issue has been raised under the unfair labor practice procedures, the issue subsequently may not be raised as a grievance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1002; <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d). To reach this conclusion, the Authority was required to decide whether "the issue which was the subject matter of the unfair labor practice charge is the same as that which is the subject matter of the grievance." 17 F.L.R.A. at 1003. In doing so, the Authority considered exactly what provisions Schussel's unfair labor practice charge alleged had been violated. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (2)). After assessing the nature of the unfair labor practice charge, the Authority expressly concluded "that the issue raised both by the charge and the grievance was the same."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The precise issue before us is whether the FLRA's decision "involves" a statutory unfair labor practice by virtue of (1) its discussion of a statutory unfair labor practice and (2) its holding that the arbitration is precluded by the filing of a previous statutory unfair labor practice charge. In our view, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">OEA</span> "necessarily implicates" a statutory unfair labor practice, within the meaning of Judge Kennedy's opinion for the court in <span class="Italic">Marshals Service,</span> 708 F.2d at 1420.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There obviously can be no dispute that the Authority's decision expressly referred to a statutory unfair labor practice. But this reference was no mere citation in passing to the unfair labor practice provision, section 7116(a). To the contrary, the Authority was required to make a detailed assessment of the precise nature of a statutory unfair labor practice charge, and then to compare the substance of that charge with the substance of the grievance before the arbitrator. After doing so, the Authority expressly concluded that the two were identical. Indeed, the FLRA was obliged so to conclude in order to decide that the arbitrator's award was contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d); <span class="Italic">cf. id</span>. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) (Authority may set aside an arbitral award that is "contrary to any law"). This sort of substantive evaluation of a statutory unfair labor practice abundantly suffices to satisfy the relatively imprecise "involves" standard of section 7123(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Perhaps recognizing this, the Authority argues for tightening up the standard. Specifically, the Authority contends that section 7123(a)(1) requires that the FLRA decision address "on the merits" a statutory unfair labor practice, and that its consideration of the statutory unfair labor practice in OEA does not satisfy this "on the merits" test. But this reading is inconsistent with the express language of section 7123(a)(1). The section will simply not bear the restrictive reading championed by the FLRA. To the contrary, a rather general term, "involves," was employed by Congress. As discussed above, this strongly suggests that something less than treatment "on the merits" is required. Moreover, the <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> line of cases has enunciated a test--namely, the statutory unfair labor practice must be either an explicit ground for or be necessarily implicated by the Authority's decision--that is flatly contrary to the interpretation urged by the FLRA. "Necessarily implicated" is obviously not the same as "on the merits." Agreeing with our sister circuits that have interpreted "involves" as meaning "involves" (not "address on the merits"), we apply the <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> test and conclude that the FLRA's decision "necessarily implicates" a statutory unfair labor practice. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction under section 7123(a)(1) to review the Authority's determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the merits of <span class="Italic">OEA,</span> petitioner argues that a remand is necessary. We agree. Without addressing several of the arguments raised by petitioner, we accept the contention that the unfair labor practice charge and the grievance did not involve the same issue, and that the Authority's dispositive conclusion to the contrary was in error. Here are the reasons for our conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator found that there were different factual predicates for the unfair labor practice charge and the grievance; he further determined that the two presented different issues. Particularly in light of the limited scope of the FLRA's review of arbitral awards, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122, it was error for the Authority to override the arbitrator's determination and come to the opposite conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unfair labor practice charge was filed in December 1981.&#x2003;It alleged that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">DODDS management is actively proceeding to eliminate the...Industrial Arts position at Yokota High School while the employee assigned to the position, Mr. Will Schussel, is acting "in the capacity of a representative for a labor organization."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance, in contrast, was filed in March 1982, after Schussel had received a notice of reduction in force, informing him that he would be dismissed. Accordingly, his grievance complained of "improper dismissal from the Federal Service." Thus, the situation facing Schussel, and the corresponding actions being taken against him, were quite different when he filed the grievance than was the case when the unfair labor practice charge was filed. Whereas in late 1981 the agency was only eliminating a particular position at one high school in the vast DODDS <span id="page_2521"></span>system, by early 1982 the employee was facing the prospect of outright termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the grievance presented an alleged violation of the collective bargaining agreement, while the unfair labor practice charge concerned a statutory violation. It would be strange indeed, in light of <span class="Italic">Marshals Service</span> and the cases following in its wake, to contend that the two present the identical issue. Since the issue in the two proceedings was not the same (either in terms of the factual predicate or the legal framework), section 7116 (d) never came into play. The Authority's invocation of that provision was therefore in error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we remand OEA to the FLRA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">Judicial review of FLRA's decision on exceptions to an award was available when FLRA's decision directly determined a ULP issue in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 754 F.3d 1031 (D.C. Cir. 2014). But the D.C. Circuit eschewed jurisdiction to review an FLRA decision affirming an arbitration award when FLRA's decision did not directly find or resolve a ULP, but instead affirmed a contractual basis for the arbitrator's award, <span class="Italic">Broadcasting Bd. of Gov. v. FLRA</span>, 752 F.3d 453, 456-59 (D.C. Cir. 2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lying at the heart of this case is a fundamental principle of federal labor relations law: arbitration awards are presumed final and not subject to judicial review. Reflecting this principle, the Statute prohibits courts from reviewing an FLRA order "involving an award by an arbitrator, unless the order involves an unfair labor practice." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). "Insulating arbitration awards from judicial review reflects a strong Congressional policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes and furthers Congress's interest in providing arbitration results substantial finality." <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 665 F.3d at 1344 (internal quotation marks omitted). The "limited exception that allows...judicial review...furthers Congress's other stated interest of ensuring a single, uniform body of case law concerning unfair labor practices." <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 507 F.3d at 699 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, for this Court to have subject matter jurisdiction over the Board's petition, the order under review must "involve[&#8197;]" a statutory unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The word "involves" is far from precise. Simplifying our task, this Court has addressed the word's scope in a series of decisions, all of which faithfully respect Congress's desire to limit judicial review of arbitration awards. We first considered the meaning of "involves" in <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61 (D.C. Cir. 1987), in which we held that "a statutory unfair labor practice [must] actually be implicated to some extent in the [FLRA's] order," so even if certain conduct is "<span class="Italic">capable</span> of characterization as a statutory unfair practice...[,] the conduct must actually be so characterized and the claim pursued, by whatever route, as a statutory unfair labor practice, not as something else." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 66. Not only that, but in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2510 v. FLRA</span>, 453 F.3d 500 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>), we emphasized that even when an aggrieved party argues that the other party committed a statutory unfair labor practice, and even when the arbitrator's award addresses that alleged unfair labor practice, "it is the order of the [FLRA] that is the subject of the petition for judicial review," not the arbitrator's decision or the initial grievance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 504. That order, moreover, must do more than merely acknowledge an unfair labor practice. As we made clear in <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 179 (D.C. Cir. 1994), a "passing reference does not satisfy the requirement that an unfair labor practice be an explicit ground for or necessarily implicated by the [FLRA's] decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 184 (internal quotation marks omitted). We thus concluded that we lack jurisdiction where, as in that case, the FLRA describes an unfair labor practice claim solely to "<span class="Italic">reject</span> the notion that an unfair labor practice is any part of the case before [it]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Reinforcing this requirement, we held in <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 507 F.3d 697 (D.C. Cir. 2007), that the order must "contain a substantive discussion of an unfair labor practice claim," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 700--though we later clarified in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. FLRA</span>, 665 F.3d 1339 (D.C. Cir. 2012), that the discussion need not be "explicit," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1345 (holding that when an FLRA order "necessarily implicates a statutory unfair labor practice," we have jurisdiction even if the order never "explicitly discuss[es]" the unfair labor practice).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These decisions strongly suggest that we lack subject matter jurisdiction in this case.&#x2003;True, as the Board points out, the Union alleged and the arbitrator found a statutory unfair labor practice. But under <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> what matters is the FLRA's final order--not the arbitrator's award or the initial grievance--and in that order the FLRA mentioned the Union's unfair labor practice claim only in a footnote and only to explain why it had no need to consider the claim. As we made clear in <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior</span>, the FLRA must do more than simply note the existence of an unfair labor practice claim for its order to "involve" an unfair labor practice--indeed, even explaining why it will not address an unfair labor practice argument is insufficient. The FLRA's order must, as we held in <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, reach and discuss the merits of a statutory unfair labor practice or in some "other way affect[&#8197;] substantive law regarding" a statutory issue, something the order in this case never does. 507 F.3d at 700.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Seeking to escape the clear dictate of our precedent, the Board of Governors makes two arguments. First, it contends that the FLRA's order "involves an unfair labor practice" by virtue of the Board's invocation of the "covered by" defense, "a statutory defense, [which] as such involves--or at least implicates--the question of a statutory duty to bargain." Although the FLRA maintains that the "covered by" defense applies only to statutory duties, the Board of Governors insists that the defense applies as well to at least some contractual duties, including the one the arbitrator found here. According to the Board, the arbitrator's consideration of extrinsic evidence reveals that the arbitrator looked beyond the text of the collective bargaining agreement when defining the scope of the Board's contractual duty to bargain, something the arbitrator could not have done without first rejecting the Board's statutory "covered by" defense--in other words, determining that the agreement itself fails to "cover" the impact and implementation of layoffs sufficiently to relieve the Board of any further bargaining obligation. Because, at least in this case, a "contractual duty to bargain is not independent of a statutory duty to bargain," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 42, the Board urges us to take jurisdiction on the ground that the FLRA had no basis for upholding the arbitrator's decision without at least implicitly rejecting the Board's statutory "covered by" defense. In support, the Board relies on our recent opinion in <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA</span>, 654 F.3d 91 (D.C. Cir. 2011), claiming that it stands for the proposition that contractual and statutory duties are neither separate nor independent. Thus, according to the Board, the collective bargaining agreement could provide no "separate and independent" basis for the arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Had the FLRA necessarily rejected the "covered by" defense when it upheld the arbitrator's award, we might well agree that we have subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy</span>, 665 F.3d at 1345 (taking jurisdiction where the FLRA's order necessarily found an unfair labor practice, even though the FLRA had ostensibly found only a contractual duty). But as the FLRA explains, the Board of Governors's argument misconstrues the "covered by" defense, which applies only to statutory duties. Simply put, the "covered by" defense respects the bargain the parties struck: if the agreement covers an issue in sufficient depth, then we assume the parties have already fully negotiated over that issue and therefore refrain from imposing additional statutory obligations that appear nowhere in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 654 F.3d at 94 ("If a collective bargaining agreement 'covers' a particular subject, then the parties to that agreement are absolved of any further duty to bargain about that matter during the term of the agreement.") (citations and quotation marks omitted). It would make little sense to consider such a defense when evaluating a purported contractual duty, since contractual duties are themselves products of the very bargaining the "covered by" defense is designed to respect. And given that extrinsic evidence of the mutual intent of the parties furnishes an appropriate source of insight into the meaning of contractual terms, an arbitrator's consideration of such evidence hardly transforms the contractual inquiry into a statutory one, opening the door to a "covered by" defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 214 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 466 F.3d 1079, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2006) ("[C]ourts interpret labor agreements in light of the practice, usage and custom of the parties. In particular, where the terms of a bargaining agreement are ambiguous, we look to evidence of the parties' contemporaneous understanding." (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons</span> is not to the contrary. There, unlike here, we clearly had jurisdiction because the FLRA had explicitly addressed and found a statutory unfair labor practice. 654 F.3d at 454; <span class="Italic">see also ACT</span>, 507 F.3d 699 (noting that where an unfair labor practice is explicitly discussed in the FLRA's order, our jurisdiction is clear). Nor does that decision provide any support for the Board's argument that the "covered by" defense applies to contractual duties. To be sure, after rejecting a statutory unfair labor practice claim on the ground that a particular issue was "covered by" the collective bargaining agreement, we went on to "reject...the contention" that the collective bargaining agreement provided a "'separate and independent basis' for the arbitral award." <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 654 F.3d at 97. We did so, however, not because the "covered by" defense applies to contractual duties, as the Board contends, but rather "because the arbitral award ma[de] no distinction between the purportedly 'separate' statutory and contractual grounds." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Since under these circumstances the Bureau of Prisons "was not required to file a separate exception" outlining contractual arguments, the FLRA had no basis for holding that the Bureau's failure to file such an exception waived all such arguments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the FLRA's "separate and independent basis" holding suffers from no similar defect: the arbitrator found <span class="Italic">both</span> a statutory <span class="Italic">and</span> a contractual duty, and the Board of Governors made both statutory and contractual arguments before the FLRA. Accordingly, given Board counsel's refreshingly candid concession that he knows of no cases where either the FLRA or any court has found a "covered by" defense relevant to the scope of a contractual duty, we decline the Board's invitation to do so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2522"></span>Second, the Board of Governors argues that we have subject matter jurisdiction because the FLRA's order might implicate sovereign immunity. Recall that the arbitrator interpreted the collective bargaining agreement as requiring the Board to provide employees affected by the layoffs with "priority consideration" for certain vacant positions. This requirement, the Board argues, forces it to violate a government-wide Office of Personnel Management regulation barring agencies from "assign[ing] an employee in an excepted position to a position in the competitive service," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.705(b)(6), even though the Statute prohibits agencies from entering into agreements "inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1). Thus, the Board maintains, the FLRA's order "would require management officials to violate the law, implicating principles of sovereign immunity and giving this Court jurisdiction to review such questions." Again, we disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that we always have jurisdiction to review FLRA orders that implicate principles of sovereign immunity, the order at issue here does no such thing. After all, as the FLRA clearly explained, "priority consideration" and "assignment" are separate concepts--an agency might provide a candidate "priority consideration" for a particular position yet ultimately refuse to "assign" the candidate to that position because she proved ineligible. Since the order before us mandates only "priority consideration," management officials can follow it without violating government-wide regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> Reply Br. 16 (conceding that the order would be "unobjectionable" if it mandated only "consideration" rather than "assignment").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See IUPEDJ v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20221230066">___F.4th___</a> (D.C.

U.S. Dep’t of the Navy v. FLRA, 665 F.3d 1339, 1345 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (cleaned up).

Cuba Broadcasting, 752 F.3d at 457. Because the order neither includes a substantive discussion of an unfair labor practice nor implicates such a practice, the statutory requirements for our jurisdiction are not met.”).</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit lacked jurisdiction in a challenge to FLRA's ruling on an award that resolved a dispute over agency implementation of a staffing change, challenged before an arbitrator under the collective bargaining contract but that involved no ruling on a ULP issue. When FLRA set aside the ensuing award favoring the union, <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI Miami and AFGE Local 3960,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-125.html">71 FLRA 660</a> (2020), the union sought judicial review, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3690 v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/20-1183/20-1183-2021-07-02.html">3 F.4th 384</a>, 384-88 (D.C. Cir. 2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FCI Miami employees work in several roles and departments, with the largest department being the Custody Department--staffed by "Custody" employees. Other departments are "Non-Custody" departments and are staffed by "Non-Custody" employees. Before 2016, when the Custody Department was short-staffed, FCI Miami either left positions in the Custody Department vacant or paid a Custody employee overtime. In early January 2016, FCI Miami notified AFGE that it planned to start using NonCustody employees to fill vacant Custody Department positions; it called the process "augmentation." AFGE shortly thereafter sought to negotiate the matter but FCI Miami denied the request, telling AFGE that it had implemented augmentation in accord with Article 18 of the Master Agreement, which permits FCI Miami to change the shift or assignment of Custody and Non-Custody employees: in short, FCI Miami viewed augmentation as "reassignment." After FCI Miami failed to negotiate regarding augmentation, AFGE filed a formal grievance, alleging that FCI Miami had violated both the Master Agreement and its past practices by implementing augmentation. FCI Miami responded that it had authority to institute augmentation under the Master Agreement and denied AFGE's grievance. AFGE then invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE asserts that the Authority decision involved an unfair labor practice because it "necessarily implies" an unfair labor practice. We disagree. There is no discussion, mention or implication of an unfair labor practice in the Authority decision. Further, the arbitrator award does not once mention an unfair labor practice and none of the listed issues in the award, set forth with AFGE's agreement, mentions or pertains to a statutory unfair labor practice. Even if AFGE <span class="Italic">could</span> have characterized the underlying conduct as a statutory unfair labor practice, it did not do so. In fact, this seems to be a quintessential example of exactly the scenario we discussed in <span class="Italic">Overseas:</span> AFGE "affirmatively chose to invoke the agreement, not the statute. It must now live with the consequences that flow from invocation of this theory. [It] cannot be permitted at this late stage to transform its grievance claim into a statutory claim." <span class="Italic">Overseas,</span> 824 F.2d at 69. AFGE chose the arbitration grievance process, framing the issues as contractual until it received an unfavorable ruling from the Authority. At that point, AFGE petitioned our court for review and asserted that its claim was an unfair labor practice all along, even though its earlier arguments, the arbitrator award and the Authority decision all focused on the Master Agreement--and, to a lesser extent, the MOU--without mention of statutory unfair labor practices. The consequence of AFGE's choice is that we do not have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent">An FLRA decision was not reviewable that reduced a fee award arising in arbitration, even though the arbitration included, among others, a ULP issue. The fee decision did not directly implicate a ULP and was not reviewable as a decision involving a ULP, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2510 v. FLRA</span>, 453 F.3d 500, 504-06 (D.C. Cir. 2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the order now before us the Authority addressed only the fee award, but the Union contends the order is nonetheless reviewable because the arbitrator's "principal award," meaning his award on the merits of the grievance, "is replete with findings of statutory [unfair labor practices]" and there are "repeated references to these findings in the [Authority's] decision." Actually, the arbitrator found only one unfair labor practice in his decision on the merits, namely, the employer's refusal to permit Roach access to the DFAS facility. That other statutory violations or violations of the collective bargaining agreement "<span class="Italic">could be</span> characterized as...statutory unfair labor practice[s] will not suffice" to make the order reviewable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 67; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(8) (unfair labor practice for agency to "fail or refuse to comply with any provision of" Statute). But more to the point, it is not the arbitrator's award on the merits of the grievance that must involve an unfair labor practice as the predicate for judicial review; it is the order of the Authority that is the subject of the petition for judicial review--in this case the Authority's order reviewing the arbitrator's fee award--that must involve an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). In the latter order, there is neither a single mention of &#x00A7; 7116 (unfair labor practices) nor any discussion of the arbitrator's finding of an unfair labor practice other than passing references when the Authority recounts the issues presented in this "fairly straightforward case." As we have said before, a "passing reference does not satisfy the requirement" that the order involve an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">DOI,</span> 26 F.3d at 184.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also suggests the order involves an unfair labor practice because the Authority must have considered the arbitrator's holding that the employer had engaged in an unfair labor practice when the Authority approved the arbitrator's finding that the DFAS knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits, which finding was the basis for its holding that an award of the attorney's fee was in the interest of justice. Both the Authority and the arbitrator, however, considered the likelihood the DFAS would not prevail only with respect to issues resolved under the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the employer, namely, the validity of Roach's discipline for being absent without leave and for a lack of candor. Neither the arbitrator nor the Authority considered whether the DFAS should have known it would be unable to defend its having denied Roach access to its facility, which is what the arbitrator held was an unfair labor practice. If the Authority in the order under review had considered whether the DFAS should have known it would not prevail with respect to the only unfair labor practice the arbitrator found, then perhaps the order would have "involved" an unfair labor practice, but that is not what happened. In the order under review, there was no discussion at all of the arbitrator's finding of an unfair labor practice in his earlier decision on the merits of the Union's grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's most promising, but ultimately unpersuasive, argument is that an unfair labor practice was "necessarily implicated" in the Authority's decision, <span class="Italic">OEA,</span> 824 F.2d at 68, because it would have been "impossible for the [Authority] to review the reasonableness of the fee determination, without analyzing the research, briefing, and presentation of [the unfair labor practice] issues" raised in the grievance. As the Union acknowledged at oral argument, by this logic we would always have jurisdiction to review an order of the Authority reviewing an arbitrator's award of attorneys' fees if the underlying dispute involved an unfair labor practice. As explained below, we cannot read the exception to the jurisdictional bar so broadly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Statute does not expressly tell us "how broadly 'involves [an unfair labor practice]' should be construed," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 65, we are guided by the rationale for this exception to the otherwise absolute bar to judicial review in &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1). The exception functions, as the Authority persuasively explains, to insure uniformity in the case law concerning unfair labor practices. By making reviewable every order involving an unfair labor practice claim, whether it arises from a complaint issued by the General Counsel or from a dispute submitted to an arbitrator, the Congress made certain there would be a single, uniform body of case law concerning unfair labor practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We see no plausible rationale for the alternative rule implicitly advanced by the Union, namely, that our review extends to any order in a case in which an unfair labor practice was involved--regardless whether the unfair labor practice is involved in the particular order of which review <span id="page_2523"></span>is sought. We have previously acknowledged that an order may be reviewable even if the Authority did not there in address an unfair labor practice "on the merits," <span class="Italic">OEA,</span> 824 F.2d at 71, but we cautioned at the same time that to be reviewable the substance of the unfair labor practice must at least "be discussed in some way in, or be some part of, the Authority's order." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 65. Without even that much involvement there is no risk the Authority will leave the path of the law of unfair labor practices and yet escape the review that would bring it back to the straight and narrow. Where there is no such risk, neither is there any reason for the Congress to have departed from its established policy" favoring arbitration of labor disputes and accordingly granting arbitration results substantial finality," which policy underlies the general rule in &#x00A7; 7123 barring judicial review of arbitral awards. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 63.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in <span class="Italic">OEA</span> we held an order did involve an unfair labor practice because the Authority had reviewed an arbitrator's decision that arbitration was precluded by a previous unfair labor practice charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 71. The Authority did not address the unfair labor practice on the merits but it did more than simply refer to the finding; it was required" to make a detailed assessment of the precise nature of a statutory unfair labor practice charge, and then to compare the substance of that charge with the substance of the grievance before the arbitrator" prior to concluding the two claims were identical. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 71.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in contrast, the Authority did not engage at all with the substance of the unfair labor practice. The Authority considered only whether the hours charged by the union attorney were reasonable, taking into account both his experience and the relatively uncomplicated nature of the case. Because the Authority's decision has no bearing upon the law of unfair labor practices, its order does not "involve[&#8197;] an unfair labor practice," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1), and is not judicially reviewable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the position the Government took at oral argument, our decision should not be read to establish a simplistic rule barring review of an order that deals solely with a fee award while allowing review of an order in which the Authority addresses both an unfair labor practice and a fee issue. In the latter case, the rationale for review of the order would obtain to the extent, and only to the extent, the unfair labor practice was involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> Exception</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues we should exercise jurisdiction pursuant to <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne,</span> in which the Supreme Court held a district court may, in what we have called "exceptional circumstances," <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer,</span> 237 U.S. App. D.C. 61, 735 F.2d 1497, 1500 (1984), review the decision of an agency even in the face of a statutory provision that precludes judicial review. 358 U.S. 184, 79 S. Ct. 180, 3 L. Ed. 2d 210. More particularly, the agency's alleged conduct must be "contrary to a specific [statutory] prohibition" that is both "clear and mandatory,"<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 188, and the party aggrieved must have no other "meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its statutory rights," <span class="Italic">Bd. of Governors, Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc</span>., 502 U.S. 32, 43, 112 S. Ct. 459, 116 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument from <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> comes too late. A dozen years ago we rejected the suggestion that <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> authorizes the court of appeals to enforce a clear statutory prohibition in the first instance. "The <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> exception," we explained, "is premised on the <span class="Italic">original</span> federal subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts. Even if <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> did apply to the [Authority's alleged] actions, it would therefore not confer jurisdiction upon us to hear the case." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury v.

Kyne </span>nor its progeny support jurisdiction in this court to consider the present petition</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit declined to review an FLRA decision that considered an arbitration award when, although a ULP issue was raised by the union in a grievance concerning a smoking ban, the arbitrator did not decide the ULP allegations as an issue in the case, and FLRA did not directly treat the ULP issue as a material point in its decision. Over a persuasive dissent by Judge Tate, <span class="Italic">ACT New York State Council v. FLRA</span>, 507 F.3d 697, 698-700 (D.C. Cir. 2007), determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...When the grievance was not resolved, the Union invoked its right to binding arbitration and added an allegation that DMNA's unilateral implementation of the policy constituted an unfair labor practice because it was taken in clear and patent breach of the collective bargaining agreement's negotiation provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties were unable to stipulate to the issues before the arbitrator.&#x2003;She reviewed their proposed issues and found that, "[a]t the heart of this case is a dispute over the interpretation and application of the language of the Parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement." She then framed the issues as "Did the Agency violate the Collective Bargaining Agreement when it issued a new smoking policy letter on 23 July 2003?" and "If so, what should the remedy be?" She concluded that the DMNA had not violated the collective bargaining agreement because the smoking ban was a statutory requirement and therefore did not fall within the agreement's requirement that rules "within the purview" of the DMNA be negotiated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed exceptions to the arbitral decision with the Federal Labor Relations Authority arguing, in pertinent part, that the arbitrator exceeded her authority when she failed to address its unfair labor practice allegations. The Authority denied the Union's exceptions, finding that the arbitrator had not erred in framing the issues as arising solely under the collective bargaining agreement. Under Authority precedent, where parties do not stipulate to the issues before the arbitrator, the arbitrator has broad discretion to frame the issues. <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, N.Y.

No. 134 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1367</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. 187, 190 (2004)). Therefore, in this case, because there was no stipulation that an unfair labor practice claim was before the arbitrator, the arbitrator was not obligated to frame the issues as including an unfair labor practice claim. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Authority deferred to the arbitrator's framing of the issues and dismissed all exceptions to her award. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Union sought reconsideration, which was denied, then petitioned for review by this Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We lack jurisdiction to review the Authority's order affirming the arbitral decision because it does not "involve[&#8197;] an unfair labor practice under section 711[6]" of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1).[*] The Authority's order instead involves rules applicable to arbitration which, when applied in this dispute, resulted in the unfair labor practice claim's exclusion from review. We find that this secondary effect on the unfair labor practice claim is not sufficient to qualify the order as one that "involves an unfair labor practice" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] Although the statute refers to "section 7118," the reference "has been recognized to be an error; the correct reference is to section 7116." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2510 v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute limits our review to orders of the Authority which involve unfair labor practices in order to balance a "strong Congressional policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes," <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 63 (D.C. Cir. 1987), with a Congressional intent for "uniformity in the case law concerning unfair labor practices," <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2510 v. FLRA</span>, 453 F.3d 500, 505 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The Statute contains a "two-track system for resolving labor disputes." <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 62. A party aggrieved by an unfair labor practice may go down either track, but not both. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d). Under the first track, not pursued by the Union in this case, a party may file an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority's General Counsel, who will investigate and issue a complaint, if warranted. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>&#x00A7; 7118(a). The matter is then adjudicated by the Authority, and the Authority's decision is subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7118, 7123. Under the second track, which was followed here, a party may file a grievance in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement that alleges an unfair labor practice, a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, or both. The grievance is subject to binding arbitration, <span class="Italic">id. </span>&#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii), and the arbitral award is subject to review by the Authority, <span class="Italic">id. </span>&#x00A7; 7122(a). The Authority's order is not subject to judicial review "unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 711[6]" of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>&#x00A7; 7123(a)(1). The second track is the track for those who "prefer[&#8197;] to benefit from the relatively expeditious and (presumably) final result that arbitration promise[s]." <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 66. By offering its one level of review at the administrative level, it protects Congress's interest in providing "arbitration results substantial finality." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 63. Its limited exception that allows a second level of review--judicial review--furthers Congress's other stated interest of ensuring "a single, uniform body of case law concerning unfair labor practices." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2510</span>, 453 F.3d at 505.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reading the exception broadly, then, would be contrary to "the proarbitration policy Congress articulated in passing the Act." <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 66. For that reason, we have found that judicial review is only available where the "substance of the unfair labor practice" is "'discussed in some way in, or [is] some part of, the Authority's order.'" <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2510</span>, 453 F.3d at 505 (quoting <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 65). "A mere 'passing reference' to an unfair labor practice will not suffice," <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 503, nor will the fact that "the underlying conduct could be characterized as a statutory unfair labor practice," <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 66. Instead, "the conduct must actually be so characterized and the claim pursued, by whatever route, as a statutory unfair labor practice, not as something else." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 66.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2524"></span>The order need not address an unfair labor practice "on the merits" to "involve" an unfair labor practice, but it does need to include some "sort of substantive evaluation of a statutory unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 71. For example, in <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, the Authority did not decide an unfair labor practice claim on the merits because it concluded that the claim was precluded by a previously-filed claim. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Its order nonetheless "involved" an unfair labor practice because it included a detailed substantive analysis and comparison of the two unfair labor practice claims such that its discussion of unfair labor practices was "no mere citation in passing." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 70-71.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, we have found that an order did not "involve" an unfair labor practice where the "arbitrator's decision clearly frame[d] the issue as one arising solely under the parties' collective bargaining agreements" and the Authority's order "repeat[ed] the arbitrator's statement of the issue as one sounding in contract." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Interior v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 179, 184 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("<span class="Italic">DOI</span>"). We have also found that the standard was not met where the Authority's order reviewing an arbitration fee award contained "neither a single mention of &#x00A7; 7116 (unfair labor practices) nor any discussion of the arbitrator's finding of an unfair labor practice other than passing references" to the issues in the underlying dispute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2510</span>, 453 F.3d at 504. Where an order does not contain a substantive discussion of an unfair labor practice claim, there is no need to depart from Congress's "established policy 'favoring arbitration of labor disputes and accordingly granting arbitration results substantial finality,' which...underlies the general rule in &#x00A7; 7123 barring judicial review of arbitral awards" because "there is no risk the Authority will leave the path of the law of unfair labor practices and yet escape the review that would bring it back to the straight and narrow." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 505 (quoting <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 63).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's order in this case does not "involve" an unfair labor practice under our precedent. The Authority did not engage in any substantive discussion of the Union's unfair labor practice claim in its order, but instead explicitly found that the arbitrator was justified in concluding that the substance of the unfair labor practice claim was not part of the dispute. As in <span class="Italic">DOI</span>, the "arbitrator's decision clearly frames the issue as one arising solely under the parties' collective bargaining agreements," the "arbitrator analyzes the case as an alleged breach of contract," and the Authority's order "repeats the arbitrator's statement of the issue as one sounding in contract." <span class="Italic">DOI</span>, 26 F.3d at 184. Therefore, as in <span class="Italic">DOI</span>, the order does not "involve" an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that if the Union wished to protect its right to judicial review of any possible unfair labor practice claims, it could have utilized the first track provided by the Statute which leads to judicial review. Because it instead decided to proceed through the second track, it is bound by the Statute's ban on judicial review unless the Authority's order "involves" an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union fails in its attempt to characterize this order as involving an unfair labor practice by pointing to its effect on the Union's unfair labor practice allegations. While the Authority ensured that the Union's unfair labor practice claim will not be considered on its merits by affirming the arbitrator's framing of the issues, our caselaw is clear that the Authority's order itself must have some "bearing upon the law of unfair labor practices" in order to qualify as an order that "involve[s] an unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2510</span>, 453 F.3d at 505. A passing reference to an unfair labor practice or a mere effect on the reviewability of an unfair labor practice claim is not enough. Because the Authority's order in this case deals solely with arbitration procedure, and neither discusses nor in any other way affects substantive law regarding unfair labor practices, it does not "involve" an unfair labor practice. We have no jurisdiction to review the order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reasoning of the cases precluding judicial review of arbitration awards that lack stated ULP grounds was extended to FLRA decisions reviewing arbitrators' counsel fee awards. Further, no jurisdiction was provided by the Administrative Procedure Act, for "judicial review under that Act is not available if review of agency action is precluded by other law." <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Metal Trades Council v. FLRA</span>, 963 F.2d 38, 40 (3d Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Andrade v. Lauer</span>, 729 F.2d 1475, n.16 (D.C. Cir. 1984) ("[t]he statute specifically exempts FLRA decisions concerning arbitration awards from the circuit court's jurisdiction, unless the FLRA decision involves an unfair labor practice").</p>
<p class="noindent">The Ninth Circuit lacked jurisdiction to review an FLRA determination on an arbitration award unless a ULP was an explicit or necessary ground for the final FLRA order. <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 708 F.2d 1417, 1420-21 (9th Cir. 1983).<span class="Italic"> Marshals Serv. </span>considered the jurisdiction over an appeal by an agency from an FLRA decision on exceptions to an arbitration award. The dispute was whether the agency violated a contract by not providing advance notice of changes in working conditions. The court determined that if FLRA confines its decision to a contract violation, jurisdiction is lacking for judicial review of a ULP:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The question presented by the statute, and on this appeal, is whether, when the arbitration path is chosen and a contract violation is the focus of the arbitration, we nevertheless may review the Authority's disposition of exceptions to the award if the underlying contract violation can be characterized as an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Though the statutory command is not entirely clear, we think the proper rule is this: where arbitration has been elected and the Authority reviews exceptions to an award, we have no jurisdiction to review the Authority's determination unless an unfair labor practice is either an explicit or a necessary ground for the final order issued by the Authority. Though certain exceptions to the rule may present themselves as the law in this field evolves, none are suggested here. Under the rule we state, there is no jurisdiction in the instant case since the collective bargaining agreement itself was the basis for both the arbitrator's determination and the Authority's review of the arbitration award. To say that we have jurisdiction whenever a contract dispute can also fit within the unfair labor practice sections of the Act, though it has not been so treated either by the arbitrator or the Authority, would be to give too little scope and effect to the arbitration process and to the final review function of the Authority, procedures deemed important to the expeditious review that Congress made a central part of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Review of exceptions to the arbitration award by the Authority itself, without judicial review unless an unfair labor practice is necessarily implicated, is the explicit congressional design.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion is in accord with that of the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 675 F.2d 612 (4th Cir. 1982). The court there found no jurisdiction to review a determination of the Authority confirming an arbitration award. As here, the court pointed out that, though the dispute in question could have been litigated as an unfair labor practice, in fact it was not, and that the Authority in its determination confined itself to the contract violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he issue is whether, all having conceded that the Act applies, our appellate jurisdiction may turn upon an election of the complaining party and the rationale for disposition adopted by the Authority. The Act itself having conferred an election between arbitration under the contract and the filing of an unfair labor practice complaint, and the Authority having determined to stay within the arbitration framework in its decision, it is appropriate for us to acknowledge the arbitration and contract processes and to decline jurisdiction, as the statute compels.</p>
<p class="noindent">Drawing support from the Ninth Circuit determination in <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 708 F.2d 1417, 1420 (9th Cir. 1983), that review may only be obtained if an "unfair labor practice is either explicit or a necessary ground for the final order issued by the Authority," the D.C. Circuit found that in one of the consolidated cases before it (involving a unilateral change in working conditions resolved by an arbitrator and reviewed by FLRA) there was no ULP involved: although the conduct could have been characterized as a ULP, it was not so characterized by the parties, the arbitrator, or FLRA. The other case, however, directly involving an FLRA determination on exceptions to an award that the grievance was precluded by a prior ULP charge, did involve a ULP determination to the extent that the FLRA was required to make a detailed comparison between the earlier ULP and the subsequent grievance to determine whether the former blocked the latter. The court declined to adopt FLRA's argument that its decision would involve a ULP only when it decided the ULP on the merits; it was enough to "involve" a ULP under the statute. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Tonetti v. FLRA</span>, 776 F.2d 929, 931 (11th Cir. 1985) (no substantive review in the appellate court if there was no assertion before the arbitrator of a ULP and FLRA's decision sustaining the award that made no reference to a violation of 5 USC 7116; a ULP was not a "necessary ground" for the FLRA decision).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, 675 F.2d 612, 613-614 (4th Cir. 1982), dismissed a union's judicial review petition that sought to set aside an FLRA decision sustaining the award of an arbitrator who found the agency committed no breach of an agreement by failing to negotiate a particular proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a) enumerates what acts on the part of an agency may be an unfair labor practice. The only one having possible application here is &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5), "to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization as required by this chapter..." While we think that the dispute between the union and Social Security could have been litigated in the context of a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5), the fact is that the union invoked the grievance procedure and arbitration on an entirely different theory. It sought, in effect, a declaratory judgment; it did not assert that Social Security had violated &#x00A7; 7116 and the arbitrator did not advert to any violation of &#x00A7; 7116.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Authority the dispute between the parties was whether a contractual undertaking to negotiate had been superseded by a later Congressional enactment.&#x2003;The issue was one of negotiability and whether there was a duty to negotiate, not a claim that an unquestioned duty to negotiate had been breached. The decision of the Authority served to spell out the extent of the duty to negotiate and did not find that there had been any breach of that duty. As a consequence we think that neither the arbitrator nor the Authority decided an unfair labor practice charge, and therefore we lack jurisdiction to give judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent">The question of whether a potential ULP establishes jurisdiction for court review of an FLRA order on exceptions to an arbitrator's award was posed, <span id="page_2525"></span>and answered in the negative, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 v. FLRA</span>, 951 F.2d 276, 277-79 (10th Cir. 1991). A union official was suspended, she grieved, and an arbitrator found that she could not be subjected to disciplinary action because she was a full-time union representative. On exceptions FLRA set aside the award. FLRA decided that management could not be prevented from disciplining union representatives for flagrant misconduct. The Tenth Circuit dismissed the appeal as beyond its jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained in detail in such decisions as <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 824 F.2d 61 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the governing statutory scheme establishes a two-track system for resolving labor disputes....&#8197;The aggrieved party may file a statutory unfair labor practice charge with FLRA General Counsel, who determines whether a complaint should issue. If a complaint ensues, the matter is adjudicated by FLRA, subject to judicial review in the court of appeals. On the other hand, the aggrieved party may elect instead to pursue the matter through the statutorily mandated grievance procedure established in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. If resolution by grievance fails initially, the dispute may be brought before an arbitrator, whose determination is subject to <span class="Italic">final</span> review by FLRA. A key feature of the grievance-arbitration process is that once FLRA has rendered its decision, judicial review is unavailable "unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 711[6] of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1). Thus, "[b]oth routes offer one level of review--the statutory route provides for judicial review of the FLRA's decision and the grievance route provides for FLRA review of the arbitrator's decision."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue raised by FLRA's Motion to Dismiss, then, is whether the FLRA order resolving AFGE's grievance "involves an unfair labor practice." The few courts that have wrestled with this somewhat vague language have all basically agreed on a deliberately narrow construction--an order of the FLRA satisfies this requirement only if an unfair labor practice is either an explicit or necessary (implied) ground for disposition of the arbitrated grievance....&#8197;The mere fact that a contractual grievance <span class="Italic">could have</span> been pursued, instead, as a statutory unfair labor practice does not suffice to support federal court jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ultimate issue presented for arbitration here was characterized by the arbitrator as follows: "Was the fourteen day suspension of the Grievant, Cheryl V. Prentice, for just cause? If not what shall be the remedy?"...&#8197;The dispositive ground for the arbitrator's decision was that Ms. Prentice, "working full time for the Union and under its control and direction at all times material to this proceeding[,]...was not subject to the orders of Agency management in an employer-employee relationship so that her refusal to obey Agency management directives constituted insubordination."...&#8197;In short, "the Agency did not have the right...to take direct disciplinary action against an employee that it had provided 100% to the union pursuant to their collective bargaining agreement." The Agency petitioned for review by FLRA, arguing (1) the arbitrator erred in concluding that Ms. Prentice, by virtue of her union representative status, ceased to be an employee subject to the management directives of her employing agency and (2) the egregious nature of her conduct brought Ms. Prentice within the proper sphere of management's right to discipline employees....&#8197;As already noted, FLRA adopted the Agency's position and set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At no point in their analyses did the arbitrator or the FLRA consider, explicitly or impliedly, whether Ms. Prentice or the Agency had committed a statutory unfair labor practice under &#x00A7; 7116. Neither party's position required, as a prerequisite for relief under the collective bargaining agreement, a finding that its opponent had violated &#x00A7; 7116. While the decisions rendered below may well indicate how a (foregone) correlative unfair labor practice charge would have fared, that would be the case in any instance where the dispute could have been pursued on either procedural track--and we have already seen that it is the particular procedure invoked and disposition obtained, rather than the dual remedial potential of the claim, that controls its characterization for purposes of judicial review under &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1)....&#8197;Indeed, even where a prior arbitration determination provides the necessary basis for a subsequent unfair labor practice charge regarding conduct in violation thereof, 7123(a)(1) continues to preclude "indirect" judicial review of the former. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 792 F.2d at 28-29. In short, to support judicial review under &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1), an unfair labor practice must be an actual part, not just a foregone alternative characterization or a potential consequence, of the underlying controversy. Such is not the case here, and AFGE's assertion that discipline of a union representative such as Ms. Prentice for protected activity could (also) constitute a statutory unfair labor practice...is beside the point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For its own, perhaps thoughtful reasons, AFGE chose to pursue this dispute with the Agency as a grievance under the parties' collective bargaining agreement, rather than as an unfair labor practice charge under the statute, and must now accept the consequences of that decision. AFGE "cannot be permitted at this late stage to transform its grievance claim into a statutory claim. Accordingly,...FLRA's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction is well-founded."...</p>
