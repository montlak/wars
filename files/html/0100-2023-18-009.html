However, the Board's authority to review whether the agency complied with its regulations derives from our preexisting obligation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), and does not stand in need of creation or enlargement. <span class="Italic">See Romero</span>, 527 F.3d at 1328; <span class="Italic">Schnedar</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 246, &#x00B6; 9. To the extent the regulation may purport to restrict that authority, we do not follow it, as the agency is without authority to so relieve the Board of its statutory obligations. <span class="Italic">Cf. Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 20 (2011) (declining to follow Office of Personnel Management regulations purporting to exempt removals under 5 C.F.R. part 731 from adjudication under chapter 75 standards). Accordingly, we will consider whether the agency complied with chapter 8 of DoD 5200.2-R in reaching its decision to indefinitely suspend the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to military regulations, <span class="Italic">Deck v. Dept. of Army</span>, 7 MSPR 606, 608 (1981), opined:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Summarized, "an agency's failure to comply with a statutory procedure provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 is not reversible error <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but is instead considered under the harmful error standard, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)], under which the appellant must establish that the error is likely to have caused the agency to have reached a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. USPS</span>, DC-0752-11-0867-I-2 (NP 8/5/2014).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Foret v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 437, 442 &#x00B6; 10, 2007 MSPB 97 (2007), involving a 30-day suspension for an employee's refusal to take a drug test, determined that the agency's regulations were not followed when a commanding officer ordered the test without an intermediate supervisory evaluation and recommendation; nevertheless, the error was not harmful because the appellant did not prove that the test would not have been administered had the proper process been followed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency erred by having the commander order the drug test, the appellant did not show that this error was harmful. To show harm, the appellant needed to prove that if the agency had followed applicable procedures it would not have suspended him. He failed to do this. There is no statement or testimony from the appellant's first-line supervisor on this issue. Further, there is no evidence in the record regarding whether the appellant had other supervisors who could have initiated the test, and whether they would not have done so under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee must meet a condition before a regulatory protection becomes available, the harmful error analysis need not be applied to the steps the employer should have taken had the precondition been met. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 93 MSPR 494, 500 &#x00B6; 14 (2003) (employee failed to provide sufficient medical documentation to support a request for LWOP: "Because the appellant failed to provide this required information, despite the agency's specific and repeated requests that she do so, the agency was not required to consult a physician to review the appellant's incomplete medical diagnosis and did not violate the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.104.The appellant has shown no error in the arbitrator's legal analysis of her harmful error claim.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem is in the distinction between a harmful error (requiring reversal of a result under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A)) and a case that requires reversal if a decision is not in accordance with law under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C). The harmful error rule requires a showing that but for the error, the result would likely have been different. If a result must be reversed for not being in accordance with the law, the fact that the result would likely have been no different should not alter the requirements of the law and the need for reversal. In a WIGI case, <span class="Italic">Ommaya v. NIH</span>, 726 F.2d 827 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the court concluded that the MSPB should have, but did not, use a preponderance of evidence standard in the evaluation of a WIGI denial. The government argued that the harmful error doctrine should have been applied, meaning that to be successful, the employee would have been required to show that not only was the wrong adjudicatory standard applied, but that the result would likely have differed. The court rejected that argument: the error permeated the entire proceeding because all the evidence was evaluated under an inappropriate standard. The court did not entirely resolve the harmful error/error of law dichotomy, but it at least hinted that a fundamental adjudicatory error would not be evaluated under the harmful error rule. The court declined to undertake its own independent assessment of the evidence, citing <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 720 F.2d 209 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The case was remanded for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board attempted to distinguish harmful error and an action not in accordance with the law in <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 112, 119-20 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The employee was given less than seven days to offer his reply to the agency. The statute defining entitlement to notice was violated. The issue was whether the statutory violation rendered the action not in accordance with law and reversible, or whether the violation <span id="Page_3138"></span>of statute should be analyzed for prejudice to the employee under the harmful error standard. The Board chose the latter analysis: if all statutory violations made actions "not in accordance with the law" and therefore reversible, the same result would have to be reached as to regulatory violations, rendering meaningless the harmful error provision. To avoid this result, the Board made the decision to "read the harmful error provision as applicable to all procedural errors and to read the 'not in accordance with the law' provision as applicable to other unlawful actions." <span class="Italic">Baracco</span>, 15 MSPR at 120. The analysis was followed in <span class="Italic">Olson v. FAA</span>, 23 MSPR 160, 162 n.3 (1984), confirmed in <span class="Italic">Schapansky v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 477 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and restated by <span class="Italic">Doe v. DOJ</span>, 121 MSPR 596, 603-04 &#x00B6; 12, 2014 MSPB 75 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(c)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that an adverse action may not be sustained if the employee "(A) shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision;...or (C) shows that the decision was not in accordance with law." The "harmful error" provision of section 7701(c)(2) is applicable to all procedural errors, such as the one here, while the "not in accordance with law" provision is applicable to other unlawful actions. <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 112, 120 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Adams v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir. 1984). To hold otherwise would render the harmful error provision meaningless because all violations of agency procedure would be reviewed as "not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Baracco</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 112, 120-21 (explaining the interplay between these two provision of section 7701(c)(2) in the context of an agency's failure to provide 7-days' notice to answer a proposed adverse action as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2)); <span class="Italic">see Schnedar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 12 (2014) (evaluating under a harmful error standard an agency's failure to comply with applicable regulations in instituting an adverse action based on the revocation of an appellant's security clearance); <span class="Italic">Ulep v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 6 (2014) (conducting the same analysis where an agency issued an adverse action based on the suspension of the appellant's security clearance without the procedural protections afforded under applicable regulations). Because the error at issue here was the agency's application of its procedures, the harmful error standard is applicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baracco</span> essentially restated the question: how does one distinguish a procedural error and "all other unlawful errors"? <span class="Italic">Handy v. USPS</span>, 754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985), affirmed statements in <span class="Italic">Baracco</span> that an error concerning an employee's reply right is to be analyzed under the harmful error rule rather than under the provision of the law that requires an agency decision to be set aside if it is not in accordance with the law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We would add only that paragraphs (A) and (C) are not directed to the same end. Harmful error in procedures (paragraph A) raises the question: Did the wrongful procedure harm the employee in the presentation of his defense so that a different result might have been reached? Paragraph (C), on the other hand, is directed <span class="Italic">to the decision</span> itself. Was the decision in its entirety in accordance with law? The harmful error provision is part of the law and, thus, negates a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule with respect to any procedural error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Further explanation of the distinction between an action based on harmful error and an action not in accordance with law arrived with <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 683-84 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to harmful error under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board cannot sustain an agency action if the appellant "shows that the decision was not in accordance with law" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C). The legislative history of the Reform Act does not shed any light on the meaning of this provision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board first applied the "not in accordance with law" standard in <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPB 282, 8 MSPR 624 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Cuellar</span>, the Board held that an Office of Personnel Management regulation, which permitted an agency to place an employee on "emergency suspension" without any procedural rights during the advance notice period of a removal action, was invalid and thus the "suspension" was "not in accordance with law" and must also be reversed for "harmful error."... Thereafter, in <span class="Italic">Baracco</span>, 15 MSPR 112, the Board distinguished the concept of "harmful error" from "not in accordance with law." The Board stated that "harmful error" applies to "all procedural errors," whereas the "not in accordance with law" standard applies "to other unlawful actions."... The Federal Circuit subsequently provided additional guidance on the "not in accordance with law" standard in <span class="Italic">Handy</span>, 754 F.2d 335. The court stated that the "not in accordance with law" standard "is directed to the decision itself. Was the decision in its entirety in accordance with law?"...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Handy</span> and <span class="Italic">Baracco</span>, we find that an appealable action should also be reversed as "not in accordance with law," even if minimum constitutional due process consistent with <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> was afforded to an appellant and he has not shown harmful error under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), if the action is unlawful in its entirety, i.e., if there is no legal authority for the agency's action.... Thus, when an agency has no legal authority for taking an action, such as an "emergency suspension" effected during the advance notice period of a removal action, that action is "not in accordance with law" and must be reversed under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Handy</span> was relied on in the furlough appeals of <span class="Italic">In re IRS, Southeast Region v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0752-14-0040-I-1 (NP 9/15/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c), an "agency's decision may not be sustained...if the employee or applicant for employment (A) shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision;...or (C) shows that the decision was not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), (C). The Board has recognized that these two defenses, although similar, address separate species of agency error. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 12 (2014). The harmful error provision of section 7701(c)(2) is applicable to all procedural errors, while the not-in-accordance-with-law provision is applicable to other unlawful actions. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To succeed on a not-in-accordance-with-law affirmative defense, an appellant must establish that there is no legal authority for the action. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 486, 488-89 (1993). That is, the Board must determine whether the decision itself, in its entirety, was not in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 683 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Handy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). Applying this standard, the Board has overturned an agency action as not in accordance with law where, for example, the individual who imposed the challenged adverse action had retired when the decision letter was signed and thus had no legal authority to take the challenged action. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 488-89.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Handy</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Harp v. Dept. of Army</span>, 791 F.2d 161, 163 (Fed.

We are not persuaded that we should apply a different standard when reviewing the violation of a statutory procedural right alleged to have been committed by the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2111 (1982). Accordingly, we reject petitioner's arguments that the harmful error standard does not apply to a procedural requirement imposed on the board by statute."). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 63 F.3d 1107, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (applying the harmful error rule to the failure of the agency to decide a Chapter 43 case within a statutory period of 30 days following the notice of proposed action). It is insufficient to show that a statutory violation occurred, for example, denial of the opportunity to make an oral reply. There must be a showing of harmful error. <span class="Italic">Orphinuk v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2571); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 670, 671 n.2 (1985) (failure of an agency to serve the appellant with a removal proposal was reversible error because it was harmful); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kotteakos v. United States</span>, 328 U.S. 750 (1946) (the harmful error doctrine should not be applied to departures from the constitutional norm or to an express statutory requirement)<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Ramey v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 463, 467 (1996) ("If an adverse action is predicated on the agency's erroneous interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, such adverse action is in violation of law, and it may not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency has not exercised its legal authority to take an appealable action, it is not according to law, <span class="Italic">McCollum v. NCUA</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1265794.html">417 F.3d 1332</a>, 1339-40 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Handy v. United States Postal Service,</span> 754 F.2d 335 (Fed. Cir. 1985), this court acknowledged that there is some tension in the Board's jurisdictional statute between the "harmful error" and "not in accordance with law" standards of review. In that case, we held that a decision may be in accordance with law even though a statutory right has been erroneously denied. We noted that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2) provides for overturning an agency decision where the employee "'(A) shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision...[or] (C) shows that the decision was not in accordance with law.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 337 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2) (1982)). In agreeing with the Board's reconciliation of these provisions, we said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We would add only that paragraphs (A) and (C) are not directed to the same end. Harmful error in procedures (paragraph A) raises the question: Did the wrongful procedure harm the employee in the presentation of his defense so that a different result might have been reached? Paragraph (C), on the other hand, is directed to the decision itself. Was the decision in its entirety in accordance with law?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 337-38 (footnote omitted). Where the decision itself is not in accordance with law, there is no need to show harmful error, as the Board held in <span class="Italic">Hamilton,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. at 488. Because McCollum is challenging the removal decision itself, the appropriate standard of review before the Board is whether that decision was in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, only the agency may take action against an employee. Where the agency has not acted, an employee's removal cannot be in accordance with law. The fact that NCUA has not removed McCollum is not a mere procedural defect. <span id="Page_3139"></span>Instead, the removal decision itself does not exist. Because NCUA did not remove McCollum, his removal was not in accordance with law.
