<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-44"><span class="space">h.</span> Presumed Agency Good Faith; "Irrefragable Proof" Standard</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 WPEA amended 5 USC 2302(b)(14) to state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ny presumption relating to the performance of a duty by an employee whose conduct is the subject of a disclosure as defined under subsection (a)(2)(D) may be rebutted by substantial evidence,...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2004 there was debate, engendered by the 1999 decision of the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">LaChance v. White</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, of whether there was a burden to show the reasonableness of an allegation of mismanagement by "irrefragable proof" in order to overcome a presumption of good faith in the execution of the duties of public officials. In a subsequent iteration of the prolonged <span class="Italic">White</span> litigation, <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the panel specifically disclaimed the irrefragable proof formulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board properly rejected the government's argument below that disclosure of gross mismanagement required a showing of "irrefragable proof" that agency officials did not perform their duties correctly, <span class="Italic">White V</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. at 7-10, and the government wisely makes no attempt to renew this argument on review. The WPA does not require that whistleblowers establish gross mismanagement by irrefragable proof. Rather, we specifically held in <span class="Italic">White IV</span> that "the proper test is this: could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence gross mismanagement?" <span class="Italic">White IV</span>, 174 F.3d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">LaChance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1379-81 (Fed. Cir. 1999), commented, through a decision written by Chief Judge Mayer, in an appeal involving the reasonableness of the belief of an appellant in his whistleblowing allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, review of the Air Force's policy and implementation via the QES standards might well show them to be entirely appropriate, even if not the best option. Indeed, this review would start out with a "presumption that public officers perform their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law and governing regulations.... And this presumption stands unless there is 'irrefragable proof to the contrary.'" <span class="Italic">Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Johnson</span>, 8 F.3d 791, 795 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <span class="Italic">cf. Staton v. United States</span>, 228 Ct. Cl. 797, 807 (1981) (rejecting whistleblower claim of employee removed for unsatisfactory performance because "[t]he presumption that Government officials act in good faith stands unrebutted").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The meaning and lineage of the "irrefragable proof" standard imposed by the Federal Circuit, creating the strong presumption of legitimacy of agency actions, is not readily discerned. <span class="Italic">Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Johnson</span>, 8 F.3d 791 (Fed. Cir. 1993), also a decision written by Judge Mayer, involved government audits of purchases of airline tickets by government travelers and funds recouped by the government from airline carriers. The presumption of good faith, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, operated to prevent an audit process after the issuance of airline tickets from undermining the legitimacy of discretionary transactions leading to their issuance. The other case cited in <span class="Italic">White</span>, <span class="Italic">Staton v. United States</span>, 228 Ct. Cl. 797 (1981), was a pre-Reform Act case that affirmed the removal of a DEA criminal investigator who asserted a reprisal defense to his removal for unsatisfactory performance. Of the defense the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, there is no record evidence of bad faith on the part of plaintiff's superiors in the Dallas regional headquarters of DEA. There is nothing to indicate that the deputy regional director who issued the proposal to remove plaintiff was actuated by anything other than a dispassionate, objective appraisal of plaintiff's job performance. The same observation is equally apropos with respect to the regional director who made the decision to remove plaintiff. In sum, the record contains no evidence that plaintiff's removal, based on unsatisfactory performance, was in bad faith. The presumption that Government officials act in good faith stands unrebutted. <span class="Italic">See Preble v. United States</span>, 150 Ct. Cl. 39 (1960) (removal based on inefficiency upheld where there was substantial evidence of inefficiency and where employee failed to make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that retaliation was a reason for his removal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Preble v. United States</span>, 150 Ct. Cl. 39 (1960), cited in <span class="Italic">Staton</span>, said of a reprisal defense offered to a civilian dismissal case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The possibility of agency motives other than the efficiency of the service should not negate an otherwise legally consummated separation based on inefficiency. Moreover, at no point does plaintiff allege that the charges against him were unfounded. Nowhere does he claim that but for retaliation he would not have been separated. If a legally sound removal for cause exists it should not be invalidated because of a possible but unsupported taint. To hold otherwise would enable an inefficient civil servant to make his job more secure by engaging in activities calculated to invite reprisal by his supervisor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3699"></span>In a contract case making some references to civilian employment decisions, the Federal Circuit offered an extensive definition of the "clear and convincing" standard with direct reference to "irrefragable proof," <span class="Italic">Am-Pro Protective Agency, Inc. v. United States</span>, 281 F.3d 1234, 1239-40 (Fed. Cir. 2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presumption that government officials act in good faith is nothing new to our jurisprudence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Knotts v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 128 Ct. Cl. 489, 492, 121 F. Supp. 630 (1954) (stating "we start out with the presumption that the official acted in good faith"). Nor is the strength of this presumption, at least insofar as it arises in the context of quasi-criminal wrongdoing by government officials acting in the course of their public duties. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In fact, for almost 50 years this court and its predecessor have repeated that we are "loath to find to the contrary [of good faith], and it takes, and should take, well-nigh irrefragable proof to induce us to do so." <span class="Italic">Schaefer</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States,</span> 224 Ct. Cl. 541, 633 F.2d 945, 948-49 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also Grover v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 200 Ct. Cl. 337, 344 (1973); <span class="Italic">Kalvar</span>, 543 F.2d at 1302; <span class="Italic">Torncello v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 231 Ct. Cl. 20, 681 F.2d 756, 770 (1982); <span class="Italic">T &#x0026; M Distribs., Inc. v. United States,</span> 185 F.3d 1279, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While our court and its predecessor have often used the "well-nigh irrefragable" language to describe the quality of evidence required to overcome the good faith presumption, several cases instead use the phrase "clear evidence." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Librach</span>, 147 Ct. Cl. at 612 (stating that "clear evidence to the contrary" is necessary to overcome the presumption in favor of the government); <span class="Italic">George v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 166 Ct. Cl. 527, 531 (1964) (same). The use of two different but nevertheless similar descriptions of the evidence needed to overcome this presumption may have led to some confusion. So, in line with our well-established precedent that a high burden must be carried to overcome this presumption, we now consider what proof is needed to show that the government acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts generally recognize three standards of proof: preponderance of the evidence, clear and convincing, and beyond a reasonable doubt. <span class="Italic">See Price v. Symsek,</span> 988 F.2d 1187, 1191 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Of the three, we believe that clear and convincing most appropriately describes the burden of proof applicable to the presumption of the governments good faith. This is so because, for one, the presumption of good faith, as used here, applies only in the situation where a government official allegedly engaged in fraud or in some other quasi-criminal wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See Addington</span> <span class="Italic">v. Texas,</span> 441 U.S. 418, 423-24, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed.2d 323 (1979) (discussing the three burdens of proof outlined above and the situations in which they ordinarily apply). In addition, we believe the clear and convincing standard most closely approximates the language traditionally used to describe the burden for negating the good faith presumption; namely, the "well-nigh, irrefragable" proof standard. Specifically, we have described clear and convincing burden as such:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A requirement of proof by clear and convincing evidence imposes a heavier burden upon a litigant than that imposed by requiring proof by preponderant evidence but a somewhat lighter burden than that imposed by requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Clear and convincing evidence has been described as evidence which produces in the mind of the trier of fact an abiding conviction that the truth of a factual contention is <span class="Italic">"highly probable."</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Price,</span> 988 F.2d at 1191 (internal citations omitted) (determining the quantum of proof required to establish priority in an interference proceeding with an issued patent) (emphasis added). "Well-nigh irrefragable" proof similarly refers to evidence that "cannot be refuted or disproved; incontrovertible, incontestable, indisputable, irrefutable, undeniable (said of a statement, argument, etc., or the person who advances it.)" Oxford English Dictionary 93 (2d ed. 1991) (defining "irrefragable"). As with the clear and convincing standard, the requirement of "well-nigh irrefragable"' proof also sets a high hurdle for a challenger seeking to prove that a government official acted in bad faith:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the cases where the court has considered allegations of bad faith, the necessary "irrefragable proof' has been equated with evidence of some specific intent to injure the plaintiff. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. United States,</span> the court compared bad faith to actions which are "motivated alone by malice." In <span class="Italic">Knotts,</span> the court found bad faith in a civilian pay suit only in view of a proven "conspiracy...to get rid of plaintiff." Similarly, the court in <span class="Italic">Struck Constr. Co. v. United States,</span> found bad faith when confronted by a course of Governmental conduct which was "designedly oppressive." But in <span class="Italic">Librach,</span> the court found no bad faith because the officials involved were not "actuated by animus toward the plaintiff."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kalvar</span>, 543 F.2d at 1302 (internal citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Sanders v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Serv.,</span> 801 F.2d 1328, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (stating that "there is a <span class="Italic">strong presumption</span> in the law that administrative actions are correct and taken in good faith") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Caldwell &#x0026; Santmyer, Inc. v. Glickman</span>, 55 F.3d 1578, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (reiterating the principle that "[a] contractor can overcome [the presumption that the government acts in good faith] only if it shows through 'well nigh irrefragable proof that the government had a specific intent to injure it") (quoting <span class="Italic">Torncello v. United States</span>, 231 Ct. Cl. 20, 681 F.2d 756, 770 (1982)); <span class="Italic">Torncello</span>, 681 F.2d at 770 (stating "the government...is assumed always to act in good faith, subject only to an <span class="Italic">extremely difficult</span> showing by the plaintiff to the contrary.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Librach</span>, 147 Ct. Cl. at 612 (stating that "clear evidence to the contrary" is necessary to overcome the presumption in favor of the government).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this well-established precedent, it logically follows that showing a government official acted in bad faith is intended to be very difficult, and that something stronger than a "preponderance of evidence" is necessary to overcome the presumption that he acted in good faith, i.e., properly. This is especially so when, as in this case, years have passed between the occurrence of the underlying facts and the allegation of bad faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The irrefragable proof doctrine noted by the Federal Circuit was deemed <span class="Italic">dictum</span> by the Board in <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WHITE_JOHN_E_DE_1221_92_0491_M_4_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249120.pdf">95 MSPR 1</a>, 6-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-27 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 391 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Board announced that the presumed regularity of government operations or good faith of the government's operatives would be a factor in the analysis of whether an individual had a reasonable belief that a reported condition constituted gross mismanagement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The question here is what test do we use to determine if the appellant had a "reasonable belief" that he was disclosing "gross mismanagement." More specifically, did the appellant need to prove that he had a reasonable belief that the agency had engaged in gross mismanagement of the QES program under the long-standing "objective test" or under another standard?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the objective test for reasonable belief adopted by both the Board and the Federal Circuit, the appellant needed to prove by preponderant evidence that the matter he reported was one that a reasonable person in his position would have believed evidenced gross mismanagement<span class="Italic">. See D'Elia v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 540, 547 (1994);<span class="Italic"> Garst v. Department of the Army</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 514, 518 (1994) (citing<span class="Italic"> Haley v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 977 F.2d 553, 557 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). According to the agency and OPM, to prove that he had a reasonable belief, Mr. White would have had to do much more than prove by preponderant evidence that a reasonable person in his position would have believed that the agency was not properly managing the QES program. Rather, the agency and OPM would require the appellant to submit "irrefragable proof" to rebut a presumption that agency officials in charge of the QES program had properly managed the program. OPM's and the agency's arguments are based on a statement made by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">White IV</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the proper test for establishing a reasonable belief, the court in <span class="Italic">White IV</span> held as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We conclude, therefore, that the proper test is this: could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence gross mismanagement? A purely subjective perspective of an employee is not sufficient even if shared by other employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">174 F.3d at 1381. This is simply a reiteration of the "objective test." The court, however, in the next paragraph of its decision, made the following statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In this case, review of the Air Force's policy and implementation via the QES standards might well show them to be entirely appropriate, even if not the best option. Indeed, this review would start out with a "presumption that public officers perform their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law and governing regulations.... And this presumption stands unless there is 'irrefragable proof to the contrary.'" <span class="Italic">Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Johnson</span>, 8 F.3d 791, 795 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency and OPM rely on the last sentence in that quote to argue that the court altered the well-settled objective test for reasonable belief by requiring the appellant to provide "irrefragable proof" to rebut a presumption that agency managers acted properly and in good faith when supervising the QES program. For the following reasons, we disagree with OPM and the agency that the court in <span class="Italic">White IV</span> changed the well-settled "objective test."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, our analysis must begin with the statute. Nowhere in the WPA did Congress place a burden of proof on an appellant in an IRA appeal to provide "irrefragable" proof to rebut a presumption that, in the matter at issue, agency officials performed their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with law. This is in comparison to situations where Congress expressly establishes a presumption in the statute<span class="Italic">. See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co.</span>, 428 U.S. 1, 22, 96 S. Ct. 2882, 2895-96, 49 L. Ed. 2d 752 (1976) (interpreting a statute which expressly provides for an "irrebuttable presumption" of total disability for coal miners in <span id="Page_3700"></span>certain situations). In referring to the objective test for reasonable belief, the Board observed in <span class="Italic">Shively v. Department of the Army</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 531 (1993), that both the statutory language and the legislative history of the WPA indicate that "the reasonable belief test is the <span class="Italic">only</span> relevant inquiry in determining whether a particular disclosure is protected." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 537 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision in <span class="Italic">Shively</span> was issued in 1993. Congress amended the WPA in 1994. We are aware of nothing in the legislative history of the 1994 amendments to indicate that Congress believed that the Board in <span class="Italic">Shively</span> or any other such case had misinterpreted either the language of the WPA or congressional intent in setting forth the objective test for reasonable belief. Moreover, we are aware of no effort by any member of Congress during the enactment of the 1994 WPA amendments to revise the statute in order to address any perceived error in the Board's or the court's interpretation of "reasonable belief" as implicating only the objective test<span class="Italic">. See generally Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 783 n.15, 105 S. Ct. 1620, 1629 n.15, 84 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1985) ("Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further observe that the dictionary definition of "irrefragable" is "impossible to gainsay, deny, or refute"; "impossible to break or alter"; "inviolable, indestructible." Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1993 ed.). Thus, to accept OPM's and the agency's interpretation of <span class="Italic">White IV</span>'s use of the term "irrefragable proof" would impose what amounts to a virtually impossible evidentiary burden on whistleblowers to prove that agencies in fact engaged in gross mismanagement. We located nothing in either the language of the WPA or its legislative history that even remotely suggests a congressional intent to impose such a standard under the WPA. Rather, the clear language of the statute requires only that an employee have a "reasonable belief" of gross mismanagement in order to make a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">White IV</span> in May 1999, yet it has never again, to our knowledge, applied the "irrefragable proof" burden of proof in an IRA appeal. On the contrary, the court in post-<span class="Italic">White IV</span> cases has used the traditional objective, "disinterested observer" test. In discussing the following three court opinions, we note that two of them are unpublished and therefore not citable as precedent under the rules of the court. We are, however, not citing them as precedent, but merely as an historical account of how the court has applied <span class="Italic">White IV</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chianelli v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 8 Fed. Appx. 971 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (nonpublished), the appellant claimed he had disclosed gross mismanagement. The Board's final decision denied corrective action<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 976-77. In affirming the Board, the court quoted only the paragraph in <span class="Italic">White IV</span> dealing with the objective test<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 978. In doing so, it stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999), this court set forth <span class="Italic">the</span> standard to determine the reasonableness of a putative whistleblower's belief in the protected nature of his disclosures: [t]he <span class="Italic">proper test</span> is this: could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence gross mismanagement? <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381. We further emphasized in <span class="Italic">Lachance</span> that this standard is an <span class="Italic">objective</span> one: 'A purely subjective perspective of an employee is not sufficient even if shared by other employees.' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In other words, the question here is not whether Mr. Chianelli believed that his disclosures were protected under the WPA because they evidenced instances of gross mismanagement or misconduct by agency employees. Rather, the question is whether an objectively reasonable person with full knowledge of the essential facts would have believed those disclosures to be protected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 978 [Emphasis added.] In setting forth the standard for assessing reasonable belief where gross mismanagement was the alleged disclosure, the court in <span class="Italic">Chianelli</span> made no mention of a presumption that is rebuttable only by irrefragable proof. Instead, it stated that the objective, reasonable person test was "the" standard and the "proper test." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeal in <span class="Italic">Ferro v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 10 Fed. Appx. 843 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (nonpublished), involved a Special Counsel action based on claimed retaliation for whistleblowing. The court cited <span class="Italic">White IV</span> and applied the objective test to determine whether Ms. Aikens, the whistleblower, had a reasonable belief that she was making a protected disclosure when she reported that one of the alleged retaliators, Mr. Ferro, had violated a law by misusing a government-owned vehicle (GOV)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 846. Citing <span class="Italic">White IV</span>, the court stated that "[t]he test is <span class="Italic">not</span> whether there was <span class="Italic">in fact</span> a violation, but whether a disinterested observer could reasonably conclude that a violation occurred." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court agreed with the Board that, under an objective test, Ms. Aikens reasonably believed that the vehicle had been misused, even though it was later determined that she had misread the mileage on Ferro's GOV<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In finding that Aikens made a protected disclosure, the court did not apply a presumption that Ferro had operated his GOV according to the law and in good faith, let alone say anything about the Special Counsel having to rebut such a presumption by irrefragable proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a precedential decision in <span class="Italic">Giove v. Department of Transportation</span>, 230 F.3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000), the court reviewed an arbitrator's award. The Federal Circuit cited <span class="Italic">White IV</span> and found that the arbitrator, although not explicitly referring to an objective test, nonetheless reviewed the evidence under an objective standard of what a "disinterested observer" would have believed<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1338. The court, as it later did in <span class="Italic">Chianelli</span>, called the objective test the "proper test" for ascertaining reasonable belief<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Under that test, the court found that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known by the appellant could not have reasonably believed that there was a cover-up or that an agency manager committed misconduct by allegedly destroying or concealing evidence relating to an airplane crash<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1339. The court said nothing about a requirement that the appellant had to rebut a presumption of correctness and good faith on the part of the manager by irrefragable proof, or even that such a burden was part of the "proper test." These three Federal Circuit cases strongly indicate that the court does not consider the rebuttal of a presumption of good faith by irrefragable proof to be part of the <span class="Italic">White IV</span> standard for determining reasonable belief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the WPA clearly does not place a burden on an appellant to submit "irrefragable proof" to rebut a presumption that federal officials act in good faith and in accordance with law. There is no suggestion in the legislative history of the WPA that Congress intended such a burden be placed on an appellant. When Congress amended the WPA in 1994, it did nothing to indicate that the objective test, which had been articulated by the Board by that time, was inconsistent with the statute. The dictionary definition of "irrefragable" suggests that a putative whistleblower would literally have to show that the agency actually engaged in gross mismanagement, even though the WPA states that he need only have a reasonable belief as to that matter. The Federal Circuit itself has not imposed an "irrefragable proof" burden on appellants in cases decided after <span class="Italic">White IV</span> and has, in fact, stated that the "proper test" is the objective, "disinterested observer" standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the objective test contemplates, the Board can presume that "public officers perform their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law and governing regulations," which is the portion of <span class="Italic">Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Johnson</span> quoted by the court in <span class="Italic">White IV</span>. That presumption is merely one consideration in deciding whether a reasonable person in the appellant's situation could have believed that the agency engaged in gross mismanagement. For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the part of the quote from <span class="Italic">Alaska Airlines</span> dealing with a rebuttal of that presumption by irrefragable proof has to be <span class="Italic">dictum</span> which was simply added to the end of the quotation from <span class="Italic">Alaska Airlines</span>, a case which had nothing to do with the WPA or the case law that had developed on the objective test for reasonable belief under that statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we will apply the long-standing and well-settled objective test in determining whether Mr. White proved by preponderant evidence that he had a reasonable belief that Air Force officials has grossly mismanaged the QES program when he criticized the QES standards during meetings on May 4, and May 5, 1992<span class="Italic">. White IV</span>, 174 F.3d at 1380. As discussed below, we find that, under the objective test, the appellant did not meet his burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without binding itself to the presumed presence or absence of good faith, the D.C. Circuit weighed in with its own analysis of the burden of proof in a pre-WPA corrective action case, <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The court acknowledged a presumption of regularity of government proceedings and, with that recognition, placed the burden on the appellant to prove reprisal without establishing a particular burden of proof:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Burden of Proof</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners next contend that the Board erred in requiring the Special Counsel to prove the existence of prohibited personnel practices by the preponderance of the evidence. Asserting that the Board must at least give the determinations of the Special Counsel "great deference," the deputies argue that the filing of a corrective action petition makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case which the charged agency must rebut by clear and convincing evidence. Respondents counter that the Board's allocation of the burden of proof is supported by other provisions of the Act and by the case law in analogous areas.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As section 1206 is silent on the question of which party bears the burden of proof, we must sustain the Board's choice if it is consistent with the statutory scheme and reasonable. <span class="Italic">See FCC v. Schreiber</span>, 381 U.S. 279, 290-94, 85 S. Ct. 1459, 1467-69, 14 L. Ed.2d 383 (1965). We believe the Board's analysis satisfies these criteria. In Chapter 77 appeals, an agency seeking to take a challenged personnel action bears the burden of showing that its decision is justified by concerns for the efficiency of the civil service. <span class="Italic">See</span> section 7701(c)(1). Yet the employee, and not the <span id="Page_3701"></span>agency, apparently bears the burden of proving allegations of prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> section 7701(c) (2)(B).[53] These provisions may reflect a congressional assumption that agency reprisals are relatively exceptional[54] and that official regularity in this regard should be presumed. <span class="Italic">See Mazaleski v. Treusdell</span>, 562 F.2d 701, 717 n.38 (D.C. Cir. 1977). The Board could reasonably conclude that, especially in light of the prosecutorial nature of the proceeding, <span class="Italic">see</span> p. 162 <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the same principle should apply in a corrective action case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[53]&#x2003;Paragraph (1) of section 7701(c) requires the Board to sustain agency actions "only if" they are supported by substantial evidence in some cases and the preponderance of the evidence in others. Paragraph (2), however, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the agency's decision may not be sustained...<span class="Italic">if the employee or applicant for employment</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;shows that the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice.... (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[54]&#x2003;As the Board noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The protection of whistleblowers is a primary purpose of the Act. At the same time, the restrictions on managerial abuses and protection of employees established by Title I must be construed in light of the Act's legislative history, which reveals a complementary, but some(e)times countervailing, purpose to improve the efficiency of the civil service by facilitating removal of the employees who fail to perform their duties. Thus an employee's claim to be a whistleblower must be carefully scrutinized to insure that whistleblowing protection is not being misused in an attempt to thwart needed disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1 MSPB at 159 n.1.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Requiring the Special Counsel to demonstrate that an agency's action was improperly based on retaliatory motives is also consistent with the rule in other employment contexts.

FCC</span>, 5 MSPR 113, 117-18, 5 MSPB 181 (1981), accepting in its stead the "significant factor" test (later revised by the Whistleblower Protection Act), to be met by the appellant's preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 628, 641 (1996), resolved that the appellant need not prove animus because of his disclosures. It is the agency's responsibility to prove by clear and convincing evidence that its actions were justified. But the "irrefragable proof" standard was reinjected into Board litigation by <span class="Italic">Pulcini v. SSA</span>, 83 MSPR 685, 691 &#x00B6; 11 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As directed by our reviewing court, the Board's review starts out with a "'presumption that public officers perform their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law and governing regulations,'" and "'this presumption stands unless there is 'irrefragable proof to the contrary.'" <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Johnson</span>, 8 F.3d 791, 795 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). For the reasons below, we find that the appellant adduced no nonfrivolous allegations of fact to rebut this presumption with respect to the whistleblowing claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 166, 172-73 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 13 (2002) (obliquely noting the presumption of good faith, but not discussing the standard in a straightforward way).</p>
