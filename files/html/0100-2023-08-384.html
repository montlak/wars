<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-376"><span class="space">a.</span> Passover</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3318, establishing the passover process, is reprinted in the earlier section "Basis for Veterans Preference." The OPM passover regulation, 5 CFR 332.406 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Objections to eligibles</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Delegated authority</span>. Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, OPM has delegated to agencies the authority to adjudicate objections to eligibles, including pass over requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;OPM retains exclusive authority to approve the sufficiency of an agency's request to pass over preference eligibles who are thirty percent (30%) or more compensably disabled. Such persons have the right, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3318, to respond to the pass over request before OPM makes a final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;OPM also retains the exclusive authority to approve the sufficiency of an agency's reasons to medically disqualify or medically pass over a preference eligible or disabled veteran in certain circumstances, in accordance with part 339 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An agency must refer any objection (including a pass over request) that is based on material, intentional false statement or <span id="Page_738"></span>deception or fraud in examination or appointment to OPM for a suitability action where warranted, under part 731 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard for objections</span>. An agency is not required to consider an individual for a position when an objection to (including a request to pass over) the particular individual is sustained or granted. An objection, including a pass over request, may be sustained only if it is based on a proper and adequate reason. The reasons set forth for disqualification by OPM in part 339 of this chapter constitute proper and adequate reasons to sustain an objection. Similarly, the criteria for making suitability determinations in part 731 of this chapter constitute proper and adequate reasons to sustain an objection. In addition, reasons published <span id="Page_739"></span>by OPM in the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook constitute proper and adequate reasons to sustain an objection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sufficiency of the reasons for a pass over</span>. Subject to the exception set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, an agency may not pass over a preference eligible to select a non-preference eligible unless OPM or an agency with delegated authority also makes a determination that the sufficiency of the reasons is supported by the evidence submitted for the pass over request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency's obligation while request for objection is pending</span>. Subject to the exception set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, if an agency makes an objection against an applicant for a position (including seeking to pass over the applicant), and the individual that the agency wishes to select would be within reach of selection only if the objection is sustained, or the pass over granted, that agency may not make a selection for the position until a final ruling is made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applicability of paragraphs (c) and (d).</span> Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply if the agency has more than one position to fill from the same certificate and holds open (in the event the objection is not sustained or the pass over request is denied) a position that could be filled by the individual against whom an objection or a pass over request has been filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedures for objections and pass overs.</span> Agencies must follow the procedures for objecting to or requesting to pass over an eligible that are published by OPM in the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">No appeal rights to Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</span> An individual may not appeal to the MSPB a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority to sustain an objection pursuant to this part, including a decision to grant a pass over request, irrespective of the reason for the decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to the OPM Delegated Examining Operations Handbook (2019) <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>, Chapter 6, Section D--Objections and Pass-Overs.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM Delegated Examining Operations Handbook explains the relation of the passover process and the category rating system, earlier discussed:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result of his disabilities stemming from his service in the Marine Corps, Mr. Abell is a preference eligible veteran entitled to preference eligible points under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309. Preference eligible veterans include veterans of service in the armed forces, or relatives thereof, who satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108. By statute, a preference eligible veteran, who receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive civil service, is entitled to five or ten additional points above his or her earned rating. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309. Because Mr. Abell is a disabled veteran under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(C), he is eligible for ten additional points under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309(1).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A non-preference eligible applicant may only be selected over a preference eligible candidate under certain circumstances. Congress created a procedure for appointing authorities to use when seeking to pass over a preference eligible candidate in order to fill a vacancy with an individual who is not a preference eligible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b). The procedure requires the appointing authority to send a request to OPM, along with a statement of the reasons for the request to pass over the preference eligible candidate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Navy prepared a request to pass over Mr. Abell in favor of Mr. Green, stating reasons for the request. However, it never submitted the request to OPM for review. Instead, it asked Management Analyst Marsha Arrington to determine whether the request to pass over would be sustainable based on the justifications given by the Navy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1), an appointing authority may pass over a preference eligible candidate in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). The procedure for doing so requires the appointing authority to send a statement of reasons for the request to pass over to OPM, which reviews the reasons in order to make a determination of whether to grant the authority to the agency to pass over.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the case of a preference eligible described in section 2108(3)(C) of this title who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, the appointing authority shall at the same time it notifies the Office under paragraph (1) of this subsection, notify the preference eligible of the proposed Passover....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2).

Mr. Abell argues that the Navy had a statutory duty to inform him of its request to pass him over for Mr. Green, to state its reasons for the request, and to give him an opportunity to respond to the request. The Navy responds that, since it never actually submitted to OPM a request to pass over Mr. Abell, it never incurred the duty to notify Mr. Abell and to allow him the opportunity to respond. The evidence supports the Board's conclusion that the Navy did not request passover authority from OPM. Ms. Arrington testified that only a ten-point veteran must be notified and only if the request goes to OPM for review. In this case, Ms. Arrington testified that the request was never actually submitted to OPM. The Navy instead chose to cancel the vacancy rather than pass over a preference eligible. The Navy did not violate Mr. Abell's rights under the VEOA because it was not required to inform him of its efforts to pass him over.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Passovers involve application of veterans preference to the process of selecting an applicant for a job. An agency would seek to pass over a qualified applicant in favor of an applicant with lower, or no, veterans preference, on a certificate of eligibles based on specific shortcomings in the applicant's qualifications. Passover criteria include medical qualifications and suitability criteria. In addition to their significance in VEOA nonselection cases, passovers are challenged in employment practice changes, subsequently discussed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-3330-16-0292-B-1 (NP 8/25/2022), determined that no passover violation occurred when the agency used a name-request selection process under the DOD expedited hiring authority process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e agree with the administrative judge that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it appointed nonpreference eligibles to the Contract Specialist positions under the EHA program through the name request method. Under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f), for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304 and other statutes not implicated here, the Secretary of Defense may "designate any category of positions in the acquisition workforce as positions for which there exists a shortage of candidates or there is a critical hiring need," and he may use the authorities in such sections to recruit and make direct hires. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f)(1)-(2). Section 3304(a)(3) of title 5, in turn, provides authority for agencies to hire candidates "without regard to the provision of sections 3309 through 3318" for positions for which public notice has been given and for which the Office of Personnel Management has determined "that there exists a severe shortage of candidates...or that there is a critical hiring need." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3). Considering these statutes together, we find that appointments under the EHA name request method may be made without regard to veterans' preference, including the pass-over procedures under section 3318. <span class="Italic">See Isabella v. Department of State</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 12 (2008) (noting that "[t]he Supreme Court has instructed that when courts are confronted with statutes capable of coexistence, it is the duty of courts to regard each as effective "). Therefore, the agency was not obligated to comply with the pass-over provisions under section 3318 when it filled the Contract Specialist positions, and the appellant has failed to prove a violation of his veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That OPM denies a passover request does not preclude or estop the agency from requiring, as a condition to appointment, that the appellant provide <span id="Page_740"></span>evidence of his qualifications, <span class="Italic">Goodin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 123 MSPR 316, 320-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2016 MSPB 18 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, OPM found that the agency could not pass over the appellant. However, OPM's passover decision did not relieve the agency from requiring the appellant to provide the mandated documentation for the credentialing process pursuant to Army regulations because, as set forth in the vacancy announcement, it was a requirement imposed on all selectees for the GS-12 Clinical Social Worker position. The record reflects that, after it received the certificate of applicants eligible for the position at issue, the agency instructed the appellant to provide the necessary credentialing documents, but he did not provide all of the required documents. After OPM denied the agency's passover request, the agency resumed the on-boarding process for the appellant and asked him to provide the credentialing documents he had not submitted previously. The appellant admitted during discovery that he did not provide the required documents. Instead, he wrote the agency asserting that, because OPM denied the agency's passover request, he is entitled to an exception to the agency's usual preappointment process for the Clinical Social Worker position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having met its obligation to offer the appellant in this matter the Clinical Social Worker position that he sought, we discern no reason that the agency may not subject him to the same preappointment process as other employees. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly found that, by giving the appellant his 10-point preference, which placed him ahead of all other candidates on the highly qualified list, and offering him the GS-12 Clinical Worker position, the agency afforded him his veterans' preference rights. Further, by applying the generally applicable preappointment process, the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Gingery v. Department of Defense,</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 8 (2014) (finding, in a compliance proceeding following a VEOA corrective action order, that the agency may require a successful VEOA litigant to undergo the same preappointment security clearance process as all other individuals); <span class="Italic">Dow v.

When the appellant was unwilling or unable to provide the required documentation for the credentialing process pursuant to Army regulations, the agency could withdraw the tentative offer of employment without again requesting passover authority from OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fedder v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 103 MSPR 221, 224-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14, 2006 MSPB 262 (2006), a VEOA appeal, considered alleged passover procedures violations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on petition for review that the administrative judge failed to address certain allegations and arguments he presented below in connection with his VEOA claim. We agree, and we have granted the petition in order to correct this omission. As explained below, however, we see nothing in those allegations and arguments that affects the outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the appellant argues that the agency violated his rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 by failing to provide him with advance notice of the reasons for the selecting official's proposal to pass over him, and by failing to provide him with an opportunity to respond to those reasons before Ms. Harper approved the proposed action. Paragraph (b)(2) of section 3318 does provide such rights in "the case of a preference eligible...who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more...." <span class="Italic">See Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 7 (2001). The appellant, however, was receiving compensation for a disability or disabilities "rated...less than 30 percent" at the time of his nonselection. Moreover, the language in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1) and (b)(3) on which the appellant relies does not support the appellant's argument that other preference eligibles are entitled to the same procedures. While paragraph (b)(1) requires OPM (or the agency with delegated authority) to consider "any response received from the preference eligible under paragraph (2) of this section" in ruling on a pass-over request, it does not provide that a preference eligible receiving compensation for disabilities rated less than 30 percent must be given an opportunity to submit such a response. The reference in that paragraph to "any response" therefore appears to apply to a response received from a preference eligible with a disability rated 30 percent or more. Furthermore, while paragraph (b)(3) provides that preference eligibles not described in paragraph (b)(2) are "entitled, on request, to a copy of" the pass-over proposal and the ruling on that proposal, it neither requires that the copies be provided in advance of the ruling nor refers to any right to respond to the proposal before the ruling is made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that the agency has failed to establish that authority to approve the pass-over request was delegated to the Bureau of Reclamation or specifically to Ms. Harper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has submitted a copy of a September 2000 agreement to delegate examining authority to the Department of the Interior. Moreover, the agreement specifically provides that the Department of the Interior is responsible for "[i]ssu[ing] certificates of eligibles...and establish[ing] objection/passover procedures"; and, although it provides that OPM is to "retain final approval authority" over certain categories of "[o]bjections/passovers," those categories do not include any that are relevant to this case. As the appellant appears to acknowledge, this evidence is sufficient to establish that OPM delegated to the Department of the Interior the authority to approve requests to pass over preference eligibles on a certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see nothing in the agreement that limits the agency's ability to determine which of its organizations and officials are to carry out the delegated authority in question. Moreover, excerpts from OPM's "Delegated Examining Operations Handbook" that the agency has submitted include a statement that agencies to whom examining authority is delegated "may assign examining responsibilities to subordinate offices, which serve as 'delegated examining offices' (DEOs)." The pass-over proposal at issue in this case was addressed to such an office, as indicated above, and nothing in the record suggests that Ms. Harper--an individual the appellant describes as "the Agency's Human Resources Officer"--was not the appropriate official in the DEO to approve the proposed action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, and in the absence of any showing that the agency otherwise violated the appellant's rights as a preference eligible, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has not shown that he is entitled to any relief under VEOA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reviewing court determined that the Board properly concluded an agency did not violate its delegated authority to pass over an individual with veterans preference, <span class="Italic">Pecard v. USDA</span>, 495 Fed. Appx. 90, 93 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Pecard claims that the agency's pass over request with regard to three other positions was invalidly sustained, and thus violated his VEOA rights. A hiring agency which objects to a preference eligible candidate for a "proper and adequate reason," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a), including false statements or fraud, may request Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") authorization to exclude or "pass over" the preference eligible applicant in favor of a non-preference eligible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406(a)(3), (b). Generally, unsuccessful applicants like Pecard "may not appeal to the MSPB a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority...to grant a pass over request, irrespective of the reason for the decision." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406(g). However, Pecard is arguing that the agency lacked delegated authority to act on the pass over request in question. He points out that the regulation only bars review when the pass over is granted by OPM or an agency with "delegated authority," and argues that in this case, the agency did not have delegated authority because "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 requires that [a pass over] be sustained by [OPM itself] in order to be compliant with the statute and VEOA." Surprisingly, the agency did not respond to this jurisdictional argument in its briefs. We agree with Pecard that review of the alleged absence of delegated authority is not an issue foreclosed by &#x00A7; 332.406(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the Board concluded that OPM's regulation properly delegated authority to the agency to act on the pass over request, and we agree. Section 3318(b)(4) bars delegation of OPM's pass over authority only with regard to applicants "ha[ving] a compensable service connected disability of 30 percent or more." &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2). This limitation was relevant in <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2008), but does not govern this case because Pecard has not demonstrated that he is a qualified 30 percent disabled veteran. Section 3318 does not otherwise bar delegation, nor suggest that the delegation here is in any way impermissible. Section 332.406, the regulation that explicitly delegated authority to the agency to act on the pass over request, took effect prior to the request affecting Pecard. <span class="Italic">See</span> 73 Fed. Reg. at 20,149. In sum, Pecard has not demonstrated that the agency acted without authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency properly reconstructed an action and, under delegated authority, properly sustained a passover objection to the appellant's appointment without a VEOA violation, <span class="Italic">Schoenrogge v. DOJ,</span> DA-3330-09-0467-C-1 (NP 4/20/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency submitted an affidavit from Human Resources Specialist Bridgette Hill in which she avers that she reconstructed the hiring process on or about March 3, 2010, and after crediting the appellant for his prior experience and preference points, found that he occupied the first position on the list with the highest score. The record also indicates that, on March 3, 2010, after reconstructing the certificate of eligibles that included the appellant as first on the list, the agency requested and received permission from its Justice Management Division to pass over the appellant as a preference eligible "based on his removal from the agency and the fact that he has not been rehabilitated nor shown remorse for his actions." The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) recently promulgated a regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406, which became <span id="Page_741"></span>effective July 27, 2009, that delegates to agencies the authority to adjudicate objections to eligibles, including pass-over requests, except under circumstances that are not applicable here. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406(a). Because the agency had delegated authority, it properly adjudicated the instant pass-over request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments on review concern the merits of the agency's pass-over request. OPM's regulations expressly provide, however, that "[a]n individual may not appeal to the MSPB a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority to sustain an objection pursuant to this part, including a decision to grant a pass over request, irrespective of the reason for the decision." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406(g). Moreover, the Board has previously recognized that neither the statute providing for pass-over authority, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, nor OPM's regulations implementing that authority, provide for a right of appeal to the Board from an OPM pass-over decision. <span class="Italic">Lodge</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 11 n.3. Thus, the Board has no authority to consider the appellant's contentions concerning the basis for the agency's pass-over determination.</p>

Jarrard ("Jarrard") petitions for review of two decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") denying his request for corrective action under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 ("VEOA"). <span class="Italic">See Jarrard v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jarrard is a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at eighty percent, which makes him a "preference eligible" veteran under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(C). He applied for attorney positions at the Social Security Administration ("SSA") in 2009 and at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington ("DOJ") in 2009 or 2010, informing both agencies that he was a preference eligible veteran. Both agencies selected other applicants, at least one of whom was a non-preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jarrard filed complaints with the Department of Labor under VEOA, which allows preference eligible veterans to challenge an agency's application of the veterans' preference requirements. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A). Jarrard complained that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320[1] required that the agencies follow the veterans' passover provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 in excepted service attorney hiring. Section 3318, which in terms applies only to the competitive service, requires agencies to "file written reasons" and to receive permission from the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") if they "pass over a preference eligible" who is among "the highest three eligibles available for appointment" on a certificate furnished by OPM under section 3317(a). There is no dispute that these procedures were not followed by SSA and DOJ in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 3320 provides that agencies "shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service in the executive branch...from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of this title."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA concluded that section 3320 did not require the application of section 3318 to attorney positions because those positions are exempt from passover procedures under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), and that Jarrard's preference eligible status was appropriately considered as only a "positive factor." The DOJ similarly stated that "Mr. Jarrard was not the most qualified person for the position, considering all factors, including veterans' preference eligibility." After the Department of Labor found no violation, Jarrard appealed both decisions to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An initial administrative judge decision on Jarrard's claim against the SSA agreed with the SSA that section 3320 did not require the application of section 3318 to attorney positions and dismissed the appeal for failure to state a claim. <span class="Italic">Jarrard v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, No. SF-3330-10-0024-I-1, (Feb. 1, 2010). The full Board vacated this decision and denied Jarrard's SSA appeal on the merits. <span class="Italic">Board SSA Decision</span>, 2010 M.S.P.B. 207, &#x00B6; 1. The Board agreed with the SSA that attorneys are exempt from any examination or rating requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 19. The Board stated that section 3320 did not require application of the 3318 passover procedures because "application of section 3318 is conditioned on the preference eligible being 'on a certificate.'" <span class="Italic">Board SSA Decision</span>, 2010 M.S.P.B. 207, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial administrative judge decision on Jarrard's appeal against the DOJ was issued the following week, and it followed the full Board decision in the SSA appeal and denied Jarrard's claim on the merits.

We review legal questions <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal agencies generally hire employees through either the "competitive service," which generally has specific hiring requirements and examinations, or the "excepted service," which involves more flexible hiring procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102-2103, 3301-3305, 3307-3308; <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2008). This case involves attorney hiring for the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(d) (placing attorneys within the excepted service). Within the excepted service, OPM has exempted certain positions from the normal appointments process, including attorney positions, and confidential or policy-making positions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When agencies hire for the competitive service, the Veterans Preference Act ("VPA") requires them to give advantages to certain veterans and their families, who are referred to as "preference eligibles." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3) (defining "preference eligible"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318 (describing advantages in competitive service hiring). As a general matter, these veterans' preference procedures also apply to hiring in the excepted service through 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, which provides that the excepted service shall be filled "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318." The legislative history of section 3320 sheds little light on the meaning of this provision.[2] Within the excepted service category, certain positions (including attorney positions) are further exempted from the usual appointment procedures by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), but these regulations require veterans' preference to be followed "as far as administratively feasible." As we confirmed in <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2005), where positions are entirely exempt from the usual appointment process, it is more likely that the detailed requirements of the VPA will prove to be infeasible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The revision notes in the U.S. Code from this section's 1966 enactment state that it "continues, and does not in any way change, the requirements in former section 858 relative to the selection of applicants for positions in the excepted service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 (2006) revision notes; <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. L. No. 89-554, &#x00A7; 3320, 80 Stat. 378, 422 (1966). Former section 858, which was enacted with the VPA in 1944, stated that "[i]n the unclassified...civil service...[the] appointing officer...shall make selection from the qualified applicants in accordance with the provisions of this chapter." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 858 (1964); <span class="Italic">see</span> VPA, Pub. L. No. 78-359, &#x00A7; 9, 58 Stat. 387, 389-90 (1944). The 1944 Senate committee report simply stated that this section "provides for the application of the provisions of the act to positions and employment in the unclassified service." S. Rep. No. 78-907, at 3 (1944).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In two prior cases we have considered the meaning of section 3320, and we have essentially construed that provision as requiring that VPA procedures be applied to excepted service hiring to the extent that it is administratively feasible to do so. That is, we adopted the same construction of section 3320 that OPM adopted in its regulations with respect to attorneys and other positions exempt from the usual appointment procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c) (stating that for exempted positions, "each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, the veteran applicant for an attorney position challenged the agency's failure to apply section 3309, which requires "[a]preference eligible who receives a passing grade in an examination" to receive "additional points above his earned rating." 424 F.3d at 1154 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309). We determined that "Congress has not spoken on the issue of how to apply the principles of veterans' preference to positions within the excepted service that are not subject to examination," and that OPM's regulations are thus entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1158-59. We concluded that OPM's exemption of attorneys from excepted service veterans' preference hiring procedures at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) is "reasonable and consistent with the VPA" because "agencies do not use numerical scores in assessing applicants for [attorney] positions." 424 F.3d at 1159. Instead, OPM agreed that the agency "must consider veteran status as a 'positive factor' in reviewing applications," which we found to "represent[ ] a reasonable balance between the goals of the VPA and the flexible hiring standards employed by the excepted service for filling attorney vacancies." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_742"></span>In <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, the preference-eligible veteran was applying for an auditor position within the Federal Career Intern Program ("FCIP"), and he challenged the agency's failure to apply section 3318 pursuant to section 3320. 550 F.3d at 1350. FCIP auditors are in the excepted service, but unlike attorneys, they are not exempted from OPM's hiring requirements for the excepted service under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101 and are selected from certificates. <span class="Italic">See</span> 550 F.3d at 1350. The agency applied OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b), which required an agency passing over a preference-eligible candidate only to "record its reasons" and "furnish a copy" to the candidate if requested. 550 F.3d at 1350. We held this regulation invalid as inconsistent with the more stringent requirements of section 3318. 550 F.3d at 1354. We noted that unlike section 3309, at issue in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, which required an examination, section 3318 did not. While section 3318 required hiring from a certificate, the auditor position was filled from a certificate, so nothing "would preclude application of &#x00A7; 3318 to the excepted service under &#x00A7; 3320." 550 F.3d at 1353.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case presents the question whether it is administratively feasible to apply the provisions of section 3318 to attorney hiring in the excepted service. The government contends that it is not feasible because federal statutes bar agencies from rating attorneys in government hiring. We first consider the statutes governing attorney hiring, and then consider whether the existence of these provisions renders impractical the application of the 3318 passover procedures to attorney hiring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For many years, the procedures for government attorney hiring have been limited by federal statute. The background of this provision is important in understanding its scope. In 1939, President Roosevelt appointed a committee to make recommendations on how civil service procedures should apply to attorneys. Exec. Order No. 8044, 4 Fed. Reg. 497 (Jan. 31, 1939). The committee disagreed on the best approach. A few members proposed "Plan B," under which attorney applicants would be ranked based on the results of an examination, like other civil service applicants. <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans Preference Act (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2108, 3309-3320)--Hiring Procedures for Attorneys--Excepted Service--Preference Hiring of Eligible Veterans, 3 Op. O.L.C. 140, 143 (1979) ("1979 OLC Memo") (citing H.R. Doc. No. 77-118 (1941)). Roosevelt instead selected "Plan A," which did not involve numerical rankings, and in 1941 he created the Board of Legal Examiners within the Civil Service Commission (the predecessor to OPM) to develop examinations for attorney applicants and "a register or registers of eligibles from which attorney positions in the classified service shall be filled." Exec. Order No. 8743, 6 Fed. Reg. 2117, 2117 (Apr. 23, 1941), <span class="Italic">reprinted as amended in</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301 notes. Congress was dissatisfied with the concept, and the Board of Legal Examiners was short-lived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress first refused appropriations to the Board of Legal Examiners in the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1944, stating that "no part of any appropriation in this Act shall be available for the salaries and expenses of the Board of Legal Examiners." Pub. L. No. 78-90, 57 Stat. 169, 173 (1943). Nearly identical restrictions have continued to this day. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-117, &#x00A7; 516, 123 Stat. 3034, 3195 (2009) ("[N]o part of this appropriation shall be available for salaries and expenses of the Legal Examining Unit of the Office of Personnel Management...or any successor unit of like purpose...."); Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, Pub. L. No. 111-242, &#x00A7; 101, 124 Stat. 2607, 2607 (2010) (continuing the appropriations of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, unless "otherwise specifically provided for," and making no separate appropriation for OPM or attorney hiring). The Senate floor debate on the 1944 appropriations restriction made clear that the purpose of this amendment was to "prohibit[ ] from now on any civil-service examination of lawyers" because "the idea of the Civil Service Commission reporting on lawyers and their ability and fairness and their relative qualifications...is something that cannot be done." 90 Cong. Rec. 2659-60 (1944). This restriction was passed despite its effects on the veterans' preference requirements; indeed, Senator Burton opposed the bill specifically because it would "mak[e] impossible the application to [lawyers] of the veterans' preference provisions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2661.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1977, the Civil Service Commission determined that the DOJ's attorney hiring did not satisfy the VPA's requirements and proposed that a "numerical rating system" be used for attorney hiring. <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans Preference Act (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2108, 3309-3320)--Application to Attorney Positions, 2 Op. O.L.C. 179, 179 (1978). The Office of Legal Counsel ("OLC") wrote a memorandum in 1978 to the Assistant Attorney General to explain why "the Commission does not have such authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The memorandum noted that "[t]he Commission's proposed rating system constitutes an attorney selection procedure because attorneys would be selected on the basis of their ratings." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 181. In 1979, OLC wrote a more detailed memorandum to explain the relevant history to OPM (which had been created from the Civil Service Commission in 1978). 1979 OLC Memo. The OLC noted that the shortlived Board of Legal Examiners examined attorneys and reported "descriptive ratings" (such as "Excellent" or "Good") on the register from which attorney positions had to be filled, but that even the Board of Legal Examiners eschewed numerical rankings on the register. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 144. Congress clearly rejected any assessment of the "relative qualifications" of lawyers in its appropriations restrictions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 145. Thus, as OLC concluded, "OPM is barred by its appropriation legislation from imposing a rating or other examination system on the hiring of attorneys within the executive branch." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 140. While we are not bound by the OLC interpretation of the statute, we think it is correct and adopt it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This leads to the second question: whether a bar on attorney examinations and ratings makes it not administratively feasible to apply the passover provisions of section 3318 to attorney hiring. OPM, which is charged with implementing the provisions of section 3320 by virtue of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(c).[3] has concluded that the passover provisions cannot be applied to attorney hiring. Shortly after the OLC concluded that OPM was barred from rating or examining attorneys, OPM issued this final rule to amend 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Department of Justice has now ruled that the statutory restriction [in the appropriations acts] also prohibits [OPM] from prescribing use of a numerical rating system in the selection of attorneys. To implement this ruling, the regulations governing employment in the excepted service are amended to exempt attorney positions from the procedural requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employment in the Excepted Service, 44 Fed. Reg. 66,573, 66,573 (Nov. 20, 1979). Thus, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) lists "[a]ttorney positions" as a class of "[p]ositions exempt from appointment procedures" for the excepted service, for which agencies only need to "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Section 1302(c) provides: "The Office [of Personnel Management] shall prescribe regulations for the administration of the provisions of this title that implement the Congressional policy that preference shall be given to preference eligibles in certification for appointment, and in appointment...in the excepted service in Executive agencies...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A bar on examinations alone would not make application of the passover provisions impractical: although in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> we held that examinations were a necessary predicate with respect to the section 3309 procedures, 424 F.3d at 1158, we reached a different result in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> with respect to section 3318, 550 F.3d at 1353. In <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, we held that the passover provisions must be applied to FCIP auditor hiring, finding that the application of section 3318 was not infeasible despite the absence of examinations for auditor positions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> But the appropriations riders not only bar attorney examinations; they also bar attorney ratings. We think that this feature is indeed inconsistent with the passover provisions because on its face, section 3318 requires the submission of a certificate that ranks applicants, and "passing over" a preference eligible requires that he initially be among the "highest three eligibles...on the certificate furnished" by OPM. In contrast, there was no congressional bar with respect to ranking for the auditor position at issue in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, and the applicant in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> was in fact ranked under "a category rating system," which we concluded made it possible to apply the statutory passover provisions. 550 F.3d at 1350, 1353.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the statutory provision barring ranking of attorneys, which has been in place since 1944, it is not possible for OPM to provide a certificate of attorney applicants that is a predicate to the passover provisions of section 3318. Therefore, the Board did not err in concluding that the agencies were exempt from the procedures of 3318 and were not required to file written reasons with OPM and seek OPM's permission before selecting candidates other than Jarrard.</p>
