<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-12"><span class="space">B.</span> WAIVER OF HEARING</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the appellant has a right to a hearing, the right may be waived. Waiver of a hearing is a significant matter: the appeal will be decided on the record alone. Some appellants choose not to have hearings, preferring adjudication on the basis of the record compiled by the appellant and the agency. It may occur that the agency record is so poor that it is best to waive a hearing so that the agency will be precluded from improving its record during a hearing--assuming the agency cannot substantively bolster the record through additional written evidentiary submissions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the appellant has the right to a hearing, the appellant must request it from the Board, 5 CFR 1201.24 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Content of an appeal; right to hearing.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Content</span>. Only an appellant, his or her designated representative, or a party properly substituted under &#x00A7; 1201.35 may file an appeal. Appeals may be in any format, including letter form. An appeal may be filed in electronic form provided that the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.14 have been satisfied. All appeals must contain the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A request for hearing if the appellant wants one;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Right to hearing</span>. An appellant generally has a right to a hearing on the merits if the appeal has been timely filed and the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timely request</span>. The appellant must submit any request for a hearing with the appeal, or within any other time period the judge sets for that purpose. If the appellant does not make a timely request for a hearing, the right to a hearing is waived.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The hearing is ordinarily requested as part of the appeal that the appellant files. <span id="Page_1313"></span>If the appeal is through e-filing, the Board's electronic inquiry asks whether the appellant desires a hearing. The Board's appeal form has a section to check if a hearing is required. The acknowledgment order that follows the docketing of the appeal should say if the appellant has a given amount of time to request a hearing if a hearing was not earlier requested.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming a hearing is requested, for whatever reason the route is chosen, intentional waiver of a hearing must be knowing and authorized. An undesignated representative may not effectively waive an appellant's hearing. <span class="Italic">Hightower v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 28 MSPR 281, 282 (1985). Nor does waiver occur if the appellant misunderstands a comment by an AJ concerning settlement at a prehearing conference. Because the right to a hearing is statutory, its waiver must be demonstrated by clear and unequivocal acts or statements. An appellant who is represented by counsel and declines a hearing on an appeals form demonstrates "a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act showing a purpose amounting to estoppel on her part." <span class="Italic">Howell v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 321, 322 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Black v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 83, 84 (1989) (AJ should have responded to the appellant's request for assistance in locating a critical witness rather than allowing her to rely on possibly misleading statements from the agency concerning the location of the witness and then forfeiting a hearing); <span class="Italic">Sweat v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 84, 87 (1989) (hearing was waived by implication if there is a clear, unequivocal and decisive act showing that purpose; the appellant's statement that he would like a hearing but "was not able to go through with it" was not a waiver; appellant should have been advised of the possibilities of adjustment of the hearing location, a telephone hearing, or dismissal without prejudice pending appellant's ability to participate in a hearing). The right to a hearing is so fundamental that the Board has considered the matter of waiver <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> in a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rossbach v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DC-315I-14-0066-I-1 (NP 2/17/2016).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If statements made at a prehearing conference are relied on to establish a waiver of the hearing, the conference should be documented, the documentation should be provided to the parties, and the parties should have the opportunity to comment on the accuracy and completeness of the documentation. <span class="Italic">McBurney v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 126, 130-31 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 381, 383-84 (1996) (remanding for an AJ to properly explain, if necessary, with reference to the telephonic prehearing conference, a basis for the AJ's conclusion that the hearing was waived through the appellant's clear, unequivocal, and decisive action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pignataro v. VA,</span> 104 MSPR 563, 567-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2007 MSPB 30 (2007), summarized the law concerning waiver, emphasizing that waiver is not to be lightly construed and that the waiver issue is not to be sidestepped by the AJ denying the hearing as a sanction for failing to comply with an order, particularly when the case involves a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant and lacking extraordinary circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), an appellant before the Board in an appeal of an adverse action has a right to a hearing. Although such right is subject to waiver, the policy considerations in favor of a hearing are so strong that an appellant may only waive the right by clear, unequivocal, or decisive action. <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 8 (2001); <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 5 (1999); <span class="Italic">Stein-Verbit v. Department of Commerce</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1996). Further, her waiver must be an informed one. <span class="Italic">Gallegos</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 8. An appellant may also effectively waive a hearing by acts amounting to an estoppel. <span class="Italic">Beyer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 672, 676 (1988). "An appellant's waiver of the right to a hearing is informed when she has been fully apprised of the relevant adjudicatory requirements and options in her case, including the right to request a postponement or continuance of the hearing and a dismissal of the appeal without prejudice to its timely refilling." <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 1 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record here does not support a finding that the appellant waived her right to a hearing by either knowingly taking a clear, unequivocal, or decisive action, or by committing an act that would amount to estoppel on her part. The AJ characterized the discussion during the prehearing conference as amounting to a waiver. There is, however, no written waiver in the record, and the AJ's comments are so abbreviated that it is impossible to ascertain whether he "fully apprised [the appellant] of the relevant adjudicatory requirements and options in her case," <span class="Italic">see id.,</span> or considered and rejected her claim that she had been hospitalized when the pre-hearing submissions were due. He did not record the conference. Further, any claim that the agency might make about what transpired at the conference is not evidence. <span class="Italic">Hendricks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 163, 168 (1995). The appellant, on the other hand, objected to the AJ's depiction of the conference clearly and in a timely fashion, given the effects of Hurricane Wilma. After she objected, the AJ offered her a hearing, but told her she could not call witnesses. She thus petitioned for an interlocutory appeal of his decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's actions directly contradict the AJ's assertion that she waived her right to a hearing. Instead, they suggest that she quickly sought to correct the AJ's characterization of the conference and tried to exercise her right to a hearing without the constraints imposed by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Cf. Caracciolo</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 5 ("Here, there is no pleading in the record indicating that the appellant intended to waive her right to a hearing. On the contrary, the appellant's multiple submissions indicate that she intended to continue prosecuting her appeal."). In reaching this conclusion, we do not intend to imply that the appellant handled her appeal flawlessly. She failed to meet three deadlines (although she explained her actions), and she did not document her hospital admission beyond the facsimile message from her sister and the unsworn statement she made on October 26. Nevertheless, the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, <span class="Italic">see Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table), and the policy considerations in favor of holding a hearing are not easily defeated, <span class="Italic">Gallegos</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 1; <span class="Italic">Schnugg v. Department of Defense</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 510, 513-14 (1994). In the past, the Board has rejected agency arguments regarding "constructive waiver" or estoppel because of similar actions on the part of an appellant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6; 21 (2000) (by failing to object during prehearing conference); <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 211, 213-14 (1987) (by failing to submit adequate medical documentation in response to order to show why her illness had prevented her from attending hearing); <span class="Italic">Gandolph v. Department of Transportation</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 427, 428-29 (1983) (by submitting written evidence to be considered in response to the presiding official's advice that doing so would expedite the case); <span class="Italic">Webb v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 389, 392-93 (1980) (by failing to respond to AJ's request for confirmation of hearing and failing to submit a list of witnesses to be called).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we note that in the order of November 3, the AJ appears to have shifted his rationale from finding that the appellant had waived a hearing to imposing a sanction for failing to file a prehearing submission. An appellant's right to a hearing should not be denied as a sanction absent extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">Sims v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2001); <span class="Italic">Caracciolo</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7; <span class="Italic">see also Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922-23 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (declining to uphold the AJ's failure to hold a hearing as an "implicit sanction" after the appellant failed to respond to the agency's interrogatories). Although the appellant might have been more diligent in prosecuting her appeal, her hospitalization and the hurricane serve to mitigate her deficiencies. Additionally, she eventually filed an extensive submission. Moreover, the AJ waited until September 2005 to reschedule the hearing when the appellant contends without contradiction that she requested a 30-day extension in early May 2005, after her mother's death. Having waited this length of time, it was unreasonable for the AJ to have denied the appellant's extension requests, particularly when she had been hospitalized with symptoms consistent with multiple sclerosis the day before her documents were due. We thus cannot find in her conduct any negligence or abuses that would rise to the level of "extraordinary circumstances" warranting the sanction of denying her a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hart v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (1999) (appellant's inadvertent failure to make herself available for prehearing conference and to file a timely prehearing submission did not warrant the extreme sanction of denying her a hearing); <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (1998) (appellant's failure to file timely prehearing submission did not warrant sanction of barring her from presenting witnesses at hearing). Given these circumstances, we are compelled to resolve any doubts in the appellant's favor and to provide her with an opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DeLoach v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 108 MSPR 485, 489 &#x00B6; 14, 2008 MSPB 78 (2008) ("[T]he appellant did not clearly, unequivocally, and decisively waive his right to a hearing[.] ").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No hearing waiver will be construed if the appellant relies on misleading statements made by an AJ concerning the state of the evidentiary record. <span class="Italic">Siu v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 394, 397 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 275, 282 &#x00B6; 13 (2000) (hearing was not waived if the appellant withdrew the hearing request based on an incorrect statement by the AJ concerning the appellant's burden of proof in a retirement case); <span class="Italic">Spradlin v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 279, 283-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (1999) (appellant did not waive the hearing if he believed that statements made during status or prehearing conferences were made in a hearing and had evidentiary weight; nonattorney representative; the AJ may have been ambiguous as to whether a decision was made on the appellant's hearing request). If a hearing depends on a jurisdictional point, the appellant's waiver is not knowing and informed if the AJ fails to make clear the nature of the jurisdictional issue and the type of proof needed to address that issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 647, 650-51 (1993); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dorsett v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 345, 349 (1997) (AJ failed to inform the parties of issues involved in the appeal so that they could make an informed decision on whether to pursue those issues; the case was remanded with leave of the appellant to renew the hearing request). A record that was unclear as to communications between the AJ and the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant concerning whether a case would be decided on a written record, rather than the hearing that the appellant claimed she sought, was remanded for a hearing, with the observation, referencing videoconference hearings, that "because there is no statutory right to an in-person hearing, the <span id="Page_1314"></span>AJ need not necessarily hold one." <span class="Italic">Campbell v. DOD</span>, 102 MSPR 178, 180-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9, 2006 MSPB 148 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Koehler v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> 99 MSPR 82 (2005), involving videoconference hearings).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will consider an appellant's allegation that he was coerced by the AJ into waiving the hearing in order that the AJ might issue a decision within the time limits set by the AJ's performance standards or Board internal guidelines. <span class="Italic">Villapando v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 49 MSPR 485, 488-90 (1991), determined that the appellant's proof did not demonstrate coercion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant initially requested a hearing and was represented by counsel. The hearing, originally scheduled for November 17, 1989, was rescheduled to December 15, 1989, due to the appellant's attorney having sustained a heart attack on November 10. The appellant states that he telephoned the administrative judge after learning on November 17 that his attorney had suffered a relapse and would require an additional month to recuperate. He says that the administrative judge told him that postponing the hearing date a second time would push the case too close to the administrative judge's deadline, and that the appellant should consider withdrawing his case and refiling when his attorney had recovered. The appellant states that he told the administrative judge that, being without a source of income, he could not afford to drop the case and refile at a later point in time, and asked about getting a new attorney. He says the administrative judge told him this would not work because a new attorney would only ask for a thirty-day extension, again pushing the case back to the deadline. The appellant says he then asked about representing himself at the hearing, and the administrative judge told him that he would be at a big disadvantage, since the agency's attorney was a professional and presented herself very well in the courtroom.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant, the administrative judge then suggested that the case be submitted without hearing on the written record, in which event the administrative judge could have a decision out in seven days. When the appellant expressed concern about not knowing how to present the case on the written record, he says the administrative judge assured him that he would advise and direct the appellant as to the form and content of the necessary written submission. The appellant states that he telephoned the administrative judge numerous times during the next month for his advice and counsel, but that the administrative judge never advised him that evidentiary submissions should be in affidavit form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party's unsupported assertions of coercion are insufficient to overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity due to administrative judges. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Department of the Navy,</span> 44 MSPR 373, 376 (1990). Other than substantiating that he telephoned the Dallas Regional Office several times during the period in question, the appellant has offered no evidence to corroborate his claim that the administrative judge erroneously denied his request for a continuance or that the administrative judge coerced or misled him into waiving a hearing with the assistance of counsel. By failing to submit a written request for a continuance, as required by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.51(b), the appellant bears partial responsibility for the gap in the record concerning his discussion with the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the credibility of the appellant's version of events is undercut by his failure to complain about the purported denial of his request for a continuance, or the administrative judge's alleged intimidation, until filing his petition for review....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considerations concerning waiver and documentation of waiver of a hearing were summed up by <span class="Italic">Conant v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 148, 150-51 &#x00B6; 1 (1998), admonishing AJs to ensure that appellants are advised of the consequences of, and alternatives to, waiver:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's right to a hearing in a Board appeal is of cardinal importance and is not contingent upon her showing of a genuine issue of material facts. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 416, 423 (1996). An appellant has the right to withdraw her request for a hearing in her appeal. <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 224, 233 (1993), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Costin v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 72 MSPR 525, 532-33 and by <span class="Italic">White v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 521, 525-28 (1996). The effect of an appellant's request to forego a hearing is adjudication based on the record. <span class="Italic">Davila v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 MSPR 5, 7 (1991). Because, however, strong policy considerations favor granting an appellant a hearing on the merits of her case, an appellant may waive the right to a hearing only by clear, unequivocal, or decisive action. <span class="Italic">See Nugent v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 59 MSPR 444, 446 (1993), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 36 F.3d 1107 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Schnugg v. Department of Defense</span>, 60 MSPR 510, 512 (1994); <span class="Italic">Davila,</span> 50 MSPR at 7-8. Further, the waiver must be an informed one. <span class="Italic">Rogers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 MSPR 647, 652 (1993). An appellant's waiver of the right to a hearing is informed when she has been fully apprised of the relevant adjudicatory requirements and options in her case, including the right to request a postponement or continuance of the hearing and a dismissal of the appeal without prejudice to its timely refiling. <span class="Italic">See id.;</span> <span class="Italic">Casimier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 MSPR 35 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also Reid</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 182, 185-86 (1998); <span class="Italic">Davila</span>, 50 MSPR at 8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pariseau v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 113 MSPR 370, 373-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2010 MSPB 46 (2010) (AJ should have informed the appellant of options, including postponement or continuance of the hearing, or DWOP, when the appellant asked the AJ to cancel the hearing because of an immediate, but temporary, need for the appellant's attention to a family medical problem; on PFR the appellant stated that he wanted a hearing; the Board remanded the case to allow the appellant a hearing if his case was within Board jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Shingles v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 245, 248-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2001) (remanding for hearing on an EEO issue when the AJ scheduled the hearing, the AJ advised the appellant during the prehearing conference that the hearing was limited to jurisdiction, and the prehearing order "did not fully describe the circumstances surrounding the appellant's withdrawal of his request for a hearing").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sincero v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 239, 241-43 (1989), cautioned AJs against construing as a waiver of a hearing, rather than as a request for a change in the location of a hearing, an appellant's statement that he wants but cannot afford a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a resident of the Philippines....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and his command of English is minimal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant asserted in his addendum to his petition for appeal that he could not afford to retain counsel to represent him before the regional office and he requested an "<span class="Italic">ex parte</span> hearing of the case" because he could not afford to attend a hearing....&#8197;[T]he administrative judge...did not respond to the appellant's request for an "<span class="Italic">ex parte</span> hearing." Instead, the administrative judge informed the parties that the appeal would be decided based on the parties' written submission in light of the appellant's failure to request a hearing, and he subsequently affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision based on the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge never advised the appellant of his burden of proof and his right to a hearing on the merits. The appellant was not advised of the Board's practice of holding hearings at a location that is advantageous to the parties, as well as to the Board....&#8197;Although the appellant stated that he desired an "<span class="Italic">ex parte</span> hearing" because he could not afford to retain counsel or attend the hearing himself, he was not advised that hearing locations can be adjusted to accommodate the parties and that a hearing can be conducted telephonically. The administrative judge also did not advise the appellant that if he is physically unable to attend any form of hearing but desires one, the administrative judge could dismiss the appeal without prejudice and convene the hearing later....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appeal must be remanded to the regional office and the appellant must be advised of: (1) His right to a hearing on the merits; (2) his right to call relevant witnesses such as his former supervisors and co-workers, family members, and friends in support of his case; (3) his burden of proof; and (4) the Board's hearing procedures....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant did not waive a hearing when he stated as to his enforcement petition that he stood ready to "testify under oath" concerning the matters in dispute. <span class="Italic">Beaudin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 597, 601 n.* (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 87 MSPR 359, 368 &#x00B6; 21 (2000) (appellant did not waive a hearing when she failed to object during a telephonic prehearing conference to the "possibility" that the appeal would be decided without review of her affirmative defenses, based upon the validity of performance standards); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 3 MSPR 556, 557 (1980) ("The Board views appellant's statement in his appeal that he was prepared to present his evidence orally as an indication of his anticipation of a hearing. The phrase in the acknowledgement from the Field Office stating '[i]f you did not request a hearing in your petition for appeal, you may amend your petition...' is ambiguous in that it did not clearly indicate to appellant that a further request was necessary. Failure to definitively ascertain whether a hearing was desired effectively denied appellant his right to a hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The importance of avoiding unintended waivers of hearings was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Berry v. VA</span>, 51 MSPR 317, 321 (1991). On the day before the hearing, the appellant's representative requested a continuance, stating that he had not received the hearing notice and only learned of the hearing through a discussion with the agency representative. On the day of the hearing, the representative appeared but the appellant did not. The AJ denied the continuance and adjourned the hearing after waiting for the appellant to appear. The appellant then filed a brief affidavit saying he did not receive the hearing notice. The AJ determined the hearing notice was received because it was sent to the appellant and not returned in the mail. The Board concluded that the appellant did not waive a hearing; the AJ did not clearly state the options available to appellant's counsel during the hearing and prior to the adjournment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding this case on the basis of the written record, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 748 F.2d 1556, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1984), which held that an administrative judge may issue a decision based on the record alone where an appellant fails to attend his hearing without good cause....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Callahan</span>, however, because Mr. Callahan was a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant with no one at the hearing to represent <span id="Page_1315"></span>his interests. This appellant, however, had a representative present at the hearing who had the legal authority to act on the appellant's behalf. Standing in the appellant's stead, the representative was entitled, if he chose, to proceed with the hearing, hear the agency's oral evidence, cross-examine the agency's witnesses, present witnesses for the appellant, and present closing argument on the appellant's behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's right to a hearing is of cardinal importance, and the appellant may waive this right only by clear, unequivocal, and decisive action<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Massey v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 435, 437 (1986). The appearance of the appellant's representative at the hearing with his witnesses does not suggest such a waiver, despite the appellant's absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that after waiting a reasonable amount of time for the appellant to appear, the administrative judge should have informed the appellant's representative of the alternatives, namely, proceeding with the hearing, having a decision on the written record, or requesting a continuance....&#8197;By failing to afford the appellant's representative these choices, and by ostensibly making the choice for him[2], the administrative judge effectively denied the appellant the statutory hearing which he requested and to which he is entitled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;When the administrative judge went on the record to explain why the hearing had been adjourned, he did not permit the appellant's representative to make any statement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The proper procedure for the no-show appellant was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 537, 541-42 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hen an appellant does not appear for a hearing but his representative is present, the administrative judge must wait a reasonable amount of time for the appellant to appear. Then the administrative judge should inform the appellant's representative of the alternatives of proceeding with the hearing, having a decision on the written record, or requesting a continuance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Waiver may be implied through some acts permitting an inference of intentional waiver. The failure to request a hearing is now deemed a waiver. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 35 MSPR 322, 324 (1987) ("The failure to timely request a hearing will result in the waiver of that right"; the acknowledgment order clearly stated that a hearing had to be requested within 15 days or it would be waived); 5 CFR 1201.24(e) (2022). At one point agencies could request a hearing (no longer the case), and the rules governing waiver applied to the agency as well. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gregory v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 14, 15 (1984). Appellants should be informed that unreasonable objection to the various ways the Board can accommodate a hearing request may be deemed an implied waiver of the right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 362, 364 (1992) (incarcerated employee; also suggesting the undesirability of voluntary dismissals without prejudice in indefinite suspension appeals).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Waiver issues are best addressed before the initial decision is issued. If a hearing is properly deemed waived by the AJ, the Board will not grant a request for a hearing contained in the PFR. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 5 MSPR 57, 58, 5 MSPB 133 (1981) (hearing was expressly waived by the appellant; neither the appellant nor his representative responded when the AJ advised them that they could amend the appeal to request a hearing). But if the appellant presents evidence in the PFR (through affidavits or other means) indicating that he did not obtain a hearing because he was not notified of the hearing, the appeal will be remanded for a hearing. <span class="Italic">Hobby v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 5 MSPR 446, 447, 5 MSPB 452 (1981). [Refer to this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-10-023.html#sec3-23">Adjudication After Waiver, Failure to Attend Hearing</a>."]</p>
