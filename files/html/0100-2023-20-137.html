<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-132"><span class="space">2.</span> Failure to Take Personnel Action</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Dept. of Army</span>, 92 MSPR 572, 579-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-20 (2002), determined that under the WPA the Board has jurisdiction to consider a claim that the agency failed to take a desired personnel action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the Board's jurisdiction in IRA cases is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) which, unlike section 2302(b)(8), does not refer to an agency's failure to take a personnel action with respect to an employee. Section 1221(a) does provide that "[s]ubject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and subsection [sic] 1214(a)(3)," employees may seek corrective action from the Board with respect to "any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee...as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8)." As set forth below, sections 1221(a) and 2302(b)(8) should be read together to comport with the findings and primary purposes of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress stated that the purpose of the WPA was to "strengthen and improve protection for the rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and to help eliminate wrongdoing within Government by mandating that employees should not suffer <span class="Italic">adverse consequences</span> as a result of prohibited personnel practices...." Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, &#x00A7; 2(b), 103 Stat. 16; 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 1201 note (West 1996) (emphasis added). Thus, the purpose" language of the WPA suggests that Congress sought to broadly protect whistleblowers from "adverse consequences" as a result of prohibited personnel practices, whether those "adverse consequences" result from personnel actions that are taken or personnel actions that are not taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the WPA also suggests that personnel actions not taken by an agency can be appealed directly to the Board. The House Report provides that the WPA "creates an individual right of action, so that employees who are the victims of <span class="Italic">prohibited personnel practices</span> can seek stays and corrective action directly from the MSPB, without involvement of the OSC." H.R. Rep. No. 100-274, at 16 (1987) (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1347-48 (Fed. Cir. 2001). (it is proper to consider, for guidance in interpreting the WPA, the legislative history of the version of the WPA that President Reagan pocket-vetoed after the 100th Congress adjourned, where the language did not change). The Senate Report provides that "[e]mployees...may appeal directly to the MSPB if they allege a prohibited personnel practice as defined under 2303(b)(8) [sic] USC 5 (reprisal for whistleblowing), if they appeal first to the OSC, and if the OSC subsequently terminates the investigation of their case or if they have not been notified within 90 days of filing an allegation that the OSC shall seek corrective action on, their behalf.... [T]his provision is intended to allow whistleblowers <span class="Italic">who suffer reprisal</span> the further right of appeal to the MSPB once the OSC route is exhausted." S. Rep. No. 100-413, at 32 (1988) (emphasis added). The term "prohibited personnel action" is defined, in part, as a failure to take a personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(1), 2302(b)(8). No distinction, therefore, is made in the legislative history between protecting whistleblowers from personnel actions taken, as opposed to personnel actions not taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the circumstances and reasoning of the Board in <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 384 (1991), support this interpretation. In <span class="Italic">Gergick,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. at 386, the AJ dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, the appellant's IRA appeal alleging that the agency had threatened to take a personnel action against him in retaliation for whistleblowing. The agency argued that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), threatened actions could not be appealed to the Board because only actions that have been taken or proposed to be taken are mentioned in that provision. <span class="Italic">Gergick,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. at 390. The Board disagreed, reversed the initial decision, and found that although section 1221(a), when read in isolation, appeared to provide that threatened actions could not be the subject of an IRA appeal, section 1214(a)(3), which also was enacted as part of the WPA, and to which section 1221(a) specifically referred, indicated that threatened actions may be appealed under section 1221. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board therefore found that because a threat to discipline an employee in retaliation for making protected disclosures was covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), his appeal of that threatened personnel action <span id="Page_3884"></span>was covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 391. Similarly, we find that because a failure to take a personnel action is covered by section 2302(b)(8), it may be appealed to the Board under section 1221. This conclusion is consistent with court and Board cases finding that a failure to take a personnel action, such as a nonselection for a vacancy or a promotion, are appealable in IRA cases. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Knollenberg v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 953 F.2d 623, 625 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 204 &#x00B6; 9 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A finding by the Board that section 1221(a) must be read as excluding an agency's failure to take a personnel action for retaliatory reasons from the Board's IRA jurisdiction would effectively repeal part of the language in section 2302(b)(8), which is incorporated by reference in section 1221(a), and which provides that such failure-to-take actions are a prohibited personnel practice if based on any protected disclosure. Repeals by implication are disfavored and are only justified when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable<span class="Italic">. Morton v. Mancari</span>, 417 U.S. 535, 549-50, 94 S. Ct. 2474, 41 L. Ed.2d 290 (1974). Further, such a narrow interpretation of section 1221(a) would be contrary to the findings and purposes of the WPA because, by effectively repealing part of section 2302(b)(8), employees bringing IRA cases would have less protection from retaliation than was provided to employees under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (CSRA). These factors strongly support interpreting section 1221(a) in a manner that construes this WPA provision, together with the CSRA provision at section 2302(b)(8), in a manner that effectuates the purposes of both statutes<span class="Italic">. See Auker v. Department of Defense,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 468 &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (the CSRA attorney fee provision at section 7701(g)(1) applied to IRA appeals that were settled because, among other things, a contrary finding would make it more difficult for prevailing IRA appellants to obtain fees than appellants who prevailed under the CSRA, contrary to Congressional intent). The WPA is remedial legislation, intended to improve protections for Federal employees, and should be construed to effectuate that purpose. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 22, 32 (1996); <span class="Italic">see Singleton v. Ohio National Guard</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 583, 587 (1998) (the definition of "personnel action" must be interpreted broadly as part of the WPA, a remedial statute). Thus, under the circumstances of this appeal, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that LaMarra's reassignment to the Budget position, which had the purpose and effect of preventing the appellant from being assigned to that position, is a personnel action within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Reversing the Board, the Federal Circuit decided that an IRA case may be based on an agency's cancelation of a vacancy announcement without a selection or recommendation for a selection, <span class="Italic">Ruggieri v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20061777454f3d132311777">454 F.3d 1323</a>, 1325-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The narrow legal question presented by this appeal is whether an agency triggers the Whistleblower Protection Act by "fail[ing] to take...a personnel action," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), when the agency declines to hire an applicant pursuant to a vacancy announcement, but instead of hiring a different person cancels the vacancy announcement and hires no one for the position at that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act contains a broad definition of "personnel action," which includes "an appointment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i). The Act further provides that it is unlawful for an employee who is authorized to take or approve personnel actions to "take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant" because of any protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Thus, the Act covers the "failure" to make an "appointment" in the federal service when that action is because of a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ruggieri's argument is simple. He contends that when he was not selected for the advertised position of electrical engineer under the first vacancy announcement, the action of not selecting him constituted the "fail[ure] to take...a personnel action," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), to wit, an "appointment," <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act. He therefore contends that the Board improperly dismissed his appeal on jurisdictional grounds and instead should have addressed the merits of his claim that the agency took that action for prohibited reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government takes the position that even though Mr. Ruggieri was not selected under the first vacancy announcement, there was not a failure to appoint him, because the vacancy announcement was canceled and no one was appointed to the position. In the government's view, an agency does not fail to appoint an applicant when it cancels the vacancy announcement under which the applicant applied. The government argues that the failure to appoint occurs only when the agency appoints someone else to the position sought by the applicant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has addressed this issue on several occasions, it is an issue of first impression for us. The Board's decisions characterize "nonselection for a position" as a qualifying "fail[ure] to take...a personnel action" within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act but they define nonselection narrowly, recognizing such a claim only if the position in question is ultimately filled by someone other than the complainant. <span class="Italic">See Di Pompo v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 44, 47 (1994); <span class="Italic">Wuchinich v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 220, 223 (1992); <span class="Italic">Slake v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 207, 215-16 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's position on this issue reflects an unduly narrow construction of the statutory language "fail to take...a personnel action." The Whistleblower Protection Act does not state that the failure to select an applicant for employment cannot be actionable unless someone else is selected for the position in the applicant's place. If the statute defined a failure to make an appointment as the act of hiring another applicant in place of the complainant, the Board's construction would have force. But it does not. It provides that an appointment is a personnel action and that a failure to make an appointment is a trigger for an Individual Right of Action appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To endorse the Board's interpretation of the statute would immunize an agency's decision not to hire a whistleblower, so long as the agency was willing simply not to fill the position for which the whistleblower had applied, even if the agency's conduct was plainly motivated by whistleblowing activity. This case illustrates the potential mischief that could be caused by the Board's interpretation. For purposes of the jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge accepted Mr. Ruggieri's allegations that the agency declined to hire him because he had made disclosures protected by section 2308(b)(8). Therefore, as this case comes to us, we must assume that Mr. Ruggieri's allegations of retaliation for whistleblowing are true. The Board's position, however, is that he is entitled to no relief under the Whistleblower Protection Act because the agency, even though it rejected his application and did not appoint him, did so by canceling the vacancy announcement rather than appointing a different applicant to the position. Thus, under the Board's interpretation of the Act, the agency could lawfully refuse to hire an applicant because of his whistleblowing activities, as long as it did not hire a different applicant under the particular vacancy announcement in which the whistleblower applied. Nothing in the statutory language or the underlying purpose of the Act suggests that Congress intended to endorse such a formalistic restriction on the type of agency action that would trigger the Whistleblower Protection Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not to say that any delay in making an employment decision would qualify as a failure to take a personnel action within the meaning of the Act. We acknowledge that it is often more difficult to determine when an agency has failed to take a personnel action than when it has taken a personnel action." For that reason, the Board has stated in an analogous setting that the failure to make an appointment must manifest itself as a "concrete matter that can be taken or done by an agency and reviewed (and undone) by the Board." <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (1991). We disagree, however, with the Board's suggestion in this case that the only way to define nonselection as a concrete matter falling within the scope of the Act is by restricting it to cases in which an agency has hired someone other than the complainant for an announced vacancy. Instead, the agency must take some identifiable step that constitutes a decision not to hire the complainant. That step may be the hiring of another person in the applicant's stead, but it need not be. In this case, the agency plainly took such a step, as it decided to terminate the hiring process that it had put into effect, by canceling the vacancy announcement. Indeed, the agency affirmed the finality of that decision by sending Mr. Ruggieri a letter advising him that he was not selected for the advertised position. The agency's conduct in this case is sufficient, under the plain language of the statute, to constitute a "fail[ure] to take...a personnel action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Including such conduct within the reach of the Whistleblower Protection Act is consistent with Congress's purpose to protect whistleblowers from a wide variety of actions taken against them in retaliation for protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Caddell v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 96 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Marano v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1139-41 (Fed. Cir. <span id="Page_3885"></span>1993). In light of that congressional purpose, as reflected in the broad statutory language, we hold that Mr. Ruggieri's evidence regarding his nonselection for the position of electrical engineer was sufficient to satisfy the requirement that an appellant in an Individual Right of Action appeal make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency has failed to take a personnel action. We therefore reverse the decision on appeal and remand this case to the Board for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Ruggieri</span>, <span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEED_ALVERN_C_DE_1221_09_0320_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_473250.pdf">113 MSPR 221</a>, 230-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17, 2010 MSPB 23 (2010), determined that a claim was stated within the Board's IRA jurisdiction that an agency took reprisal, following complaint by appellant to OSC of improper agency hiring practices, of manipulating appointments to exclude the appellant from consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alternatively argues on review that the Board does not have jurisdiction over this appeal because the appellant's allegation that it improperly used FCIP to fill vacancies in the Montana Field Office was not a "personnel action" for the purposes of the WPA, such as a transfer or a promotion. In other words, the agency asserts that "the manner in which positions are advertised does not constitute a personnel action covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's argument again is an unduly narrow and cramped reading of the scope of the statute. The appellant has alleged in this appeal that, in the midst of continuing litigation in his first Board appeal and a related EEOC case, the agency failed to appoint him to several positions by knowingly and intentionally taking actions to insure that he was unaware of, and could not apply for, the positions at issue. Essentially, the appellant has alleged that the agency used FCIP as part of a scheme to deny him an "appointment" within the meaning of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit has found that the term "appointment," as used in the statute, covers an expansive range of acts and failures to act by an agency. In <span class="Italic">Ruggieri v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 454 F.3d 1323, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the Court said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Whistleblower Protection Act contains a broad definition of "personnel action," which includes "an appointment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i). The Act further provides that it is unlawful for an employee who is authorized to take or approve personnel actions to "take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant" because of any protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Thus, the Act covers the "failure" to make an "appointment" in the federal service when that action is because of a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ruggieri</span>, a former Coast Guard employee alleged that the Department of Energy retaliated against him on the basis that the agency did not select him for a position because of whistleblowing activities during his earlier employment with the Coast Guard. <span class="Italic">Ruggieri</span>, 454 F.3d at 1324-25. The agency contended that it had not taken a "personnel action" under the Act because it had not selected anyone from the vacancy announcement in which the appellant had applied. Instead, it later filled the position from a different vacancy announcement to which the appellant had not applied. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because it determined that an agency's failure to make any selection from a vacancy announcement was not a "personnel action" under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1325. The court reversed the decision and remanded the case because the agency's conduct, i.e., its decision to terminate the hiring process by canceling the vacancy announcement, was sufficient under the plain language of the statute, to constitute a "fail[ure] to take...a personnel action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 132627. The court noted that to find otherwise would permit an agency to lawfully refuse to hire an employee because of whistleblowing activities, as long as it did not hire a different applicant under the particular vacancy announcement in which the whistleblower applied. The court said, "[n]othing in the statutory language or the underlying purpose of the Act suggests that Congress intended to endorse such a formalistic restriction on the type of agency action that would trigger the Whistleblower Protection Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1326.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's interpretation of "appointment" in the instant case would similarly place an improper constraint on an individual's right to seek redress for whistleblower retaliation. Given that an agency's action can be considered a covered personnel action simply by leaving a position vacant and not filling it with anyone, then an agency could engage in a prohibited retaliatory personnel action by intentionally using a particular selection process as part of a scheme that would deny a whistleblower an opportunity to seek the appointment. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has shown that he was an "employee" who has sufficiently alleged that he was subjected to a retaliatory "personnel action" under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Ruggieri,</span> the cancelation of a vacancy announcement was beyond the Board's WPA jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Slake v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 207, 215-16 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To find that the appellant's complaint centers on a personnel action would be to extend the Board's reach beyond its congressionally-mandated limits by finding not just that the Board may assert jurisdiction over a personnel action, but also that it may do so over any stage in the stream of proceedings leading to a personnel action, even those in which the appellant may have only some speculative interest. While subsection (a)(2)(A)(ix) extends Board authority to matters that may "lead to" a promotion, even this cautious and precise enumeration reflects Congress' strong concern with restricting the Board's jurisdiction to cases in which the action appealed is specific, readily demonstrable, and closely or directly related to the grant or denial of some benefit or the taking of some adverse action.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We must decline King's invitation to expand the scope of the WPA to discussions preliminary to a formal job offer. To hold otherwise would unnecessarily constrain agency flexibility in allocation of personnel and resources. It could also open the door for every employee who believed himself to be deserving of promotion to bring an action against his employing agency for its failure to see the employee's worth in a similar light. This is not a sensible reading of the statute.</p>
