<p class="Body-Text">The discussion that follows concerns creation of a rebuttable inference of reprisal through a disclosure made known to an official who reasonably quickly takes or fails to take a personnel action challenged as retaliatory. Without a legally sufficient explanation for the action, reprisal is inferred as a matter of law and corrective action is to be ordered. The statutory basis for the inference is 5 USC 1221(e)(1), added by the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act, amended by the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant. The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or <span id="Page_3953"></span>protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2) Corrective action under paragraph (1) may not be ordered if, after a finding that a protected disclosure was contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 2012 WPEA, the Board relied heavily on analysis of timing of events leading to an action challenged as retaliation for whistleblowing. But the 2012 statute amended preexisting legislation by adding at 5 USC 2302(f):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;A disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) because--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(G)&#x2003; of the amount of time which has passed since the occurrence of the events described in the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although not linked to 5 USC 2302, a separate statute defining the investigative responsibility of the Special Counsel was amended by the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. 115-91, to permit OSC to avoid investigation of aged allegations of reprisal cases. 5 USC 1214(a) provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(6)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, not later than 30 days after the date on which the Special Counsel receives an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel may terminate an investigation of the allegation without further inquiry if the Special Counsel determines that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;the individual knew or should have known of the alleged prohibited personnel practice on or before the date that is 3 years before the date on which the Special Counsel received the allegation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of legislative history, <span class="Italic">Marana v. MSPB,</span> ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), considered jurisdictionally significant a gap of more than two years between a disclosure and a retaliatory act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to three of those four disclosures, i.e., disclosures number 1, number 3, and number 6, we agree with the administrative judge. The disclosures were remote in time from the personnel actions that Mr. Marana is challenging. <span class="Italic">See Costello v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 182 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("A two-year gap between the disclosures and the allegedly retaliatory action is too long an interval to justify an inference of cause and effect between the two...."); <span class="Italic">Salinas v.

Moreover, as the administrative judge noted, the other circumstances surrounding those disclosures, i.e., the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the disclosures were personally directed at the official responsible for the adverse actions, and whether the responsible official had a motive to retaliate, were not suggestive of retaliation for whistleblowing.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Decisions predating the 2012 statutory change considered timing. Under the newer provisions of the statute, timing still is relevant.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Some Board cases have incorrectly stated that once an appellant nonfrivolously alleges that the knowledge/timing test has been met, the administrative judge must find that the appellant's whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">E.g., Herman v.

MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20160817142">833 F.3d 1349</a>, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2016), allowing for but not crediting an inference of knowledge based only on timing of events:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over individual right of action cases, the appellant must make "non-frivolous allegations" that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and that the protected disclosure "was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action." <span class="Italic">Cahill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 821 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), expressly addresses how the "contributing factor" element of the whistleblower claim can be established. It provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Kerrigan has certainly shown a closeness in timing between the alleged protected disclosure and the personnel action, as described in subsection (B). His letter alleging illegal actions by the OWCP and ECAB was sent to the DOL's Office of Inspector General on November 21, 2001, and forwarded on to the OWCP on December 18, 2001. On that same day, December 18, 2001, the OWCP referred him to vocational training. A few months later, on March 19, 2002, the OWCP reduced his benefits to zero for failure to attend the training. We agree with Mr. Kerrigan that, from a timing perspective, the adverse personnel actions came right on the heels of his accusatory letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But closeness in timing, in and of itself, is not sufficient as a nonfrivolous allegation that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor to the adverse personnel action. In addition to closeness in timing, the statute also describes a knowledge component: "that the official taking the personnel action <span class="Italic">knew</span> of the disclosure or protected activity." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1) (emphasis added). This knowledge factor can be determinative on the question of the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Cahill</span>, 821 F.3d at 1376 (reversing the Board's finding that the contributory factor had not been sufficiently alleged when "the only disputed issue [was] whether any of the agency officials taking the challenged personnel actions <span class="Italic">knew</span> of the March 2012 disclosure") (emphasis added). It is here, at the knowledge component, where Mr. Kerrigan has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nowhere in Mr. Kerrigan's papers does he allege that his November <span id="Page_3954"></span>21, 2001 letter was known to the OWCP persons who referred him to vocational training and terminated his benefits for failure to attend. Rather, the most Mr. Kerrigan has shown is that <span class="Italic">someone</span> within OWCP was aware of his letter on the same day he was referred to vocational training. But the generalized assertion that <span class="Italic">someone</span> within the agency--without any accompanying allegations as to the size, composition, or structure of that agency--is insufficient to establish that the specific agency official taking the personnel action <span class="Italic">knew</span> of the disclosure or protected activity. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cahill</span>, 821 F.3d at 1374-75 (finding jurisdiction when appellant alleged both knowledge and action by agency personnel whom he identified by positions, when the record reflected those positions were occupied by only one person).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That is not to say that, at the jurisdictional stage, an appellant must <span class="Italic">prove</span> knowledge by the acting official. We have previously explained that "[a]t the jurisdictional threshold,... the employee's burden is significantly lower" than at the merits stage. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008). To pass the jurisdictional hurdle, we require only that an appellant at least have made <span class="Italic">non-frivolous allegations</span> that the officials who took the personnel action had knowledge of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 912 n.3 (finding jurisdiction based on appellant's affidavit stating that the acting official knew of her protected disclosure). Here, Mr. Kerrigan has made no allegations that the specific OWCP persons who referred him to training and terminated his benefits knew of his November 21, 2001 letter. And we do not accept his invitation to <span class="Italic">infer</span> their knowledge based only on a closeness in timing and his conclusory allegation that their actions were done "in retaliation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record of this case makes us particularly disinclined to infer knowledge from closeness in timing. Here, the OWCP's referral to vocational training was not a sudden occurrence untethered in time to anything but Mr. Kerrigan's letter. To the contrary, the OWCP's referral was just the latest in a long list of many actions that it had been taking in efforts to adjudicate Mr. Kerrigan's benefits claims. Most notably, the referral for training came just a few months after an orthopedic surgeon recommended that Mr. Kerrigan could return to full-time work. It is therefore not, as Mr. Kerrigan contends, as if the <span class="Italic">only</span> basis for the agency's referral <span class="Italic">must</span> have been knowledge of his letter. In these circumstances, where there are other plausible, indeed likely, reasons for the agency's action, we will not infer knowledge from closeness in timing.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding scheduling and telework, the appellant does not identify the officials who were involved in making these decisions, and the documentary evidence fails to shed any light on the issue. However, we take notice that a first or second-level supervisor would typically be involved in decisions about scheduling and telework.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the AJ acknowledged the knowledge/timing test set forth in the 1994 WPA Amendment, she does not appear to have applied the test. Instead, after finding that Previte had knowledge of the appellant's disclosure prior to her decision to reassign him just a few months later, the AJ considered other circumstantial evidence and found that the appellant's whistleblowing was not a contributing factor in the agency's decision to reassign him. Once the knowledge/timing test has been met, however, an AJ must find that the appellant has shown that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue, even if after a complete analysis of all of the evidence a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that the appellant's whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Powers,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 155-57. Thus, the appellant not only made a non-frivolous allegation of contributing factor, he proved that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel actions. Thus, the Board will go on to examine whether the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions absent the protected activity.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the knowledge/timing test, the Board may consider any relevant evidence on the contributing factor question, including the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the whistleblowing was personally directed at the proposing or deciding officials, and whether these individuals had a desire or motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">See Salinas v. Department of the Army,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 11 (2003). Here, because of the discovery-related sanction imposed on the agency, the AJ did not consider evidence concerning the strengths or weaknesses of the agency's reasons for taking or failing to take a personnel action. However, consideration of such evidence would have had no bearing on the contributing factor analysis. Once the knowledge/timing test has been met, an AJ must find that the appellant has shown that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue, even if after a complete analysis of the evidence a reasonable fact finder could not conclude that the appellant's whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Rubendall,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Carey v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 676, &#x00B6; 13 (2003). Consequently, where the knowledge/timing test has been met, it is not necessary to consider additional evidence on the contributing factor issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given the emphasis on timing in reprisal cases, it was not remarkable that the Board required its AJs to produce initial decisions carefully following the Board's analytical model, <span class="Italic">Hebert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 68, 74-75 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish the affirmative defense of reprisal for whistleblowing activities, an employee must prove by preponderant evidence that a protected disclosure described at 5 USC 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in a personnel action taken against him.... If the employee meets this burden, the agency must show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected disclosure.... One of the many possible ways for an appellant to make the required showing is by establishing that the agency official taking the action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision in the present case does not follow this analytical framework. Instead, the administrative judge simply concluded that the appellant's disclosures were not a contributing factor in the agency's decision to withhold the "outstanding" performance rating because the agency established that it had legitimate management reasons for its actions, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, Coyle's deference to the recommendations of the PRB, based on his desire to standardize the performance evaluation process....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the ground on which the administrative judge's findings are based does not relate to whether the agency had actual or constructive knowledge of the appellant's whistleblowing activities, or whether the agency's action was taken within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the appellant's disclosures played a part in the decision to deny the appellant his "outstanding" performance rating. Rather, the administrative judge, in determining that the appellant did not show that retaliation was a contributing factor in the action at issue, relied upon evidence the agency could have used to show that it would have taken the action in the absence of the appellant's disclosure. This constitutes legal error because, if the appellant establishes that retaliation was a contributing factor, the agency's evidence must be analyzed under the "clear and convincing evidence" standard....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is further flawed in that the initial decision contains no finding on whether the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that his disclosures came within the purview of 5 USC 2302(b)(8)...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the Board developed its case law suggesting that a reprisal case could be made out based on the timing of events, the Federal Circuit complicated matters in <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (a decision that was legislatively overruled in 1994). <span class="Italic">Clark concluded</span> that timing was not determinative for purposes of creating an inference of reprisal and that all <span id="Page_3955"></span>the evidence had to be weighed to determine whether reprisal existed and whether reprisal may have contributed to the action against the appellant. This was the position that the Board first adopted in its analysis of reprisal cases in 1981. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coffield v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 9 MSPR 313, 317 (1981) ("The time factor should not be set aside and viewed independently but should, rather, be considered together and in combination with other factors.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through Public Law 103-424, enacted on October 29, 1994, the <span class="Italic">Clark</span> analysis was legislatively reversed. 5 USC 1221(e)(1) was amended to add:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the personnel action occurred within a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Senate Report 103-358 (1994 USCCAN 3549), interpreting the bill, S. 662, that became Public Law 103-424, explained the purpose of the amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4(b) addresses the evidence an individual may use to prove that a disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action taken against him/her. This provision reverses the holding of <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Army</span>, decided July 1, 1993, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the <span class="Italic">Clark</span> case, the Merit Systems Protection Board interpreted Section 1221(e)(1) to incorporate a knowledge/timing test that allowed a petitioner to prove that whistleblowing was a contributing factor by showing that "the official taking the action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action." This test was taken from the Senate Report on the Whistleblower Protection Act, which expressly stated Congress' intent to incorporate such a standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the Federal Circuit held that the Whistleblower Protection Act did not incorporate a <span class="Italic">per se</span> knowledge/timing test. The court reasoned that the Senate report cited by the MSPB in creating the test referred to S. 508, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1987, which was pocket vetoed by President Reagan and was never enacted. The court noted that S. 20, the bill which was ultimately enacted by the Congress in 1989, "lacks the language of S. 508 which provided for the knowledge/timing test."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, however, the joint explanatory statement that accompanied both S. 508 and S. 20 expressly stated that the managers intended the <span class="Italic">per se</span> test to apply to that bill. The joint statement states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One of many possible ways to show that the whistleblowing was a factor in the personnel action is to show that the official taking the action knew (or had constructive knowledge) of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit rejected the applicability of this statement, concluding that it must have been intended to apply to S. 508, but not to S. 20, because the relevant bill language was changed prior to the enactment of S. 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit was incorrect in its construction of the legislative history. In fact, the language change cited by the court took place prior to the passage of the final version of S. 508 by the Senate and the Houses, and was considered by Congress at the time the Joint Explanatory Statement was first written. As the Joint Explanatory Statement makes clear, the <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule was placed in report language at that time not because Congress did not have a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule to apply, but because Congress wanted to make it clear that proof of knowledge and timing was only "one of many possible ways" that a whistleblower could use to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the amendment in Section 4(b) would restore the balance intended in the Whistleblower Protection Act, by permitting a whistleblower to prove his/her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that the "official taking that action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action." As stated in the Joint Explanatory Statement, this would be only one of many possible ways that a whistleblower could use to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Committee also notes that the Whistleblower Protection Act creates a clear division between a whistleblower's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, which must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, and an agency's affirmative defense, which must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. The Committee amendment reaffirms that Congress intends for an agency's evidence of reasons why it may have acted (other than retaliation) to be presented as part of the affirmative defense and subject to the higher burden of proof.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether reprisal for whistleblowing activities occurred and whether corrective action is warranted, the Board is required by section 14 of the WPA, codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)(A) &#x0026; (B) (1994), to determine whether Ms. Kewley has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the disclosure was "a contributing factor" in the agency's personnel action.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Kewley argues that after finding the timing to be "reasonable," the AJ may not lawfully consider evidence to rebut that finding because Congress has mandated that the burden of proof thereby shifts to the agency and that the agency must meet a higher standard of proof.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As shown in the legislative history and consistent with 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), Congress intended that satisfaction of this "knowledge/timing" test establishes, <span class="Italic">prima facie</span>, that the disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action. When Congress amended the WPA in 1994, <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. L. No. 103-424, 108 Stat. 4361 (1994), it explicitly vitiated the decision of this court in <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1993), which held that the WPA did not incorporate the <span class="Italic">per se</span> knowledge/timing test. The applicable legislative history states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [Federal Circuit] noted that S. 20, the bill which was ultimately enacted by the Congress in 1989, "lacks the language of S. 508 which provided for the knowledge/timing test."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In fact, however, the joint explanatory statement that accompanied both S. 508 and S. 20 expressly stated that the managers intended the <span class="Italic">per se</span> test to apply to that bill.</p>

Department of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279 (Fed. Cir. 1995), in which we held that "the circumstantial evidence of knowledge of the protected disclosure and a reasonable relationship between the time of the protected disclosure and the time of the personnel action will establish, <span class="Italic">prima facie</span>, that the disclosures was a contributing factor to the personnel action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 284.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even prior to the 1994 amendments to the WPA, we recognized Congress's intent to ease the whistleblower's burden of proving that the protected disclosure did satisfy the "contributing factor" test. <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1140 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (stating that "the legislative history of the WPA emphasizes that 'any' weight given to the protected disclosures, either alone or even in combination with other factors, can satisfy the "contributing factor test").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant action, it is undisputed that the official taking the personnel action, Ms. Fifer, knew of Ms. Kewley's protected disclosure. The AJ could only hold, therefore, that the knowledge requirement of subsection (A) of section 1221(e)(1) had been satisfied. As to the timing requirement of subsection (B), however, the AJ found that Ms. Kewley failed to demonstrate preponderantly that the personnel action was a contributing factor in her removal. The AJ found that the agency's timely and favorable response to the disclosure and the lack of evidence of any animus by Ms. Fifer toward Ms. Kewley outweighed the six-week period of time between the disclosure and initiation of the removal action. The AJ specifically reasoned that "the appellant has failed to show how the agency on the one hand reacted affirmatively to her disclosure, but then on the other hand retaliated against her for that disclosure."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that its "swift, effective action" in accepting Ms. Kewley's suggestions submitted in her protected disclosure and implementing of her suggested changes demonstrated that no retaliatory animus <span id="Page_3956"></span>was evident. This contention, however, postulates a requirement that the whistleblower supply proof of hostility by the deciding official. We cannot find any such requirement in the statute. In fact, as we held in <span class="Italic">Marano:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Even] though evidence of a retaliatory motive would still suffice to establish a violation of [the employee's] rights under the WPA...a whistleblower need not demonstrate the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employee taking the alleged prohibited personnel action in order to establish that [her] disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2 F.3d at 1141 (citing S. Rep. No. 100-413 (1988)). Moreover, the legislative history of the 1994 amendments to the WPA compels a different outcome with respect to the agency's argument on this issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Committee amendment reaffirms that Congress intends for a [sic] agency's evidence of reasons why it may have acted (other than retaliation) to be presented as a part of the affirmative defense and subject to the higher burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 7 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3548, 3556.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Congress has made clear, the knowledge/timing test of section 1221(e)(1) must be taken as a whole, but no other factor may be taken into account. In other words, the combination of subsections (A) and (B) must be weighed together to determine if the whistleblowing employee has met her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> burden of showing that the protected disclosure was "a contributing factor." If a whistleblower demonstrates both that the deciding official knew of the disclosure and that the removal action was initiated within a reasonable time of that disclosure, no further nexus need be shown, and no countervailing evidence may negate the petitioner's showing. The burden of persuasion thus shifts to the agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence, a higher standard, that it would have taken the action even in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2). Evidence such as responsiveness to the suggestions in a protected disclosure or lack of animus against petitioner may form part of such a rebuttal case. Such evidence is not, however, relevant to a petitioner's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under section 1221(e)(1)(A) and (B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that allowing whistleblowers to establish their <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case simply by filing protected disclosures only a short period of time before their removal will mean probationary employees doing a substandard job will become permanent employees. We disagree. Once the whistleblower has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under section 1221(e)(1), the agency, pursuant to section 1221(e)(2), may then prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have removed the employee anyway. Furthermore, Congress explicitly addressed this argument when it originally promulgated the WPA. It explained its reason for heightening the agency's standard of proof to clear and convincing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Committee does not intend that employees who are poor performers escape sanction by manufacturing a claim of whistleblowing; at the same time, whistleblowers must not be discouraged by agencies being able to use any possible flaw in an employee's work record as an excuse for retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 100-413, at 15 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we require the Board and its AJs to weigh the deciding official's knowledge of the protected disclosure in combination with the reasonable time period, without more, to determine whether that protected disclosure is a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress did not state a specific period of time under subsection (B), and did not "give the Board the authority to define a specific time period for all cases." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 14. We, likewise, do not state a specific period of time for all cases. Congress did suggest, however, that "an action taken within the same performance evaluation period would normally be considered within a 'reasonable time.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In fact, Congress has given clear guidance to the Board to "use this reasonable time standard liberally." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Kewley asserts on appeal that the AJ erred in finding against her on subsection (B) because in order to satisfy that subsection she only needed to show that the personnel action occurred within a reasonable time of when she made the protected disclosure. We agree. Here the time lapse was only six weeks, well within her performance evaluation period as a probationary employee of one year, expiring in the fall of 1994. She further contends that, once the reasonable time showing had been made, it was error for the AJ to rely on the agency's evidence to determine that the disclosure was <span class="Italic">not</span> a contributing factor. We agree. Although the AJ found that the personnel action was initiated within a month and a half of the protected disclosure, he credited other agency evidence in finding that that time period was not dispositive of whether the disclosure was a contributing factor. Because section 1221(e)(1) guarantees that the employee establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case simply by demonstrating that the knowledge <span class="Italic">and</span> reasonable time requirements were met, and because the agency's affirmative defense under section 1221(e)(2) requires a higher burden of proof, we hold that the AJ's causation finding that Ms. Kewley's protected disclosure was not "a contributing factor" was legally erroneous as contrary to the statutory command as correctly construed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After an employee establishes that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the agency must prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action to remove the employee, even in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 284. In this case, even though the AJ erred in his holding as to section 1221 (e)(1)(B), he expressly found an alternative basis for denying Ms. Kewley relief; after assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the AJ further held that the agency did prove by clear and convincing evidence on the record that it would have removed Ms. Kewley, even in the absence of her disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the agency's only litigable basis to support Ms. Kewley's removal for unsatisfactory work performance, based on her resistance to participating in child abuse cases, was supported on the record by three significant sources of evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the finder of fact, the AJ is in a unique position to evaluate the evidence on the record before him....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we need not decide if each of these three pieces of evidence, by itself, could have constituted clear and convincing proof of independent causation, we do hold that taken together, they could have, and the AJ's finding to that effect is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One additional argument raised by the petitioner is that her status as a probationary employee should not have affected her right as a whistleblower to challenge her removal to the Board as retaliatory. Ms. Kewley argues that the AJ's statement that he had a limited scope of review in addressing her removal was used to lower the agency's burden of proving that it would have fired her, even in the absence of the protected disclosure. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a probationary employee Ms. Kewley's right to obtain Board review of the agency's removal decision is restricted by statute and regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511 (1994); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b) (1998). In fact, the only type of Board review a probationary employee is entitled to is an IRA arising under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221, which is based upon a prohibited personnel practice as described in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (1994), here retaliation. Beyond the allegations brought under such an IRA, however, the Board may not address the merits of the agency's removal action against a probationary employee other than on the narrow grounds, not applicable here, of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806 (1998) (appeal permitted when adverse action was based on marital status, partisan political reasons, or certain pre-employment conditions). Because of these statutory and regulatory restrictions, the AJ is required to narrow the scope of his review to address only the IRA allegations. That is all the cited statement did and hence it could not be error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though Ms. Kewley was a probationary employee and the AJ had a limited scope of review, the agency was still required by statute to meet the burden of proof of clear and convincing evidence, set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2), and was required to show that it would have discharged Ms. Kewley, even in the absence of her protected disclosure. Because the AJ properly limited his scope of review to only the whistleblower allegations, reasonably considered all the evidence of record, and found on the basis of substantial evidence that the agency demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Kewley resisted becoming involved in child abuse investigations, we hold that he acted correctly.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail on a claim under the WPA, an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that his disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). One way to establish this criterion is the knowledge-timing test, under which an employee submits evidence showing that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mason v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its cross petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant proved that his February 2007 Super Bowl pool disclosure was a contributing factor in its decisions to give the appellant an unacceptable rating on his FY 2009 performance evaluation and to remove him in 2010. To support its position, the agency cites <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 16 (2011), in which the Board held that personnel actions taken within 1 to 2 years of the protected disclosure satisfy the timing prong of the knowledge-timing test, and <span class="Italic">Salinas v. Department of the Army</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 10 (2003), in which the Board found that the demotion action took place more than 2 years after Salinas's protected disclosure, and therefore the timing was too remote to satisfy the knowledge-timing test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19-20. Although we agree with the agency's reading of these cases, we find they are distinguishable from the case presently before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike <span class="Italic">Salinas</span> and other IRA cases in which personnel actions, independent of one another, were taken more than 2 years after the protected disclosure, this case involves related performance-based actions that form one continuous chain as the appellant alleges, or in other words a continuum. The Board has considered whether a personnel action that occurred more than 2 years after a protected disclosure was made was "part of a continuum of related personnel actions" in analyzing whether the knowledge-timing test applied. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Interior</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 666, 697 (1997) (considering whether the appellant's non-selection for a promotion in 1995, approximately 6 years after his protected disclosure, was "part of a continuum of related personnel actions" in analyzing whether the knowledge-timing test applied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, each of the performance based actions at issue in this IRA appeal flow from the appellant's unacceptable performance rating for FY 2008. It is undisputed that the agency issued the unacceptable performance rating for FY 2008 within 2 years of the appellant's February 2007 disclosure about the Super Bowl pool, and therefore the issuance of the appellant's FY 2008 performance evaluation occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the unacceptable performance rating. <span class="Italic">See Peterson</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 16. The appellant's unacceptable FY 2008 performance rating directly led to the denial of a WIGI and the decision to place the appellant on a PIP in February 2009. The appellant's subsequent failure to perform at an acceptable level while on the PIP led to the appellant's unacceptable performance rating for FY 2009, and the agency's decision to propose and ultimately remove the appellant in 2010. Thus, although the FY 2009 performance evaluation and the 2010 removal action were taken more than 2 years after the appellant made his Super Bowl pool disclosure in February 2007, they are part of a continuum of related performance-based actions that commenced in December 2008. Consequently, we find that the timing prong of the knowledge-timing test has been satisfied with regard to all of the performance based actions alleged by the appellant. Thus, we AFFIRM the administrative judge's contributing factor findings regarding the performance related actions.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Timing can work against the appellant.

Based on this circumstantial evidence, we find that a reasonable person could not conclude that the appellant's protected activity was a contributing factor in his retirement, and, therefore, he failed to make the necessary nonfrivolous allegations to establish the Board's jurisdiction over his IRA appeal.").

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Veneziano v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 189 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 1999), suggested that the timing test was inapplicable to a RIF involving, in addition to appellant, seven people within an organization:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In rejecting Veneziano's claim under the Whistleblower Protection Act, the administrative judge ruled that she had not shown either of the necessary elements under that Act: she had shown neither a protected disclosure nor that the adverse action against her was taken in retaliation for that disclosure. We need not consider the first of these rulings, however, since Veneziano has not established that her selection for removal under the reduction in force was made in retaliation for her disclosures that the Department was not complying with Circular A-131.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In attempting to show that her disclosures were a "contributing factor" to the adverse action against her--the statutory standard for determining whether the action was retaliatory, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)--Veneziano relies upon the allegedly short time between the disclosure and her notice of removal and the knowledge of that disclosure[] by Tavares, who played an important role in deciding what positions would be eliminated, as establishing that the disclosures were contributing factors. The Act provides that "[t]he employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--(A) the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure; and (B) the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the usual whistleblowing case, where individualized adverse action is taken against an employee within a short time of the protected disclosure, depending upon the circumstances it may be reasonable to infer cause and effect. In the present case, however, the alleged shortness of the interval between the disclosures and the removal resulted from the timing of the reduction in force itself and not its implementation against Veneziano. Since Veneziano does not challenge the reduction in force, but only its application to her, her causation claim based on temporal proximity necessarily fails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the government refuted Veneziano's causal claim. The administrative judge stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Tavares and other agency officials testified that positions were selected for abolishment based on the projected workload requirements. The appellant's position was one of four general engineer positions selected for abolishment. After the selections had been made, the personnel office determined how the incumbents of the selected positions would be affected. Because Tavares did not have knowledge of whether the appellant would exercise assignment rights or be separated by [the reduction in force], he did not have the opportunity to target the appellant for separation.... I conclude that appellant has not met her burden of proving that her disclosures were a contribut[ing] factor in the [reduction in force].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge did not explicitly determine that Tavares and the other agency officials were credible witnesses, that finding was implicit in her acceptance of their testimony. This testimony refutes Veneziano's contention that her disclosures were a contributing factor to the adverse action against her.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1995), recognized the significance of the 1994 amendments to the WPA, yet the court noted that if an agency initiates an action before a protected disclosure, the agency rebuts the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that may be established when the agency decision on the action is issued shortly after the protected disclosure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, [510 U.S. 1091], 114 S. Ct. 920, 127 L. Ed.2d 214 (1994), this court held that the circumstantial evidence of an adverse personnel action taken soon after a protected disclosure was made, was insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. <span class="Italic">Clark</span> was expressly overruled by Act of Congress, effective October 29, 1994, in Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 14, codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)(A) and (B).... Thus the circumstantial evidence of knowledge of the protected disclosure and a reasonable relationship between the time of the protected disclosure and the time of the personnel action will establish, <span class="Italic">prima facie</span>, that the disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action. Although the Board's decision was made before <span class="Italic">Clark</span> was overruled, we apply the law as it now stands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It was established that the action to remove Mr. Horton was initiated on May 16, the day before the May 17 letter was written. Mr. Horton admitted that he knew that disciplinary action was being taken, when he made the May 17 disclosure. Since the May 17 disclosure can not have been a contributing factor to the action already initiated, this requirement of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1) was not met. The Board's denial of Mr. Horton's individual right of action appeal from the separation during his probationary period at El Toro must be affirmed.</p>
