<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-58"><span class="space">e.</span> Challenge to Performance Appraisal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Retention standing in a competitive level depends in part on service credit, and service credit is determined in part by performance appraisals. An appellant may seek to challenge her release from a competitive level by an assertion that a performance appraisal should have been at a higher level. For the employee who claims entitlement to additional service credit for an outstanding rating, the Board examines rating procedures to determine if the appellant was denied a higher rating in violation of agency regulations; however, the employee must show that curing the regulatory error would have resulted in a higher rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Oxley v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 24 MSPR 398, 401 (1984) (SES RIF: a rating was improper and a RIF deficient because the appraisal on its face had no correlation to the appellant's existing performance elements and standards); <span class="Italic">Sutton v. DHHS</span>, 19 MSPR 512, 514-15 (1984) (rejecting appellant's arguments concerning procedural improprieties as to the level of her appraisal); <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v. USDA</span>, 19 MSPR 97, 98-99 (1984) (dispute over whether an employee could receive an upward adjustment of service credit under OPM regulations involving performance ratings at levels from satisfactory to outstanding); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Veneziano v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 189 F.3d 1363, 1367-68 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (agency properly interpreted its appraisal regulations to require an appraisal period of 90 days; the regulation did not require that the rater be the appellant's supervisor for 90 days; a lack of an advisory rating for prior service was not harmful error).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board receives simultaneous or joined appeals claiming an improper performance rating led to an improper RIF, the Board first considers the appeal from the rating and then ascertain whether the appellant's RIF rights were adversely affected by that rating. <span class="Italic">Veal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 66, 68-69 (1991) (RIF and ALOC appeal joined). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-235.html#sec1-232">Performance Standard; Rating; PIP</a>," concerning jurisdiction over challenges to performance ratings.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency procedures applied during RIFs are supposed to be uniformly and consistently applied under 5 CFR 351.201(c) (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grier v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 944 (Fed. Cir. 1984) [discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-043.html#sec10-44">Defined</a>," under "<a href="0100-2023-17-050.html#sec10-51">Competitive Level</a>"]. The agency acts improperly if it provides unscheduled performance appraisals for some employees, resulting in enhanced service credit, but denies other employees the same appraisal opportunities. The agency has the burden of proof to show that RIF regulations were properly applied. If there is a lack of uniformity in appraisal procedures, the appellant's RIF is invalid; he need not demonstrate that his appraisal would have been helpful if one had been undertaken. <span class="Italic">Phelps v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 30, 31-32 (1984). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 680 (1990), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To demonstrate the uniform application of appraisal procedures, the agency should show through affidavits or testimony that in constructing retention registers it considered the performance rating of record of each employee on the date of the specific notice and that any additional service credit was correctly credited to the employees. The employee may then show that others improperly received added service credit or that he was improperly denied it. He should show the effect on his retention standing. The Board determines if the agency abused its discretion in establishing and consistently implementing the performance standards at issue. Timing and propriety of challenged ratings will be reviewed. But the Board will not review the merits and substance of a performance rating, and an agency cannot be ordered to correct a rating. The Board's role is to assure that the employee was given the right to determination of service credit entitlement consistent with the agency appraisal system. However, the Board also concludes that, even though it is without jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal from a rating, evidence that the rating was improperly awarded on the merits, if prejudicial to the appellant, may be relevant to show that the RIF was a prohibited personnel practice, <span class="Italic">Haataja v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 594, 601-05 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's invocation of the RIF regulations determines only the nature of an employee's entitlements under the RIF regulations. It does not necessarily limit the Board's authority to examine the propriety of <span id="Page_3066"></span>the entire RIF action under the provisions of 5 USC Section 7701. Thus, the Board's adjudication of an agency's RIF action not only embraces the effectuation of the action in accordance with Part 351 regulations but includes such review of any other relevant provision of law, regulations or negotiated procedures as circumstances warrant. <span class="Italic">Adakai v. Department of the Interior</span>, 20 MSPR 196, 201 (1984). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 20 MSPR 713, 716-17 (1984). The agency's "RIF decision" not only embraces the requirement that the Part 351 regulations be properly applied to appellant, but also that the procedural or operational provisions of the agency's performance appraisal system, established under 5 CFR Part 430, subpart B, be applied consistently in determining each employee's entitlement to additional service credit for performance under 5 CFR Section 351.504. Accordingly, the agency's decision to effect a RIF action against an employee necessarily includes a review of whether the agency ensured that additional service credit for performance accorded to employees under 5 CFR Section 351.504 is consistent with 5 CFR Part 430, subpart B, and the procedures of the agency's performance appraisal system established thereunder, and that the agency's determination of each employee's entitlement to additional service credit is consistently applied in any one RIF. By this we mean that the agency need not show that a performance rating awarded was warranted on the merits; but that the agency must show that its determination of each employee's entitlement to additional service credit for performance constitutes a consistent application of the procedural or operational provisions of its performance appraisal system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case on this element of its decision by coming forward with affidavits or testimony showing that in constructing the retention register it considered the performance rating of record of each employee, including the appellant's, on the date of issuance of the specific RIF notice and that any additional service credit was correctly accorded based thereon in determining each employee's retention standing. If the appellant presents no rebuttal evidence to challenge the propriety of the agency's determination of each employee's entitlement to additional service credit for performance under section 351.504, the agency's initial evidence will normally suffice to meet the agency's burden of persuasion on this element of its decision. Once the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence shifts to the appellant, but the burden of persuasion never shifts from the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Losure</span>, 2 MSPR at 201-02. In challenging the propriety of the agency's determination of its employees' retention standing the appellant must identify an employee or employees in his competitive level who have a later service date than the appellant and who he believes were improperly accorded additional service credit for performance, or that he, the appellant, was improperly denied additional service credit under Section 351.504. The appellant, further, must show that such improper action affected his retention standing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Certain Former Community Services Administration Employees v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 379, 393-94 (1984); <span class="Italic">Debold v. Department of the Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 455, 458 (1982); <span class="Italic">Aronson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 10, 13 (1980). Once the appellant has made such a rebuttal presentation, the agency may present evidence to refute the contentions made or show that the appellant's substantive right to a consistent application of the agency's determination of each employee's entitlement to additional service credit in a RIF under Section 351.504 has not been abridged by showing that, notwithstanding the evidence, the appellant would have been released from his competitive level in any event. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 19 MSPR 97 (1984) (where the Board held that since the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had not approved the agency's performance appraisal system at the time the appellant's RIF was effected, she was not entitled to receive an additional two years of service credit under 5 CFR Section 351.504 (1980) for a performance rating between "satisfactory" and "outstanding"; moreover, any upward adjustment of her service credit for RIF purposes would not affect her substantive rights since she was properly reached for release from her competitive level, because she was not qualified for positions offered to employees with less retention standing). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Speaker v. Department of Education</span>, 13 MSPR 163, 165-66 (1982); <span class="Italic">Foster v. Department of Transportation</span>, 8 MSPR 240, 244-45 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In refuting the specific allegations of error regarding the appellant's right to a consistent determination of each employee's entitlement to additional service credit for performance under Section 351.504, the agency should show that it has implemented a performance appraisal system meeting all the requirements of 5 CFR Part 430, subpart B. The Board concludes that the circumstances warrant that the scope of our review of an appellant's allegation that the agency improperly established or implemented its performance appraisal system under 5 CFR Part 430, subpart B, so as to affect his substantive right to a consistent determination of each employee's entitlement to additional service credit for performance under 5 CFR Section 351.504, is limited to determining whether the agency abused its discretion in establishing and implementing consistently the performance provisions at issue so as to prejudice the RIF rights of the appellant. In this regard, the Board will review the timing and propriety of performance ratings that are challenged by an appellant who is affected by a RIF action to determine whether the agency showed that it reasonably exercised its discretion in establishing and implementing consistently the procedural or operational performance provisions at issue. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 19 MSPR 512 (1984) (where the Board found that the agency complied with the procedural provisions of its performance appraisal system in rating the appellant's performance "satisfactory" rather than "outstanding," so that she was properly denied four additional years of service credit for the higher rating under 5 CFR Section 351.504 (b)(2)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is mindful that there is no statutory or regulatory basis for an appeal of a performance rating to the Board<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Tillery v. Department of Defense</span>, 2 MSPR 482 (1980); <span class="Italic">Marsh v. Department of the Army</span>, 1 MSPR 736 (1980). In making our determination whether the agency showed that additional service credit for performance was properly accorded to each employee under 5 CFR Section 351.504, the Board does not assume jurisdiction over appeals of performance ratings. The Board will not review the management considerations which underlie the proper exercise of agency discretion concerning the merits and substance of a performance rating. The Board, further, cannot order an agency to effect corrective action of a performance rating. The Board merely reviews the agency's determination of each employee's entitlement to additional service credit toward retention standing to assure that the appellant was afforded his substantive RIF right under 5 CFR Section 351.504 to a determination of entitlement to such service credit in a RIF action consistent with the procedures of the agency's performance appraisal system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board is without jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal of a performance rating, evidence that such a rating was improperly awarded on the merits and substance of the appraisal and prejudiced the appellant's retention standing in a RIF action may be relevant and material to establishing an allegation that the RIF action was based on a prohibited personnel practice in violation of one or more of the provisions of 5 USC Section 2302(b). An allegation of such a prohibited personnel practice in a RIF appeal constitutes an affirmative defense which the appellant must plead, and prove by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Etter v. Department of Defense</span>, 14 MSPR 367 (1983) (an allegation that the RIF action was based on sexual discrimination must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence); <span class="Italic">Shockro v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 5 MSPR 113, 116 (1981) (an allegation that the RIF action was effected in retaliation for protected "whistleblowing" must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence). Thus, the Board may properly consider an appellant's allegation and evidence that a performance rating was improperly awarded on the merits of the appraisal and prejudiced his retention standing in a RIF action, if it is relevant to proving an affirmative defense of a violation of the provisions of 5 USC Section 2302(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit applied <span class="Italic">Haataja</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in <span class="Italic">Woodward v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3180):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To challenge the Navy's application of performance standards before the Board, Mr. Woodward was required to identify an employee or employees in his competitive level who have a later service computation date than himself and who he believes were improperly accredited additional service credit for performance, or that he was improperly denied additional service credit. Additionally, he must show that this affected his retention standing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Federal Circuit discouraged collateral litigation over performance appraisals in the course of RIF appeals, concluding in <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 92-3500), as to a dispute concerning the scope of hearing evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he board was not required to subpoena the 13 witnesses that petitioner had requested because petitioner had not shown that the testimony they would give was material or relevant to the merits of the RIF action. Petitioner claimed that the witnesses would testify about alleged favoritism against petitioner that resulted in an unfair and lowered performance rating for her, and about the grievance she had filed against her superior. This testimony was not relevant to the issues of whether there was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> RIF, or whether the RIF procedure and the procedures of the agency's performance system were properly followed. It appears that petitioner was attempting by this evidence to have the board review her performance rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board has held that where a RIF is undertaken for valid purposes and in accordance with RIF procedures, the board will not review the substance and merits of an employee's performance rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Haataja v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 594 (1985); <span class="Italic">Tillery v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 3 MSPB 6[2 MSPR 482] (1980). We agree, because an unfavorable performance rating is not an adverse action that is appealable to the board under the provisions of 5 USC 7512, 7513, and 7701 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner was not without a remedy, however, if she wished to <span id="Page_3067"></span>challenge her lowered performance rating. As pointed out by the respondent, she could have obtained review of her performance rating through the administrative grievance procedures established by the Navy...through Equal Employment Opportunity procedures...or through the negotiated grievance procedures applicable to the bargaining unit....&#8197;Instead, she impermissibly sought review of the merits of her performance rating through the board. The board is without jurisdiction to give her any relief on this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee asserts that a performance rating was due to him prior to the date of issuance of the specific RIF notice, the agency must show that it reasonably and consistently followed the provisions of its appraisal system in scheduling performance ratings and maintaining the ratings on record. <span class="Italic">Mazzola v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 682 (1985). If an agency makes an error in assigning a rating and maintains that the employee's rating should have been lower, it appears that the correction must be made before the issuance of the specific notice of a RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Waddell v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 328, 329 (1984). Should the employee claim an error in his rating, the RIF will not be set aside for the agency error in the application of its appraisal system if the agency can demonstrate that even with proper ratings and enhanced competitive standing, an employee could not have displaced the employees in the positions desired. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 680, 686 (1990); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cornyn v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 96 Fed. Appx. 678, 681 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (implying that an OPM-approved appraisal system is not an absolute prerequisite to a valid RIF).</p>
