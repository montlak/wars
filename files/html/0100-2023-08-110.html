<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-109"><span class="space">a.</span> Pre- and Postappointment Distinctions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Should the employee be terminated for both pre- and postappointment conditions, the employee has the greater procedural protections associated with the preappointment condition termination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 388, 393-94 (1994). Conversely, under <span class="Italic">Sonet v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 2 MSPR 552, 553, 3 MSPB 73 (1980), if the employee's performance or conduct after appointment is the cause for termination, the greater procedural protections attaching to terminations based on preappointment reasons are not required. An employee was properly terminated for postappointment performance even though the employee alleged that the performance problems were caused by conditions that developed before his appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cohen v. United States</span>, 384 F.2d 1001 (Ct. Cl. 1967); <span class="Italic">McCloud v. Dept. of <span id="Page_159"></span>Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 643, 646 (1987) (termination for conduct or performance after an appointment is a termination for a postappointment reason). Under those circumstances, the probationer is terminated for a current failing, not a past condition. <span class="Italic">Garvin v. USDA</span>, 5 MSPR 204, 206, 5 MSPB 255 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cox v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 52, 52 n.* (1986) (although the appellant was terminated for the loss of his commission, and the commission was revoked because of a prior criminal conviction, the termination of employment was based on the current loss of the commission, not the past criminal problem); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Sproles v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-315H-14-0289-I-1 (NP 12/10/2014) ("However, although the appellant was involved in the contract work before she was appointed, her involvement in that position after her appointment constituted post-appointment activity."); <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, DC-315H-12-0802-I-1 (NP 8/14/2013) (investigation showed alleged misconduct while the appellant was a contractor and then as an employee; without much analysis the Board concluded the action was not for preappointment reasons because some alleged misconduct occurred during the period of his employment and the termination letter did not refer to preappointment allegations); cf. Smith v. VA, NY-315H-16-0230-I-1 (NP 4/15/2022) ("The appellant also claims on review that his termination is unsubstantiated because the criminal charges stemming from his misconduct have been dismissed. Such a claim is insufficient to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction because it is irrelevant to the question of whether the appellant has a statutory or regulatory basis for Board jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Termination of a probationer was for postappointment reasons when an employment inquiry, an OF-306 form the employee submitted before appointment and again signed after appointment, contained inaccurate or incomplete information as to prior criminal convictions, <span class="Italic">Younies v. Dept. of Labor,</span> SF-315H-10-0492-I-1 (NP 9/30/2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Younies v. MSPB</span>, 662 F.3d 1215 (Fed. Cir. 2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant reiterates his contention from below, that the agency was required to follow the procedures of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805, because his termination was related to a pre-employment issue, his answer to question 9 on the Optional Form (OF) 306 regarding prior criminal convictions. He asserts that he answered question 9 before his appointment, and that signing the OF 306 a second time, on November 9, 2009, after his appointment, does not convert his omission of his conviction into a strictly post-employment matter. The appellant also argues that the OF 306 is inherently a pre-employment document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion, however, that the agency terminated the appellant for his post-appointment signing of the OF 306. This conclusion is supported by both the termination notice, which cited the appellant's signature on the OF 306 on November 9, 2009, after his appointment, and the legal authority given on the Standard Form 50 executing the termination, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804, which sets forth the procedure for terminating probationary employees for unsatisfactory performance or conduct.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant cites <span class="Italic">Milanak v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Younies v. MSPB</span>, 662 F.3d 1215, 1219-20 (Fed. Cir. 2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Our jurisdictional analysis thus reduces to determining whether substantial evidence supports the MSPB's determination that Mr. Younies was not entitled to the procedures of &#x00A7; 315.805--that is, whether he was not terminated based in whole or in part on a pre-probationary condition. <span class="Italic">Cf. Langer v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 265 F.3d 1259, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We hold that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What may potentially complicate our jurisdictional analysis is that Mr. Younies signed the application form twice, once before employment and once during employment. Mr. Younies urges us to view the two signatures as part of a single event that occurred (or at least started to occur) before he was employed. He points out that he answered the questions in the application form only before employment, and argues that notwithstanding his second signature, the failure to disclose the conviction pre-dated his employment. We disagree. Each time Mr. Younies signed the form, he "certif[ied] that, to the best of [his] knowledge and belief, all of the information on [the form] is true, correct, complete, and made in good faith." The initial certification was made by Mr. Younies as an "Applicant"; the second was made by Mr. Younies as an "Appointee." Thus, for the purpose of our analysis, the first and second signatures constitute separate events.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is it material, in our view, that the two misrepresentations are based on the same underlying facts (Mr. Younies's criminal history). We of course observe that once the Department of Labor knew about the second misrepresentation, it also inevitably knew about the first. But Mr. Younies does not provide any authority that suggests that the second misrepresentation necessarily "relates back" to the first. On the contrary, the MSPB has long held that an employer's reliance on a condition that originates in the employee's pre-employment history--and yet continues to exist during the probationary period--does not necessarily trigger the pre-probationary procedural requirements of &#x00A7; 315.805. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Van Doneen v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 33 MSPR 420, 423 (1987) (holding that an employee's dismissal based on his failure to maintain security clearance was not a pre-probationary reason, even though security clearance was denied due to the employee's pre-employment history), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1098 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (unpublished table decision); <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 114 MSPR 52, 55 (2010) (holding that failure to obtain a credit card was not a pre-probationary reason, even though the employee's poor credit history predated employment). The MSPB's refusal to "relate back" the reasons for termination to when they first came into existence is supported by the structure of the pertinent regulatory scheme and grounded in sound policy. Section 315.806(c) provides a right to appeal to pre-probationary employees who are terminated based on pre-probationary reasons; yet it does not confer the same right upon an employee who is terminated because his "work performance or conduct during [the probationary] period fails to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804(a). We agree with the MSPB, therefore, that we must "distinguish between a preexisting condition and the effect that condition has on an employee's performance." <span class="Italic">Van Doneen</span>, 33 MSPR at 423. And, as the MSPB has aptly noted, "tracing back [an employee's] performance deficiency to a pre-appointment condition[ ] could possibly transform almost every separation of a probationer into a case involving a condition arising before appointment." Thus, to the extent that Mr. Younies invites us to relate the second misrepresentation to the first as a matter of law merely because the misrepresentations were based on the same underlying facts, we decline the invitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having so framed the inquiry, our analysis must focus on determining whether substantial evidence supports the MSPB's determination that the Department of Labor relied solely on the second misrepresentation, not the first. Based on the record before us, we have no difficulty in holding that it does. The termination letter expressly mentions the second date on which Mr. Younies signed the application form and makes no mention of the first. The termination letter also points to Mr. Younies's persistence in maintaining that he had never been convicted, even after the Department of Labor brought his criminal record to his attention. The termination letter also notes that Mr. Younies's misrepresentation regarding his criminal record undermined his ability to perform certain aspects of the job, particularly adjudicating disputes that may arise out of background investigations of the Department of Labor's personnel. Substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion, therefore, that the Department of Labor terminated Mr. Younies's employment not based on a pre-probationary reason as defined under &#x00A7; 315.805, but based on the determination that his "conduct during [the probationary] period fail[ed] to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804(a); <span class="Italic">see also Van Doneen</span>, 33 MSPR at 423.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Younies argues that his conviction was expunged under California law, and that he did not misrepresent the facts in the first place. The problem is, however, that Mr. Younies has only invoked &#x00A7; 315.806(c) as the source of jurisdiction for the MSPB, and the MSPB's jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 315.806(c) is limited to examining whether Mr. Younies received the process that was due under the regulations, not whether the substance of the employment decision was correct. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(c); <span class="Italic">see also Hope v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 108 MSPR 6, 10 (2008). Our jurisdictional inquiry is thus similarly narrow in scope because Mr. Younies may not create jurisdiction through assertions that are not reviewable on appeal. Moreover, we see no factual basis in the record for Mr. Younies's argument that the Department of Labor's stated justification is a ruse to circumvent the procedural safeguards of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. Indeed, the Department of Labor already provided Mr. Younies with most of what he would have been entitled to under &#x00A7; 315.805 by giving him advance notice of the allegations (albeit not in writing), an opportunity to respond (of which Mr. Younies availed himself), and a written explanation of the reasons for termination. <span class="Italic">Cf. id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, in order for Mr. Younies to successfully invoke &#x00A7; 315.806(c) as the source of the MSPB's jurisdiction, he must point to sufficient facts in the record that would amount to a nonfrivolous assertion that the Department of Labor actually relied on a pre-employment condition in terminating his employment. Because substantial evidence supports the MSPB's determination that Mr. Younies has failed to do so, we must affirm the MSPB's dismissal of Mr. Younies's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant was terminated for failing to disclose on his OF-306 that he was delinquent on a Federal debt. The <span id="Page_160"></span>administrative judge found that, although the appellant had certified the same OF-306 both as an applicant on March 25, 2015, and as an appointee on April 20, 2015, he was terminated for post-appointment conduct because the agency's termination letter relied only on his post-appointment certification, which occurred on or after his appointment on April 19, 2015. In so finding, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Pashayev v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 544 F. App'x 1006, 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2013), and <span class="Italic">Younies v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that <span class="Italic">Pashayev</span> and <span class="Italic">Younies</span> are factually distinct because they involved employees who knew the information they provided on their declarations was false, whereas he unintentionally provided false information.[5] Such an argument, however, goes to the merits of the agency's decision to terminate him, which is beyond the scope of the Board's review and not relevant to the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hope v.

Pashayev argues that, despite his disclosure of his earlier termination, Interior still hired him and, as a result, cannot now fire him for withholding that same information. This argument misinterprets Interior's rationale behind the termination. As stated in the Notice, Pashayev was fired for submitting false information on the November 22 Declaration, one day after the commencement of his employment on November 21. As such, his disclosure does not qualify as a pre-employment action or condition that would bring his claim under &#x00A7; 315.806(c). <span class="Italic">Younies v. Merit Sys.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the appellant contended that her termination was based on conditions arising before her appointment because a memorandum from her supervisor to the division director recommending her termination for failure to demonstrate acceptable performance during her probationary period also referred to her supervisor's concerns about hiring the appellant due to her lack of certain prior work experience. Specifically, her supervisor noted that, even though a panel of senior scientists had recommended the appellant for the position, she had concerns about hiring her because the appellant had no peer-reviewed first author publications, no HIV-related publications, only one HIV-related poster presentation and HIV-related oral presentation, and no peer-reviewed publications in any subject matter since 1996. According to the appellant's supervisor, she discussed these limitations with the appellant's references and, despite these limitations, decided to hire the appellant and use the probationary period to determine her fitness for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find unavailing the appellant's claim that the agency's reference to pre-appointment concerns about hiring her for the position in spite of her lack of certain qualifications shows that the agency terminated her based on conditions arising pre-appointment. Notwithstanding its concerns regarding the appellant's prior experience, the agency hired the appellant and properly used the probationary period to determine her ability to perform the job duties of the position.[3] Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the record reflects that the agency did not terminate the appellant due to the noted shortcomings in her prior experience but, rather, because of her poor performance during her probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant argues that there are policy reasons why there should be broader appeal rights for probationary employees. However, probationary employees are purposely afforded limited appeal rights to keep the civil service free from prohibited personnel practices while also ensuring that agencies can utilize the probationary period to determine whether an appointment should become final. Office of Policy and Evaluation, U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, The Probationary Period: A Critical Assessment Opportunity, i-ii (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as the administrative judge correctly found, the Board distinguishes between a pre-existing condition and the effect that condition has on an employee's performance during her probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Von Deneen v.

Even if the appellant's lack of prior experience were an indirect factor in the termination decision, it only would be because of its effect on her post-appointment performance and thus would not constitute a pre-appointment reason. <span class="Italic">See Rivera v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 52, &#x00B6; 8 (2010) (even assuming that the appellant's failure to qualify for a credit card was attributable to his pre-appointment credit history, his termination for failure to secure approval for a government credit card nonetheless would constitute a post-appointment reason for termination); <span class="Italic">see also Cunningham v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 107, 109-10 (1986) (attendance problem caused by pre-existing medical condition is a post-appointment reason for termination).

<p class="Body-Text">The refusal to work overtime was a postappointment problem. <span class="Italic">Allen v. USPS</span> (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Allen held the position of Part-time Flexible Letter Carrier and was removed for failure to meet the attendance requirements of that position. Specifically, Allen refused to work on various Saturdays for which he was scheduled to work. Allen, a Seventh Day Adventist, believes that he should not work on Saturdays. The Postal Service, which was aware of Allen's religious beliefs before offering him the position, was generally accommodating.

Allen claims that the Postal Service's knowledge of his religious beliefs automatically gives rise to such a pre-existing condition. However, the record shows that Allen was not fired for his religious beliefs (the pre-existing condition), but rather for practicing them and missing work, despite being warned that the Postal Service would not always be able to accommodate his preference. To allow Allen to maintain this claim would be contrary to the undisputed facts and would circumvent the clear language of the regulation that religious discrimination claims cannot stand on their own. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(d) (referring to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 535.806(b) and (c).)</p>

On the other hand, situations which do not involve the performance or conduct of the employee after appointment, do not come within the purposes for which the probationary period was created, and the employees affected are treated is if their positions were permanent.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[O]ne of our predecessor courts has held that the pre-appointment conditions contemplated by section 315.805 do not include pre-appointment physical conditions. <span class="Italic">See Cohen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that the board did not err in determining that Pierce did not meet the prerequisites for a probationary employee's right to appeal.

<p class="Body-Text">The problem of distinguishing between preappointment and postappointment causes for removal of probationers was explored in <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 33 MSPR 420, 422-23 (1987). The appellant was terminated during probation because he lost his security clearance. The clearance was denied because he had relatives living in a communist-controlled country. Termination was for a postappointment condition, i.e., current loss of a security clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he reason for the agency's action--denial of a security clearance <span id="Page_162"></span>based on relatives living in a communist-controlled country--is a post-appointment reason...because, in essence, it is a charge that the appellant did not meet the requirements of his position during his probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we distinguish between a pre-existing condition and the effect that condition has on an employee's performance during his probationary period. Although the appellant had relatives living in Czechoslovakia before he was appointed to the position with the Coast Guard, he was removed not because of this pre-existing condition, but because of the effect of this condition during his employment, i.e., the denial of his security clearance. The denial of the security clearance rendered the appellant's performance deficient because it precluded him from performing the duties of his position. Because the appellant was ultimately removed for a performance deficiency, he was removed for a post-appointment reason. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cohen v. United States</span>, 384 F.2d 1001 (Ct. Cl. 1967).... As the court noted in <span class="Italic">Cohen</span>, to accept the appellant's theory, which is essentially a tracing back of his performance deficiency to a pre-appointment condition, could possibly transform almost every separation of a probationer into a case involving conditions arising before appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Von Deneen,</span> the Board found no jurisdiction over a probationer's termination that involved a current failure to be able to work based on a situation with some connection to conditions arising before the individual's employment but that also concerned the appellant's ability to hold a clearance, <span class="Italic">Reyes v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-315H-10-0222-I-1 (NP 9/30/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over her appeal. Although her failure to qualify for access to personally identifiable information systems, based on the Letter of Intent to deny a security clearance, was attributable to her pre-appointment conduct, her termination nonetheless was based on a post-appointment reason. This is because the agency, in essence, charged the appellant with failing to meet the requirements of her position during her probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Rivera v. Department of the Navy,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 52, &#x00B6; 8 (2010); <span class="Italic">Rhone v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 257, 259-60 (1995); <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v.

In that case, the Board recognized that the denial of a security clearance renders the appellant's performance deficient because it precludes him from performing the duties of his position, and "tracing back" a performance deficiency to a pre-appointment condition could possibly transform almost every separation of a probationer into a case involving a condition arising before appointment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>

<p class="Body-Text">Also following <span class="Italic">Von Deneen, supra, Rhone v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 66 MSPR 257, 259-60 (1995), distinguished dismissal for failure to pay a debt incurred before employment and the present failure to pay the debt:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding jurisdiction, the administrative judge stated that the agency terminated the appellant in part for pre-appointment reasons, in that its termination letter specifically referenced the appellant's failure to properly file his 1987 return. As the agency points out, however, its termination notice does not contain the specific reference relied on by the administrative judge. Rather, the agency terminated the appellant because he failed to comply with its earlier directive to pay, or arrange to make installments on, an outstanding 1987 tax liability. The agency found that this failure constituted insubordination and violated its rule of conduct requiring employees to satisfy all just financial obligations, particularly taxes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true, as the administrative judge noted, that the appellant's tax liability predated his employment with the agency. It is necessary, however, to distinguish between a pre-existing condition and the effect that condition has on an employee's performance or conduct during his probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Von Deneen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 MSPR 420, 423, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1098 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Von Deneen</span>, the Board found that the appellant was terminated for post-appointment reasons when the agency removed him after he was denied a security clearance because he had relatives living in Czechoslovakia, then a communist-controlled country. Although the relatives lived in Czechoslovakia before Von Deneen's appointment, the Board found that he was not terminated because of this pre-existing condition, but because of the effect of this condition during his employment. Similarly, the appellant here was not terminated because of the existence of the tax liability before he was hired, but because, during his employment, he did not comply with the agency's directive to satisfy the liability. Indeed, if there is a distinction between Von Deneen's situation and the appellant's, it is that the appellant, apparently unlike Von Deneen, had the opportunity to prevent his pre-existing liability from affecting his employment. Yet, Von Deneen was nevertheless found to have been terminated for post-appointment reasons. In accordance with <span class="Italic">Von Deneen</span> and other precedent, we find that like Von Deneen, the appellant was terminated for post-appointment reasons. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Holloman v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 107 (1986) (attendance problem caused by preexisting medical condition is a post appointment reason for termination). As additional support for our finding, we note that the agency was aware of the appellant's outstanding tax liability, but hired him despite it. It is unlikely that, having hired the appellant with knowledge of his tax debt, the agency would terminate him later because of it. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 48 MSPR 141, 144 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In two recent decisions, on which the administrative judge relied, the Board found that the probationary appellants were in part terminated for pre-appointment reasons. <span class="Italic">See Pope v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 476 (1994); <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 388 (1994). In these cases, however, in contrast to the situation here, the termination notices specifically included pre-appointment conduct as a basis for the removal, in addition to the post-appointment reasons. The agency correctly argues that because the appellant's termination was based solely on post-appointment reasons, <span class="Italic">Pope</span> and <span class="Italic">Jordan</span> do not control the outcome here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to qualify for a government credit card (and the consequential inability to travel for government training) was a postappointment reason for termination, although the credit problems that led to the inability to secure the card may have arisen before the appointment, <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 114 MSPR 52, 55 &#x00B6; 8, 2010 MSPB 87 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over his appeal, and that the administrative judge did not err in declining to hold a hearing in this appeal. The appellant contends that his termination for failure to secure approval for a government credit card constituted a termination for reasons occurring before his appointment because the agency based the denial on his pre-appointment credit history. Even assuming that the appellant's failure to qualify for a credit card was attributable to his pre-appointment credit history, his termination for failure to secure approval for a government credit card nonetheless would constitute a post-appointment reason for termination under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804 because, in essence, the agency charged the appellant with failing to meet the requirements of his position during his probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Rhone v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 257, 259-60 (1995); <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v.

In that case, the Board recognized that the denial of a security clearance renders the appellant's performance deficient because it precludes him from performing the duties of his position, and "tracing back" a performance deficiency to a pre-appointment condition could possibly transform almost every separation of a probationer into a case involving a condition arising before appointment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly here, even if the appellant's failure to qualify for a credit card was attributable to his pre-appointment credit history, he was ultimately terminated for a post-appointment deficiency, i.e., his failure to obtain a government credit card. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. For these reasons, the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous claim that the agency separated him for reasons arising in whole or in part before his appointment, and he therefore has not made a nonfrivolous claim that he was entitled to the procedures provided in 5 <span id="Page_163"></span>C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. The agency's apparent failure to provide him with those procedures accordingly cannot provide a basis for Board jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An allegation that the appellant was terminated in reprisal for EEO activities before his appointment did not establish termination for preappointment conditions when the basis for removal stated by the agency was defective performance during the appointment, <span class="Italic">Jafri v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant is terminated during probation for post-appointment reasons, such as poor performance, or, as here, for failure to meet the training requirements of his position, the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal only if the appellant makes a non-frivolous allegation of discrimination based on partisan political reasons or marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.804, 315.806(b); <span class="Italic">Rhone v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 66 MSPR 257, 260 (1995). It is undisputed that the appellant here did not make even a non-frivolous allegation of such discrimination entitling him to a hearing on the issue. Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal under 5 CFR 315.806(b)<span class="Italic">. See Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685-86 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (once the Board determines that a probationer's allegations of marital status and/or political discrimination are without substance, the appeal will be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Rhone v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 66 MSPR at 260.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, where an agency relies on pre-appointment reasons, or on both pre-appointment and post-appointment reasons in effecting a probationary termination, it must accord the appellant the procedures noted above; i.e., notice, a right to answer and a final decision<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 315.805; <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 388, 394 (1994). An employee may appeal to the Board on the ground that the termination was not effected in accordance with such procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.806(c). In addition, 5 CFR 315.806(d) provides for jurisdiction over complaints of discrimination based upon race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and disability, in connection with a probationary termination, but only if "such discrimination is raised in addition to one of the issues stated in paragraph (b) or (c)." <span class="Italic">See Jordan v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR at 395 (Board jurisdiction attaches under 5 CFR 315.806(d) only if the Board otherwise has jurisdiction over a probationary termination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that his termination was based on retaliation or reprisal for having filed previous discrimination complaints, that such retaliation constitutes a pre-appointment reason for his termination, and that he was not provided the procedures described above. We find, however, that retaliation could not constitute a pre-appointment reason for the appellant's termination because it is covered by the kinds of discrimination detailed in section 315.806(d), which, as detailed above, do not afford a separate basis for Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.103(a); <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 MSPR 451, 457 (1986) (under Title VII's implementing regulations, a federal employee's Title VII rights include freedom from reprisal for exercising EEO complaint rights). Put another way, alleging reprisal for having filed a discrimination complaint prior to appointment does not make reprisal a pre-appointment reason for termination anymore than if an employee is black or disabled prior to appointment and later alleges that such discrimination was the reason for probationary termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the appellant was terminated only for post-appointment reasons and was, therefore, not entitled to the procedures set forth in 5 CFR 315.805. The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's probationary termination because, as detailed above, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's termination under section 315.806(b) or (c) and there is no independent basis for the Board's jurisdiction over a claim of retaliation because such a claim arises under section 315.806(d). Contrary to the administrative judge's assertion, if the Board otherwise had jurisdiction over this appeal, it could decide the appellant's claim of retaliation in connection with its decision concerning the probationary termination<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 315.806(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Tolbert v. SBA</span>, 104 MSPR 418, 421-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 2007 MSPB 9 (2007) (aff'd, 245 Fed. Appx. 964 (Fed. Cir. 2007)), contended that his probationary termination lacked due process because the real reason for the termination was not performance problems but the appellant's prior complaints about lack of priority consideration. The appellant did not request a hearing. The Board evaluated the evidence, considered the shifting burdens of proof on jurisdiction over the appeal--that is, what really motivated the termination--and concluded that the agency's evidence of performance problems outweighed the appellant's evidence, meaning that the termination was not for preappointment reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving Board jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] . As a probationary employee with less than 1 year of current continuous service, the appellant has no statutory right of appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a). Moreover, he did not allege that his termination was based upon either partisan politics or marital status, which would give rise to a regulatory right of appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b). However, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(c), a probationary employee may appeal to the Board on the grounds that the agency terminated his appointment for reasons arising before appointment without complying with the procedural requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. In support of his claim that pre-appointment reasons motivated the agency to terminate his appointment, the appellant provided correspondence, dated prior to his November 18, 2002 appointment, concerning his complaints that he was improperly denied priority consideration. It is undisputed that the agency did not provide the appellant with advance notice of the proposed termination and an opportunity to respond, as would be required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant makes a non-frivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction, he is entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In this case, however, the appellant indicated that he did not want a hearing. Hence, it was appropriate for the administrative judge to determine, based on the written record, whether the appellant satisfied his burden of proving jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In doing so, the administrative judge dismissed summarily the appellant's allegation that his termination was for pre-appointment reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">While the appellant may suspect improper motives behind the agency's stated reasons for his termination, the fact remains that he was hired subject to a probationary period and, on its face, he was terminated for poor performance in his position--a post appointment reason. Thus, he was not entitled to the procedures attendant to a termination based on pre-appointment reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This language suggests that the administrative judge took the agency's stated reason for the termination as sufficient grounds to dismiss the appellant's claim to a right of review under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(c), without considering the evidence offered by the appellant that the termination was in fact based on pre-appointment reasons, proper or otherwise. If so, this was error. Where, as here, an appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that his probationary termination was for pre-appointment reasons, the agency's claim that the termination was for post-appointment reasons is not dispositive of the jurisdictional issue. As with other agency actions, the Board will look to substance rather than form in determining its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dillingham v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 538, 541-43 (1997) (finding that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's withdrawal of an offer was not simply a nonselection, as the agency claimed, but was based on a constructive negative suitability determination within the Board's jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that the appellant's evidence is insufficient to meet his burden of proof, especially when weighed against the evidence indicating that he was, as the agency contends, terminated for post-appointment reasons. This evidence includes the agency's decision letter, dated January 30, 2003, detailing the appellant's performance problems; and the informal counseling letter, dated January 15, 2003, from the appellant's supervisor, J. Michael Cottle, expressing concerns for the appellant's poor performance. Therefore, to the extent that the administrative judge erred in failing to properly weigh the record evidence in assessing the appellant's jurisdictional assertions, his error provides no basis for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984). Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the probationer was terminated for violating a preappointment condition of a criminal probation agreement--discovered by the agency after the employee's appointment--the motivating factor was a preappointment condition, <span class="Italic">LeMaster v. VA</span>, 123 MSPR 453, 455, 457-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 8-14, 2016 MSPB 25 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective November 16, 2014, the appellant received an appointment to the competitive service position of GS-05 Program Support Clerk, subject to a 1-year probationary period. While the appellant was still serving his probationary period, the agency notified him that he would be terminated from his position, effective February 13, 2015, due to "conduct issues" relating to the terms of a June 22, 2007 court-ordered probation agreement that was entered following his release from prison for bank fraud. The agency's termination notice cited the terms of the <span id="Page_164"></span>appellant's probation agreement, which, among other things, required him to inform any employer or prospective employer of his current conviction and supervision status, prohibited him from possessing or using a computer with access to any online computer service without the prior written approval of the court, and prohibited him from possessing or using any public or private data encryption technique or program. The termination notice also stated that, during his employment, the appellant failed to disclose to the agency that his computer access and use was in violation of his probation agreement and that his inability to use the agency's computer system prevented him from performing his job duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that his termination was based, at least in part, on preappointment reasons and he was, therefore, entitled to the procedural requirements set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. The agency's termination letter specifically cites the terms of the appellant's June 22, 2007 court-ordered probation agreement. Both below and on review, the agency has maintained that it terminated the appellant based on the conditions of his probation agreement, as well as on his failure to disclose that such conditions would prevent him from performing his job duties. The agency has argued, however, that the appellant was terminated based on postappointment reasons because his probation agreement was merely a preexisting condition that affected his postappointment performance by preventing him from performing his job duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree and find that the cases that the agency relies upon in support of this argument are distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 420, 423, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1098 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table), the Board found that a probationer was terminated for postappointment reasons when, after his appointment, he was denied a security clearance required for his position, although the basis for denying the clearance was a condition that existed prior to his appointment. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 52, &#x00B6; 8 (2010), the Board found that, even assuming that a probationer's postappointment failure to qualify for a Government credit card was attributable to his preappointment credit history, his termination for failure to secure approval for the card constituted a postappointment reason for termination because securing the card was a requirement of his position, which he failed to satisfy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, in the present case, the appellant was not terminated because, following his appointment, he was denied or failed to obtain a condition of employment based on a preexisting condition. Rather, he was terminated based on the terms of the probation agreement, a condition that existed prior to his appointment. Moreover, unlike <span class="Italic">Von Deneen</span> and <span class="Italic">Rivera</span>, it is not clear that the appellant's probation agreement prevented him from performing his job duties or that he failed to satisfy a requirement of his position as a result of his probation agreement. Although the agency's termination notice cites to the conditions of the appellant's June 22, 2007 probation agreement prohibiting his computer use without prior court approval, the record reflects that such conditions were subsequently modified by the court on August 29, 2012, over 2 years prior to the appellant's appointment, to permit him to use and access computers under the terms of the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Office Computer and Internet Monitoring Program. Additionally, the appellant submitted emails from his probation officer in which she indicates that she allowed the appellant to accept the job after speaking with a human resources specialist regarding the details of the job duties, obtaining a copy of the job description, and verifying that the agency was aware of the appellant's conviction and that he was under a term of supervision. In an email, the appellant's probation officer also states that she would never have allowed him to accept the position if she thought that it would have been in violation of the terms of his probation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the decision in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Justice</span>, 524 Fed. Appx. 660 (Fed. Cir. 2013), to be instructive. In <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the agency terminated the employment of a probationary Cook Supervisor after receiving the results of an internal investigation into his misconduct in a prior position as a Correctional Officer. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 524 Fed. Appx. at 661-62. Although the probationer's preappointment misconduct was not substantiated until the postappointment receipt of the report, the court found that the Board correctly concluded that he was terminated for preappointment reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 663-64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, here, the agency contends that it did not become aware of the specific terms of the appellant's probation agreement until 2 months after he was appointed, and it subsequently terminated him for reasons including "the conditions of [his] probation" concerning computer access and monitoring. We find that the agency based the appellant's termination, at least in part, on the conditions of his probation and that these conditions arose before his appointment. The agency concedes that the appellant identified his conviction and probation status on his declaration for Federal employment, dated October 24, 2014, but does not explain why it hired him without inquiring about the specific terms of his probation status. Nor does the agency dispute the appellant's assertions that his probation officer contacted a human resources specialist to confirm that the agency was aware of the appellant's prior bank fraud conviction and that the appellant was currently on Federal supervision and needed to comply with all of the conditions of his supervision. Even if the agency did not become aware of the specific conditions of the appellant's probation agreement until after he was appointed, the timing of the agency's discovery of the specific terms of his preappointment probation agreement does not render the appellant's termination to be based on conditions arising postappointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not to say that, after becoming aware of the terms of the appellant's probation agreement, the agency could not have terminated his employment during his probationary period. The agency was nonetheless required to afford the appellant the procedural protections set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. It is undisputed that the agency did not provide the appellant with these procedural rights, which include advance notice of the termination, an opportunity to respond, and consideration of the response. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. Therefore, the relevant inquiry is whether the agency's failure to follow these procedures was harmful error. <span class="Italic">Hope</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that harmful error cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only when the record shows that it was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(r). The burden is on the appellant to show that the procedural error was harmful. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(r). Because the administrative judge found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal, the record is not developed on the issue of whether the appellant met his burden of establishing that the agency would not have terminated him had it provided him with advance notice of the termination, an opportunity to respond, and consideration of his response. On remand, the administrative judge shall render a new decision after affording the parties the opportunity to present evidence and argument on this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DE-315H-11-0384-I-1 (NP 7/12/2012) ("Although the appellant refers to events that may have predated her appointment, the Board has held that it is necessary to distinguish between a pre-existing condition and the effect that condition has on an employee's performance or conduct during her probationary period. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 52, &#x00B6; 8 (2010); <span class="Italic">Rhone v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 257, 259 (1995). Even if the appellant's post-appointment performance could be attributed in part to these events, her termination for unacceptable performance would nonetheless constitute a post-appointment reason because the agency in essence charged her with failing to meet the requirements of her position during her probationary period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rhone</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 258-60; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Awa v.
