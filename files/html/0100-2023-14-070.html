<p class="Body-Text">"An appellant's performance on the job and ability to get along with co-workers are appropriate factors to consider in evaluating the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty." <span class="Italic">Luciano v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 335, 342-43 &#x00B6; 21 (2001). An agency may explain that an action is in part justified by an employee's past poor performance, but the employee's appraisal demonstrates good or excellent performance<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Turner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 13 MSPR 499, 501 (1982) (supervisor gave an appellant a satisfactory rating, despite performance deficiencies, because he lacked time to counsel or to give him another type of rating; another supervisor gave the employee a satisfactory rating because he hoped the appellant's performance would improve). The issue then is how much weight the Board should place on supervisory comments provided during the course of Board litigation that are contrary to official appraisals issued before the litigation developed. If the issue is misconduct, e.g., absence, the appraisal may have little weight, <span class="Italic">Lemons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 12 MSPR 239, 243-44 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exhibit G is appellant's most recent satisfactory performance rating. Appellant contends this is proof of the arbitrary and capricious action of the agency in removing him. We find, however, that while appellant's over-all performance of his duties throughout the rating period was satisfactory, he was still subject to dismissal in the interests of promoting the efficiency of the service. The holder of a satisfactory rating is not immune to removal for cause<span class="Italic">. Atkinson v. U.S.,</span> 144 Ct. Cl. 585, 596 (1959). Therefore, the Board finds no inconsistency in the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Valles v. Dept. of State,</span> 17 F.4th 149, 151-53 (Fed. Cir. 2021), implicitly declined to give controlling weight to a satisfactory performance rating that arguably encompassed deficiencies that in part led to an adverse action removal of the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Valles argues that the Board erred in disregarding the "Fully Successful" evaluation because the evaluation rebuts Charge One.[2] On Charge One, the Board rejected Mr. Valles' argument that the evaluation undermined the agency's proof, found no inconsistency between the evaluation and the charge, and instead credited "management's conclusion that [Mr. Valles'] misbehavior presented an issue of misconduct more than performance" and "management's distinction that performance involves an employee who 'can't do,' while misconduct involves an employee who 'won't do.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In support of his argument, Mr. Valles cites to <span class="Italic">Moretz v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 376, 378 (1984), for the proposition that "a successful performance rating rebuts a charge of failing to meet the standards of a position." Appellant's Opening Br. 37. However, in <span class="Italic">Moretz,</span> the agency relied on the evaluation to establish below standard performance. 19 M.S.P.R. at 378. The Board merely determined that a work evaluation could not sustain a charge of failing to meet the standards of the position because the specifications were based on "scores connoting less than fully satisfactory, but not entirely unsatisfactory, work performance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the deciding official did not rely on the evaluation to establish unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Mr. Valles that the Board should have considered the evaluation. Issues of misconduct and performance may overlap. In this case, the agency's employee appraisal form itself demonstrates that following instructions can fall within this area of overlap: one performance requirement is that an employee "[f]ollows passport services procedures and directives related to the adjudication of a passport application." At oral argument, the government admitted that the evaluation covers following instructions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Oral Arg. at 14:20-15:06, <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20-1686_08312021.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20-1686_08312021.mp3.</a> Under these circumstances, the evaluation was clearly relevant, and the Board was obligated to consider it. In so holding, we do not suggest that the existence of a fully successful performance evaluation bars discipline for matters covered by the evaluation, but merely that the evaluation must be considered in making the determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we also conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the Board's disregard of the evaluation was not reversible error. As an appellate court, we are obligated to apply the rule of harmless error, examining the record "without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2111. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shinseki v. Sanders,</span> 556 U.S. 396, 411 (2009); <span class="Italic">Boss v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> 908 F.3d 1278, 1282-83 (Fed. Cir. 2018); <span class="Italic">Giove v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 230 F.3d 1333, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Although the test for harmful error can be complex, we think that, in the circumstances of this case, Mr. Valles must show a "likelihood that the result would have been different." <span class="Italic">Sanders,</span> 556 U.S. at 411.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Valles bears the burden of establishing harmful error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 409-10 (party appealing an administrative decision bears the burden of establishing harmful error); <span class="Italic">see also Palmer v. Hoffman,</span> 318 U.S. 109, 116 (1943) ("He who seeks to have a judgment set aside because of an erroneous ruling carries the burden of showing that prejudice resulted.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Valles has not shown that the consideration of the evaluation would likely lead to a different result on Charge One. He did not dispute at the agency or the Board that any of the events underlying the specifications occurred. Mr. Valles held onto completed applications for three days before passing them along to his supervisor despite being told to move them along "as soon as possible" to limit delays (Specifications 1-4), provided an inaccurate or untimely text update on an application (Specification 5), misplaced applications (Specification 6), held off on working on an application for a day despite being told to do so promptly (Specification 7), and passed along incomplete batches of applications to his supervisor that were not ready for review (Specifications 8-11). Furthermore, five of the eleven specifications in Charge One took place in 2019, after the evaluation period, and thus could not be rebutted by the evaluation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, Mr. Valles has not shown harmful error with respect to the proof of Charge One.</p>

USDA,</span> SF-0752-15-0309-I-1 (NP 4/27/2016) ("The appellant also argus that his final performance evaluation for the period encompassing March through September 2013 belies the agency's supposed concerns about his ability to perform. However, even if the agency's concerns about the appellant's ability to perform in the future have not borne out, we find that this does not undermine the legitimacy of those concerns."); <span class="Italic">Fontes v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 51 MSPR 655, 668 (1991) ("We do not find the favorable performance rating given the appellant by Jaillet, or the merit pay increase resulting from that rating, to indicate that Jaillet thought removal was inappropriate. The appellant was not removed for unsatisfactory performance of his job duties; he was removed for misconduct."); <span class="Italic">Price v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 107, 110 (1982) ("The fact that appellant was performing his duties at an acceptable level of competence for purposes of receiving a within-grade salary increase under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.404 is irrelevant to his removal for misconduct under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.301 [(1982)]."); <span class="Italic">Chin v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency contends that the appellant's performance is poor, and appraisals reflect the contrary, the Board may favor reliance on official appraisals, <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 70 MSPR 119, 122-23 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant argues, and we agree, that the agency's characterization of the appellant's past work record in the deciding official's March 29, 1995 memorandum analyzing the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, is inconsistent with the written appraisals of her performance. In the memorandum discussing the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the deciding official stated that the appellant, over the last 2 years, "has displayed a steady trend towards increasing irresponsibility and undependability...." In support of this assertion, the memorandum stated that the appellant has failed to complete her duties by the end of her shift, had developed personality conflicts with all members of the staff, and was argumentative if asked to assist in any work. The memorandum also pointed to the appellant's improper use of the telephone for personal business and her suspension for unauthorized personal long distance calls on a government telephone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the narrative of the initial performance appraisal, covering the period of April 19, 1993, through July 17, 1993, stated that the appellant "[c]onsistently displays a courteous and professional manner when interacting with patients, families and co-workers. Has been mentioned on several patient questionnaires as having been a positive influence on their hospital stay." This appraisal further stated, "[w]ith a cheerful attitude, consistently promotes team work. Completes own shift duties error free, and routinely assists others. As shift leader, ensures all tasks are completed in a timely manner." The appellant's overall performance rating for this initial appraisal period was "fully successful" and she was rated as exceeding the performance standard in six categories of her critical elements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's annual performance rating for the following year (July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994) was similar. Again, the appellant's overall performance rating was "fully successful" and there were no negative comments in the appraisal's narrative. Rather, the narrative stated that <span id="Page_2364"></span>the appellant "effectively prioritizes, ensuring highest quality patient care." It also stated that the appellant was "[a] daptable and composed under stressful and changing situations" and that her "foresight and adaptability have prevented numerous potential problems or delays in surgery."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, on the periodic performance evaluation completed after her last formal performance appraisal, the appellant's "strengths" were listed as her "positive attitude," "problem solving abilities," and "willingness to work." Only one item was listed under "areas to improve": <span class="Italic">"Must</span> stop the personnel [sic] phone calls at work!" Under the category of "dependability," the evaluation stated that the appellant "[c]ompletes assigned tasks. Help[s] others to do their job. Ha[s] shown great improvement in getting to work on time. Willingly stays late to make sure job gets done." Under the category of "work management," the evaluation stated, "[t]akes several pts [sic] &#x0026; completes all duties. Must limit socializing at work (phone calls &#x0026; talking to friends in hall way). Consistently completes additional duties." Last, under the category of "communications," the evaluation stated, "[t]horough nurses notes. Works very well [with] others--cheerful attitude fosters morale. Positive rapport [with] other services."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, the appellant's two most recent performance appraisals and the periodic performance evaluation, contrary to the agency's assertions in the deciding official's discussion of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, do not show a trend towards increasing irresponsibility and undependability. In direct contradiction to the agency's discussion of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the appellant's performance appraisals and her periodic performance evaluation indicate that her problem with tardiness had improved, that she completed her assignments and willingly stayed late to make sure her duties were completed, that she had a cheerful, positive attitude, worked well with others, and had a strong willingness to work. In fact, the only consistency between the agency's discussion of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and its evaluations is its criticism of the appellant's use of the telephone for personal calls and her socializing with friends during work time. None of the evaluations, however, indicates that this weakness overshadows the more numerous strengths demonstrated by the appellant's performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposing official testified that she and the deciding official referred to the March 29, 1995 memorandum setting forth the consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in determining the removal penalty. Because this memorandum is not supported by the agency's performance appraisals and the periodic performance evaluation of the appellant, we find that the March 29, 1995 memorandum is entitled to very little weight in determining the reasonableness of the agency's penalty determination.</p>
