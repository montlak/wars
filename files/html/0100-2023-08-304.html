<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-297"><span class="space">a.</span> National Guard USERRA Discrimination and Restoration Claims</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">National Guard technicians' employment rights claims are no longer subject to Board appeal, as a result of a statutory amendment, <span class="Italic">Asatov v. MSPB</span>, 595 Fed. Appx. 979, 980-83 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP) (exclusion of National Guard technicians from the protections of both USERRA and VEOA):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rakhmatulla Asatov appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB" or "Board") dismissing the appeal of his non-selection for two employment positions with the Connecticut Army National Guard for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. The MSPB stated that it cannot order that remedial action be taken by the state authority that controls the employment of National Guard technicians, and thus "even if [Mr. Asatov] establishes the Board's jurisdiction over his VEOA [Veterans Employment Opportunity Act] and USERRA [Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act] claims, it does not appear that the Board can provide him with effective relief in the event he prevails."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Asatov argues that since National Guard technicians are federal employees, the VEOA and USERRA apply, and that his rights under these statutes were violated when the Connecticut Army National Guard failed to hire him for certain National Guard technician positions. The Department of Labor notified Mr. Asatov of the right to appeal his VEOA claim to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB dismissed his appeals for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. It stated that even if the subject matter is within the Board's jurisdiction, MSPB orders are not enforceable against State adjutants general. This court has accepted and endorsed that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Melendez v. Puerto Rico National Guard</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 252 (1996), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span> 152 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the Board held that "because the Puerto Rico National Guard is not a federal entity and because the adjutant general is not a federal employee, the Board has no authority to enforce its decision in this case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 253-54. The Board again held in <span class="Italic">McVay v. Arkansas National Guard</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 120 (1998), that even if the appellant could prevail on the merits of his claim against a state National Guard, he would be without a remedy, and that an MSPB decision on the merits would be a prohibited advisory opinion. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 124-25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit agreed with this position, holding in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. MSPB</span>, 244 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2001), that "[MSPB] orders are not enforceable against national guards." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1337. In <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, a National Guard technician sought remedy in the MSPB against the Ohio National Guard for violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act. On appeal the Federal Circuit received the argument that "[t]he Adjutant General of the State of Ohio is an agency of the Federal Government as 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 charges him with employment and administration of civilian technicians who are federal employees." Brief of Petitioner at 12, <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 244 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We held that the adjutant general is an employee of the State, and that since the National Guard can act only through its adjutant general in employment matters, and "no order of the Board may be directed to the Adjutant General," the Board has no enforceable remedy. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1336. We affirmed the MSPB's dismissal on the ground that the appellant had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Asatov states that the precedent on which the overruled. He points to <span class="Italic">Sanford v. Connecticut National Guard</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 120 (1991), where the MSPB held that "national guard technicians are employees of an agency in the executive branch who may appeal a restoration claim to the Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 123. Mr. Asatov argues that <span class="Italic">Sanford</span> was never overruled, and that the several conflicting opinions should be resolved in favor of traditional appeal rights. However, in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, the MSPB explained that <span class="Italic">Sanford</span> is "no longer effective" for restoration actions because a judicial remedy is available:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB and the Federal Circuit have relied on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), which limits the MSPB's enforcement authority to a "Federal agency or employee," to hold that the MSPB lacks enforcement power in cases involving National Guard technician employment matters, even if subject matter jurisdiction exists. Applying this precedent, we conclude that Mr. Asatov's appeal to the MSPB was correctly dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The National Guard Technicians Act, section 709(d) provides that the state adjutant general will "employ and administer the technicians," including the "dual status" positions for which Mr. Asatov applied. The Act provides</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the National Guard Technicians Act provides background for the <span class="Italic">Singleton</span> decision. The Senate Report on the National Guard Technicians Act states that a "principal feature" of the Act is the "[r]equirement for adjutants general to be the sole agent for employment and administration of [the] technician program under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned." S. Rep. No. 90-1446 (2d Sess. 1968). The Report explains that the designation of the state adjutant general "to employ and administer the technicians" is</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">intended to achieve two purposes: (a) <span class="Italic">recognize the State character of the Guard</span> and (b) meet the requirement of giving the <span class="Italic">adjutants general (who are State officers)</span> the statutory function of employing Federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 15 (emphases added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 114 Cong. Rec. 23,251 (July 25, 1968) (remarks of Sen.

(emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA, one of the statutes invoked by Mr. Asatov, provides for a judicial appeal path in district or state court. In defining the term "employer," USERRA provides: "In the case of a National Guard technician employed under section 709 of Title 32, the term 'employer' technician is employed." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(4)(B). The procedure for "[e]nforcement of [USERRA] rights with respect to a State or private employer" is set out in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323, which provides for district court jurisdiction over actions against a state commenced by the United States, and state court jurisdiction over actions against a state commenced by a person. The National Guard federal regulations explain that "[a]n action brought against a State Adjutant General, as an employer of a civilian National Guard technician, is considered an action against a State for purposes of determining which court has jurisdiction." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative purpose of the National Guard Technicians Act has been reviewed in various contexts. In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees AFL-CIO, Local 2953 v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 730 F.2d 1534 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the District of Columbia Circuit discussed the status of National Guard technicians for the purpose of determining whether a state adjutant general is required to engage in certain collective bargaining negotiations. The court reviewed the legislative structure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It thus appears that the scheme of the National Guard Technicians Act is to create the technicians as nominal federal employees for a very limited purpose and to recognize the military authority of the states through their Governors and Adjutants General to employ, command and discharge them. The employment, discipline and discharge of technicians remains completely with the state officials, and their day to day activities on the job are controlled at the state level. In addition, no appeal lies from personnel decisions of the adjutants general.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1537-38. means the adjutant general of the State in which the Also in the context of collective bargaining rights, the Federal Labor Relations Authority held that "[u]nder the Technician Act, general authority over employment is vested in state officials--at least to some degree--as is unreviewable authority over discipline, separations, and reductions in force." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The consistent position of these federal agencies, and the accumulated weight of precedent in a variety of situations, reinforce the conclusion that appeal to the MSPB was excluded in the statutory plan for National Guard technician employment matters. The MSPB's dismissal of Mr. Asatov's appeal is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's jurisdictional vacillations are traced below.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Britton v. USDA</span>, 23 MSPR 170, 171-73 (1984), outlined restoration rights for federal employees returning from National Guard service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Edna M. Britton (appellant) filed an appeal with the Board's Seattle Regional Office pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401 because of the failure of the Department of Agriculture, United States Forest Service (agency), to restore her to her former position as a Supervisory Personnel Assistant, GS-7, in the Olympia National Forest following her completion of a two year Active Guard Reserve tour of duty. In the initial decision, the presiding official found that by restoring her to an equivalent position in Seattle, Washington, instead of a position of like seniority, status, and pay, in the Olympia, Washington commuting area, the agency failed to properly restore appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filed a timely petition for review alleging that the presiding official erred by ordering appellant reinstated to a position in her former commuting area because there were no positions of like seniority, status, and pay at that facility available as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that in June 1981, appellant was ordered to active duty for two years by the Washington National Guard. She was granted leave without pay by the agency during the two year period. As a result of a reorganization in September 1981, appellant's position was abolished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the close of her two year tour of active duty, appellant requested restoration to her former position. Appellant was notified by the agency that her position had been abolished and the agency offered her restoration to an equivalent position located in the Seattle, Washington commuting area. Appellant twice declined this offer indicating each time that she would only consider her former position in Olympia. However, her letters also informed the agency that she would only consider a position in the Olympia, Washington commuting area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to appeal to the Board from an agency's failure to restore after active duty in the National Guard arises under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a)(2). That section provides that an employee who leaves a position in her agency with the right to return to her position under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024(d) may appeal to the Board in furtherance of her right to return to work in accordance with the provisions of that section and those contained in 5 C.F.R. Part 353. The presiding official therefore erred in interpreting appellant's appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5331 since that section does not create any appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 234, 4 M.S.P.R. 149 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a federal employee returning from a tour of active duty in the National Guard, appellant's restoration rights are set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024(d). That section provides that an employee is to be returned to her position with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation as she would have had, had she not been absent. In addition, OPM regulations provide that where an employee's position is abolished during her absence, the agency shall reassign the employee to another position of like seniority, status, and pay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.201(c). Therefore, the Board must determine whether the agency has in fact shown that by offering appellant an equivalent position in Seattle, it provided her with a position of like seniority, status, and pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM regulations do not state whether an offer of equivalent position in another installation meets the restoration requirements of "like seniority, status, and pay." However, guidance is provided at 353 FPM App. B-3 (October 29, 1975). This section, which is not inconsistent with the regulations, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although employees' restoration rights are agency-wide, the basic right is for restoration at the installation they left because of injury or military duty. Employees and their agency may agree, however, that they be restored at another installation. <span class="Italic">Also, if employees cannot be restored to their former positions and if there are no acceptable positions at the installation they left,</span> they may elect to take a position of like seniority, status and pay at another installation instead of the next best available position at the installation they left. (See section 4-2 of chapter 353.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board construes this language as requiring that, unless the parties agree otherwise, the agency must restore the qualifying employee at the facility which last employed her in her former position or, if that position is not available, to a position of like seniority, status, and pay, or if such equivalent position is not available, then to the next best available position for which she is qualified. Only if it is determined that there are no positions available for which the employee qualifies at the same facility, may the agency offer an equivalent position at another facility. <span class="Italic">Cf. Whitfield v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 5 MSPB 283 (1981). Further, consistent with its burden of proof in appeals before the Board, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1), the agency must submit evidence regarding all such equivalent or next best available positions and any restrictive qualification requirements to show that it could not restore the employee to a position at the same facility before reassigning the employee to a position at another facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, even though appellant notified the agency that she would only accept restoration to her former position, which had been abolished, she also informed the agency that she would only accept a position in the Olympia commuting area. The agency admitted that it made no effort to place appellant in the next best available position for which she would qualify in its Olympia commuting area before ordering her reassigned to Seattle. Therefore the Board finds that the agency has failed to meet its burden of proof regarding appellant's restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Britton,</span> the Board elaborated on military restoration rights for a<span id="Page_511"></span> National Guard technician, <span class="Italic">Hetsler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 150, 152-54 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee returning from military duty is entitled to be restored as soon as possible after his application for restoration is received by the agency, but in no event, later than 30 days after his application is received. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.302. The regulations further provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee is entitled to be restored to employment in the following order, unless the position is occupied by an employee in a higher retention subgroup under Part 351 of this chapter:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;To the position to which promoted while he was injured or on military duty, or, if that position is not available, to a position of like seniority, status, and pay;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;To the position he left because of injury or military duty, or, if that position is not available, to a position of like seniority, status, and pay;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;To the next best available position for which he is qualified. For purposes of this paragraph, the next best available position is one that most nearly approximates in seniority, status, and pay the position to which an employee is entitled under either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Britton v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 23 MSPR 170 1984), the Board found that although a qualifying employee's restoration rights to a position of like seniority, status, and pay must first be considered at the employee's former facility, the parties could mutually agree to placement at another agency facility. In this case, there were no equivalent positions available at appellant's former work station in Mansfield. On September 9, 1983, the agency informed appellant of the equivalent position in Toledo, Ohio. The agency official, Kent Mattison, testified that he did not send appellant further information concerning the position because appellant did not supply him with a current address. However, the Board notes that appellant's permanent address has remained the same from the time he enlisted in the Air Force in 1979 through the date he filed his appeal with the Board. In addition, appellant's discharge papers from the military branch of the Air Force, dated two days after appellant's conversation with Mattison, contain this same address.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board holds that with minimum effort, the agency could have located appellant's address and sent him the information concerning the Toledo position. Had appellant then not responded in a timely manner, it would be possible to find that he constructively rejected the offer and that the agency had met its obligation to restore appellant to duty under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.302. Based on the agency's lack of effort, however, the Board cannot agree with the findings of the presiding official that appellant constructively rejected the offer and therefore was properly restored to the GS-4 position. Appellant made overtures to the agency more than three months prior to his honorable discharge indicating his wish to be restored, and then kept in contact with the agency officials. After being offered the position in Toledo, he went to the city to inspect the community. He has acted with diligence at all times in attempting to be restored to an equivalent position following his honorable discharge from the Air Force.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ward v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 635, 636-41 (1994), analyzed service time and related Board jurisdiction over a restoration rights appeal for a National Guard member:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was serving in the position of Supervisor, Respiratory Therapy, when he was ordered to full-time duty in the Massachusetts Active Guard/Reserve. The appellant was ordered to serve a three-year tour of duty, beginning on September 29, 1986. On August 17, 1989, the appellant's tour was extended from September 29, 1989, until April 1, 1993. The appellant was released from duty prior to the expiration of his extended tour when he was honorably discharged from duty on April 14, 1991, after failing to complete the physical requirements necessary to remain on active duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 10, 1993, the appellant filed a petition for appeal, alleging that the agency improperly abridged his restorations rights and failed to provide him with notice of his appeal rights regarding this matter. The administrative judge informed the appellant that a question existed regarding the timeliness of the appeal, and directed the appellant to submit evidence and argument regarding timeliness. Upon consideration of the appellant's submission, the administrative judge scheduled a hearing, after which he issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In doing so, the administrative judge found as follows: (1) 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024[1] governs the restoration rights of Federal employees who leave their positions to enter on active duty in military service; (2) the appellant did not satisfy the conditions set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(a) because that section applies to employees who enlist in the Armed Forces of the United States (other than in a Reserve component), and the appellant neither enlisted in the Armed Forces nor was in other than a Reserve component; (3) the appellant did not meet the restoration requirements under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(b)(1), which is limited to individuals whose active duty does not exceed four years, plus any additional period for which the person was unable to obtain orders relieving such person from active duty, because, assuming the appellant's National Guard duty fell under this provision, his service lasted longer than four years and his service beyond four years was voluntary, and not due to his inability to obtain orders releasing him from active duty; (4) assuming the appellant's National Guard duty applied to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(b)(2), his service did not satisfy that statutory section because the Board has held that it is limited to duty lasting no longer than four years and 180 days, and the appellant's duty exceeded this length of time; and (5) the appellant's duty did not satisfy 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(c), which provides restoration rights to any member of a Reserve component who is ordered to an initial period of active duty for training of not less than twelve consecutive weeks after release from such active duty for training after satisfactory service, because the appellant's rights were limited to three years, his initial period of active duty for training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;This statutory provision is now found at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304. We will refer to section 4304 henceforth in this Opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erroneously interpreted the statutory requirements regarding his restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board has jurisdiction over the appellantTs claim that he is entitled to the restoration rights provided in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(c).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4304(c), 38 U.S.C., provides in pertinent parts as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States who is ordered to an initial period of active duty for training of not less than twelve consecutive weeks shall, upon application for reemployment within thirty-one days after...such member's release from such active duty for training after satisfactory service...be entitled to all reemployment rights and benefits provided by this chapter for persons inducted under the provisions of the Military Selective Service Act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant provisions of the Military Selective Service Act are found at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a). It states as follows:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4304(c) must be read in conjunction with section 4301(a) with respect to matters about which section 4304(c) is otherwise silent. <span class="Italic">See Zeczycki v. Trinity Memorial Hospital,</span> 113 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2163, 2165, 2167, 1983 WL 1991 (E.D. Wis.1983); <span class="Italic">Green v. Oktibbeha County Hospital,</span> 526 F. Supp. 49, 52, 54 (N.D. Miss.1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant is not a member of a "Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States," his service in the Massachusetts National Guard satisfies this aspect of the statutory requirement in section 4304(c) for entitlement to restoration. Section 3551, 5 U.S.C., states that a Federal employee who is ordered to active duty or to duty under sections 502-505 of title 32, U.S.C., as a Reserve of the armed forces or member of the National Guard is entitled, on release from duty within the time limits specified in the Military Selective Service Act, to be restored to the position held when ordered to duty. The Board has recognized that this statutory provision was intended to give Reservists and National Guardsmen who were Federal employees the same restoration rights that applied to other persons.[2] <span class="Italic">See Sheldon v. Department of the Navy,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 88, 91-92 (1990). As the administrative judge found, the record here establishes that the appellant<span id="Page_512"></span> was ordered to active duty in the National Guard under the authority of 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 502(f). Section 4304(c) therefore applies to his National Guard service. <span class="Italic">See also Monroe v. Standard Oil Co.,</span> 452 U.S. 549, 554-56, 101 S. Ct. 2510, 2514, 69 L. Ed.2d 226 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Section 3551, 5 U.S.C., however, does not create a right to appeal an alleged restoration denial to the Board. That right arises under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301 and 353.401, which provide that an employee or former employee seeking to return to the civil service may appeal to the Board if that person has a restoration right under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021, 4304(a), (b), or (c). <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 234, 4 M.S.P.R. 149, 149-50 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next matter of inquiry is whether the appellant has been ordered to an initial period of active duty for training of not less than twelve weeks. An initial period of active duty for training is usually a specific type of order to duty issued to an individual with no prior military experience upon joining the Reservist or National Guard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Zeczycki,</span> 113 L.R.R.M. at 2164; <span class="Italic">Green,</span> 526 F. Supp. at 52, 54. <span class="Italic">See also</span> Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Chapter 353, Subchapter 1-4(c)(5). The appellant's service history and National Guard order to duty in the present case differ from the typical situation. Although the appellant was a member of the Massachusetts National Guard since 1966, he did not serve any period of active duty until he was ordered to "Full-Time duty" for a period of three years, beginning on September 29, 1986, for his "Initial AGR Tour." The appellant testified that this activation was for active duty, and that active duty for training was an entirely different type of service. The appellant also explained that "AGR" was an acronym for the phrase Active Guard in Reserve.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's testimony regarding the nature of his order to duty does not resolve this matter because determining whether the appellant's service constitutes active duty for training is a legal issue, rather than a factual one. We further find that the appellant's service, in fact, constitutes active duty for training within the meaning of section 4304(c). Section 4304(f), 5 U.S.C., provides that, for purposes of subsection (c), "full-time training or other full-time duty performed by a member of the National Guard under section...502...of title 32 is considered active duty for training." Here, the appellant was ordered to full-time duty for three years, and such active duty was later extended for an additional period of approximately one and one half years. Under section 4304(f), the appellant's full-time duty constitutes active duty for training for purposes of section 4304(c). <span class="Italic">See Peel v. Florida Department of Transportation,</span> 443 F. Supp. 451, 454 (N.D. Fla.1977), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 600 F.2d 1070 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also met the statutory requirement of being ordered to an "initial period" of active duty for training of not less than twelve consecutive weeks. As discussed above, the appellant did not serve any active duty until he began serving his September 29, 1986 duty tour. Further, the appellant's orders indicate that the appellant was being called to his "Initial AGR Tour," for a period of three years. Because the appellant was ordered to an initial period of active duty, which constitutes active duty for training, lasting longer than twelve consecutive weeks, he also meets this statutory requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we disagree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's duty did not satisfy 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(c), because the appellant's rights were limited to three years, his initial period of active duty for training, rather than his entire period of actual service. The "initial period" provision in section 4304(c) pertains to the "order" to service, rather than the period of actual service. <span class="Italic">See Zeczycki,</span> 113 L.R.R.M. at 2166-67. As discussed above, the appellant was ordered to an "Initial AGR Tour." Further, the reemployment rights at issue arise upon "application for reemployment within thirty-one days after...such member's release from such active duty for training after satisfactory service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(c). The appellant here, however, was not released from "such active duty" at the expiration of his initial three-year appointment. Instead, he was again ordered to full-time duty for a period of three and one-half years, the purpose of which was the "continuation of AGR 5 Tour." Further, the appellant testified that this extension was at the request of the National Guard. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant's restoration rights under section 4304(c) were not limited to the appellant's first three years of duty; they arose upon his release from the continuation of his initial AGR tour. We further find that there is also no other prohibition on the length of service for purposes of restoration rights under section 4304(c). Unlike subsections 4304(a) and (b), subsection 4304(c) does not contain a limitation on the length of service for entitlement to restoration rights. The Supreme Court has held that it is improper to read a time limit into the restoration rights described in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d) because that section was silent about any time limit on the protection it provides. <span class="Italic">See King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,</span> 502 U.S. 215, 112 S. Ct. 570, 573-74, 116 L. Ed.2d 578 (1991). Because subsection 4304(c) is similarly silent regarding a time limit, it would be improper to impose one here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, finding that further adjudication is necessary to determine whether the appellant's restoration appeal is properly before the Board, we REMAND this appeal to the field office for determinations on the issues of the timeliness of the appellant's request for reemployment and the timeliness of his appeal to the Board. If, on remand, the administrative judge finds for the appellant on both of these timeliness issues, the administrative judge should also allow the agency to raise the limited exception to reemployment of changed circumstances making it impossible or unreasonable to reinstate the appellant. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a); <span class="Italic">see Green,</span> 526 F. Supp. at 54-56.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At first the Board determined that because it lacked enforcement authority against a state national guard, it had no jurisdiction to direct reemployment of a civilian technician with the state national guard. <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Massachusetts Nat'l Guard</span>, 42 MSPR 251 (1989) (extensive discussion of the nature of national guard employment; not addressing jurisdiction of federal district courts over restoration claims brought against state agencies under 38 USC 2022)). But it reversed that position, after it requested remands from the Federal Circuit companion cases in <span class="Italic">Sanford v. Connecticut Nat'l Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 120, 123-24 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a separate case also remanded to the Board by the Federal Circuit, we have overruled <span class="Italic">Gordon,</span> holding that a National Guard technician must be considered as a civilian employee of the Department of the Army or Air Force, and thus an "employee of an agency in the executive branch" who has the same right as other civilian employees of the Army and Air Force to appeal a failure to restore or improper restoration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a). <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona National Guard</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 182, 186-87 (1991). Accordingly, we reverse our prior decision dismissing the appellant's restoration claim for lack of jurisdiction. We therefore turn to the agency's contentions of error with respect to the merits of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge properly calculated the period of back pay to which the appellant is entitled</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Military membership in the National Guard was a condition of the appellant's employment as a civilian technician. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b). When such a technician is separated from the National Guard or ceases to hold the military grade specified for his position, the adjutant general of the jurisdiction involved must "promptly separate[ ] [the individual] from his technician employment." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e)(1). Before such separation can be effected, however, the individual must be given at least 30 days' written notice. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e)(6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant had lost his military membership in the National Guard, the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant was not entitled to an indefinite restoration to his technician position. He was, however, entitled to be restored for at least the 30-day statutory notice period. The agency concedes that it did not restore the appellant to his employment as required by law, and that some back pay is therefore due him. Citing <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730, 733 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1984), for the proposition that an injured party should be placed, as near as may be, in the position he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed, the agency argues that the back pay award should be limited to 30 days, and that the award of back pay for more than a year ordered by the administrative judge represents an unjustified windfall to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The back pay issue in this case is virtually identical to that faced by the Court of Claims in <span class="Italic">Polos v. United States,</span> 621 F.2d 385 (Ct. Cl. 1980). The plaintiff in that case also sought restoration to his technician position and back pay after he was discharged from his military position in the Air National Guard for physical disability. There, as here, the state National Guard unit delayed in providing the written notice of separation required by 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e)(6). Rejecting the agency's argument that the plaintiff's back pay should be limited to 30 days, the court held that the 30-day period after which Polos could be separated did not begin to run until the date of the formal, written notice of separation, even though Polos might have been on actual notice prior to that date. 621 F.2d at 389. The court therefore approved an award of back pay from the date Polos sought restoration, until 30 days following the written notice of separation, a period of 80 days. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 388-90.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties in this case were in agreement that the appellant's back pay should commence on July 23, 1988, the earliest date he was eligible for restoration. Following the precedent in <span class="Italic">Polos,</span> the administrative judge properly calculated that the appellant's back pay should continue through August 16, 1989, 30 days after the agency's written notice of separation of July 17, 1989. Although the period of back pay is considerably longer here than in <span class="Italic">Polos,</span> this is solely a result of the agency's delay of almost a year in providing the appellant with proper notice of separation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 182, 183-87 (1991), reversed the Board's earlier position in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> and concluded that state national guard civilian technicians have restoration rights the Board can enforce, subject to limitations on back pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_513"></span>The substantive rights of individuals returning from Federal military service to be restored to the jobs they held prior to entering into military service are contained in chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code, sections 2021-2026. Chapter 43 specifies the enforcement procedures to be used by a veteran who believes he was not properly restored to his former employment by a private employer or a state or local government employer. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2022. With respect to individuals who left Federal civilian employment to enter military service, the statute authorizes the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) "to issue regulations giving full force and effect to the provisions of this section insofar as they relate to persons entitled to be restored to or employed in positions in the executive branch of the Government...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2023(a). OPM has exercised this authority by promulgating Part 353 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations provide that "an employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch...may appeal to the [Merit Systems Protection Board] an agency's failure to restore or improper restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a) (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 granted National Guard technicians, previously considered state employees, Federal employee status: "A technician...is an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(d). Even though the Departments of the Army and Air Force are clearly Federal agencies within the meaning of the restoration statute and regulations,[4] the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> that technicians are Federal employees who hold positions in state organizations, and that they are therefore not entitled under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a) to file a restoration appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">Gordon, supra.</span> In reaching this conclusion, the Board first considered the unique status of state National Guards and National Guard technicians in our Federal structure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The National Guard...is "an essential reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States, available with regular forces in time of war," and "also may be federalized in addition to its role under state governments, to assist in controlling civil disorders." As the successor to the state militias of the nation's early years, the Guard fills a role recognized and provided for in the United States Constitution. This role does not fit neatly with the scope of either state or national concerns; historically the Guard has been, and today remains, something of a hybrid. Within each state the National Guard is a state agency, under state authority and control. At the same time, the activity, makeup, and function of the Guard are provided for, to a large extent, by federal law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mirroring this special posture of the Guard is the peculiar status of its employees. In addition to purely military personnel, the Guard employs civilians to perform a wide range of administrative, clerical, and technical tasks. Often the responsibilities and duties of these employees, who are generally referred to as National Guard technicians, correspond directly to those of other civilian employees, yet they arise in a distinctly military context, implicating significant military concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gordon,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 253-54 (quoting <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 348, 350 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The statute defines the term "agency in the executive branch of the Government" as "any department, independent establishment, agency, or corporation in the executive branch of the United States Government (including the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission)." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2023(a). The definition of "agency" contained in OPM's regulations is virtually identical. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board next considered the limited purposes for which Congress deemed technicians to be Federal employees and the restrictions on Federal control contained in the 1968 Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">According to the legislative history, the purpose of granting technicians Federal employee status was twofold: To provide a uniform and adequate retirement and fringe benefit program, and to bring technicians within the coverage of the Federal Tort Claims Act regarding third party actions against the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">While the Act made the technicians Federal employees, the adjutants general of the various states retain the authority to employ and administer the technicians. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(c). In addition, technicians may not appeal certain personnel actions beyond the state adjutant general, and the adverse action protections of chapter 75 of Title 5 do not apply to technicians. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e), (f). These provisions were intended to "recognize the State character of the Guard" and to "meet the requirement of giving the adjutants general (who are State officers) the statutory function of employing Federal employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gordon</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 255<span class="Italic"></span> (some citations deleted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that, notwithstanding the fact that technicians are Federal employees by virtue of 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709, they hold positions in the state National Guards, which are state organizations not included within the definition of agency contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102, and that they therefore have no right of appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a). 42 M.S.P.R. at 255.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the instant case was appealed to the Federal Circuit, the intervenor brought to the attention of the court an uncodified provision of the National Guard Technicians Act that was not considered in <span class="Italic">Gordon:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Except as provided in this Act and in the amendments made by this Act,</span> and notwithstanding any law, rule, regulation, or decision to the contrary, the positions of persons employed under section 709 of title 32, United States Code, existing on the day before the effective date of this Act, and the persons holding those positions on that day, shall, on and after that effective date, be considered to be positions in and employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and employees of the United States <span class="Italic">to the same extent as other positions in and employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub.&#x2003;L. No. 90-486, &#x00A7; 3(b), 82 Stat. 755, 757 (1968) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the primary concerns prompting the enactment of the 1968 Act were the lack of a uniform and adequate retirement and fringe benefit program, and the question of the technicians' legal status under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the language employed in section 3(b) establishes conclusively that technicians are not to be considered as Federal employees for these purposes only. Despite the fact that they work for state organizations under the authority of a state official, technicians must be considered as civilian employees of the Departments of the Army or Air Force who possess all the rights held by other Army and Air Force employees, save those rights specifically denied them in the National Guard Technicians Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act specifies only four situations in which technicians have lesser rights than other Army and Air Force employees: (1) separation from civilian employment in instances involving loss of a required military Guard membership or a military grade specified for the position; (2) separation from civilian employment as a result of failure to meet military security standards; (3) separation for cause by the adjutant general; and (4) reduction in force or adverse action involving discharge, suspension, furlough without pay, or reduction in rank or compensation. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e). In each of these instances, a technician's right of appeal does not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction involved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Restoration claims under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-2026 do not fall within any of the above exceptions. Accordingly, we conclude that a technician must be considered as a civilian employee of the Department of the Army or Air Force, and thus an "employee of an agency in the executive branch" who has the same right as other civilian employees of the Army and Air Force to appeal a failure to restore or improper restoration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a). The Board's contrary holding in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> is hereby overruled.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board reinforced its holding in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> by reference to its enforcement authority, which is limited to orders directed to Federal agencies and employees. Noting that a state National Guard is a state organization, and that the adjutant general--the only person authorized by law to employ a technician--is a state official, the Board found it incongruous for the Board to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's entitlement to restoration, but no authority to ensure compliance with that adjudication. 42 M.S.P.R. at 255. This concern remains troubling, but we find it an inadequate basis for deciding the jurisdictional issue, which is the only issue before the Board at this time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Melendez v. Puerto Rico Nat'l Guard</span>, 70 MSPR 252, 253-54 (1996), noted the enforcement limitations expressed in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, adding in footnote 2 the possibility of redress in a federal district court under 38 USC 4302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), the Board is authorized to enforce its orders against "any Federal agency or employee." Although the appellant is a federal employee, he works as a National Guard technician for a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico entity under the authority of a commonwealth official, the Adjutant General of the Puerto Rico National Guard. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 314 and 709(c) and (d); <span class="Italic">see Ockerhausen v. State of New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 484, 488 (1992). Because the Puerto Rico National Guard is not a federal entity and because the adjutant general is not a federal employee, the Board has no authority to enforce its decision in this case. <span class="Italic">See Kostan v. Arizona National Guard,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 182, 187 n.5 (1981) (recognizing the difference between the Board authority to adjudicate restoration cases involving National Guard technicians and its authority to enforce such decisions.)[1] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The holding in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> that the Board has jurisdiction over restoration cases involving National Guard technicians is no <span id="Page_514"></span>longer applicable. Subsequent legislation has eliminated Board jurisdiction in these types of cases. 38 U.S.C.A. Chap. 43 (West. Supp. 1995). However, the revised law does not apply to the instant case because it does not apply to reemployment actions initiated prior to December 1994. 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 4301 n.(f) (West Supp. 1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By footnote reference in a retirement case, <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM</span>, 90 MSPR 480, 489 n.6 (2002) (on reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 529 (2003)), the Board determined that <span class="Italic">Sanford</span> and <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> were no longer effective because of a statutory amendment to USERRA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These decisions are no longer effective because USERRA confers jurisdiction on the United States district courts to consider restoration actions brought on behalf of individuals by the United States against State employers. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323(b)(1). With regard to an individual who is not represented by the United States, USERRA provides that the individual may bring an action against a State employer in a State court of competent jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323(b)(2).</p>
