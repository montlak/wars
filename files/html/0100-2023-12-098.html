<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-97"><span class="space">a.</span> Evidence of Interim Relief</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Most cases involving proof of interim relief developed before the 1999 changes in the Board's regulations allowing agencies to certify that interim relief was provided. Earlier regulations required agencies to provide proof of interim relief with their PFRs. The older cases still provide guidance on the type of proof of interim relief that may be useful if interim relief is disputed. If there is a dispute concerning interim relief, generally personnel documents, for example, forms SF-50 and SF-52, provide evidence of interim relief that the Board requires. But interim relief may be otherwise evidenced, <span class="Italic">May v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 422, 424 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the purposes of establishing compliance with an interim relief order under 5 CFR 1201.115(b), documentary evidence such as Standard Form 50 or 52, a letter from an agency official to the appellant directing him to return to work and informing him that he has been reinstated as of the date of the initial decision, or a similar letter to the appellant explaining that he will not be brought back to work but will be paid appropriately, would suffice.... In the absence of such documentary evidence, an affidavit or declaration specifying the manner of the agency's compliance with the interim relief order is required.... If the agency submits such evidence and it establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance, the Board will inquire no further in the absence of a timely challenge by the appellant to the sufficiency of the agency's evidence of compliance with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 284, 288-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 2010 MSPB 241 (2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 451 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)), noted the basic requirements for proof of interim relief, subject to the appellant's challenge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency's petition for review of an initial decision that granted the appellant interim relief must be accompanied by a certification that the agency has complied with the interim relief order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(1). To establish compliance with an interim relief order, all that an agency must accomplish by the petition for review filing deadline is to take appropriate administrative action, such as executing an SF-50 or SF-52, that will result in the issuance of a paycheck for the interim relief period<span class="Italic">. Salazar v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 633, 639 (1994). Here, the agency submitted a certification and an SF-50 indicating that the appellant was returned to pay status effective December 16, 2009, the day the initial decision was issued. If the agency submits evidence that, on its face, shows that it has met its interim relief obligations, the Board will look no further into the matter absent a timely challenge by the appellant to the sufficiency of the agency's interim relief measures<span class="Italic">. May v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 422, 424 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.115(b), .116(a). An appellant's motion to dismiss a petition for review for noncompliance with an interim relief order must be filed before the record on review closes unless it is based on new and material evidence that was not readily available before the record closed<span class="Italic">. Forma v. Department of Justice</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 97, 102, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 11 F.3d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.116(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record on review closed on February 16, 2010. The appellant's pleading in which he argued that the agency failed to provide appropriate interim relief was filed 9 days later on February 25, 2010. The appellant has not shown that his claim of noncompliance with the interim relief order is based on evidence that was not readily available before the record closed. The Board, therefore, will not consider the appellant's untimely challenges to the agency's interim relief actions. <span class="Italic">See Alston v. Social Security Administration</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 6 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 134 Fed. Appx. 440 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided guidance on the methodology to be applied by agencies extending interim relief, <span class="Italic">Reid v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 84, 88-90 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following documentary evidence is sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance with an administrative judge's interim relief order under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b): A Standard Form 50 or 52, or, in Postal Service cases, a PS Form 50 or 52; a letter from an agency official to the appellant directing him to return to work and informing him that he has been reinstated as of the date of the initial decision; or a letter to the appellant and the administrative judge explaining that the agency has determined that the appellant's return or presence would be unduly disruptive and he will not be returned to work, but will be paid appropriately. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 309, 317-18 (1993); <span class="Italic">May v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 422, 424 (1993). In the absence of such documentary evidence, an affidavit or declaration specifying the manner of the agency's compliance with the interim relief order is required. <span class="Italic">May</span>, 57 MSPR at 424.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's January 20, 1993 letter to the appellant, the January 15, 1993 declarations by Morrison and Adams, the January 15, 1993 letter from Morrison to the appellant, and the PS Forms 2240 appeared to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance with the interim relief order. <span class="Italic">See Walker</span>, 59 MSPR at 317; <span class="Italic">May</span>, 57 MSPR at 424. However, the appellant called this evidence into question in his January 26, 1993 declaration in which he asserted that, although he had received Morrison's January 15, 1993 letter, the agency had not actually placed him in a pay status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the show-cause order, the agency proffers copies of the agency's "Payroll Journal" and a copy of an October 28, 1993 declaration by Karl P. Seidel, a Labor Relations Specialist, Westchester Customer Services District, in which Seidel states that the "Payroll Journal" "shows that [the appellant] was paid his regular pay, while in an administrative leave status, beginning on...the date of the Initial Decision in this appeal." The appellant alleges, however, that the "Payroll Journal" shows that the agency has not paid him the entire amount due under the interim relief order. He contends that his first interim relief check was short 80 hours of pay and that the agency placed him on 40 hours of leave without pay (LWOP) in two subsequent pay periods, for a total of 160 hours of pay to which he is allegedly entitled but has not yet received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is uncontested that the appellant received his first check under the interim relief order on or about February 12, 1993. That check purported to represent payment from December 16, 1992 through February 5, 1993, i.e., all pay due the appellant during pay period 27 of 1992 and pay periods 1-3 of 1993. According to the agency's "13-period Year Calendar," that time frame consisted of three Federal holidays and 35 work days. Thus, the agency should have paid the appellant for 24 hours of holiday pay and 280 hours of regular time for a total of 304 hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1689"></span>However, the "Payroll Journal" for pay period 3 of 1993 shows that the agency paid the appellant for only 224 hours, a discrepancy of 80 hours, as the appellant alleged. Moreover, the "Payroll Journal" for that pay period states that the appellant was placed on 80 hours of LWOP during that time period. We also note that the "Payroll Journal" for pay periods 5 and 14 of 1993 shows that the agency placed the appellant on 40 hours of LWOP in each of those pay periods. The appellant allegedly returned to duty on August 2, 1993; all of the apparent LWOP occurred prior to that date. The agency has offered no explanation for the apparent LWOP except the unsworn, unsubstantiated statement in its untimely submission filed after the close of the record on review that the appellant "requested certain pay adjustments because of alleged errors in his weekly pay." As noted above, because the agency has not shown that this submission was based on evidence not readily available before the record on review closed, the Board need not consider it,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, based on the evidence of record, that the agency has not paid the appellant for 160 hours of pay to which he is entitled as interim relief. Thus, we find that the agency has not fully complied with the interim relief order. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">May</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board dismissed an agency PFR for insufficient evidence of interim relief, <span class="Italic">Farmer v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 58 MSPR 58, 60 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">May v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 422, 424 (1993), we held that an agency could satisfy its burden under 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(2) by submitting documentary evidence showing that it had complied with an interim relief order. Examples of acceptable documentary evidence include a Standard Form 50 or 52, "a letter from an agency official to the appellant directing him to return to work and informing him that he ha[d] been reinstated as of the date of the initial decision, or a similar letter to the appellant explaining that he [would] not be brought back to work but [would] be paid appropriately...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted). Alternatively, an agency may satisfy its burden under section 1201.115(b)(2) by submitting an affidavit or a declaration "specifying the manner of the agency's compliance with the interim relief order...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the agency submitted with its petition for review an unsigned memorandum from the agency's representative to other agency offices or officials, asking them to direct an office within the agency to "accomplish as soon a[s] possible an SF-50 Personnel Action to reinstate Mr. Farmer effective January 16, 1992, as a GS-2152-12, Step 5." The letter states further that "[t]he action is for the purpose of reinstatement for pay purposes only and no action should be taken to have Mr. Farmer return to a duty position at this time." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's evidence of compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order is insufficient under <span class="Italic">May</span>. The memorandum from the agency's representative is not acceptable documentary evidence that the agency either has reinstated the appellant with appropriate pay and benefits as of the date of the initial decision, or has taken concrete steps to effect such a personnel action. Further, the agency has not submitted an affidavit or a declaration showing the manner of its compliance with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">May</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was relied on in <span class="Italic">Grover v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 59 MSPR 58, 60-61 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the agency did not comply with 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(1) when it filed its petition for review. Accompanying the agency's petition are two standard forms 52, "Request for Personnel Action" (SF-52). One of the SF-52s requests that the appellant be temporarily promoted effective June 23, 1992, the date of the initial decision, and the other requests that the appellant be suspended effective July 27, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may satisfy its burden under 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(1) by submitting documentary evidence that it has complied with the administrative judge's interim relief order. <span class="Italic">May v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 422, 424 (1993). While an SF-52 may be acceptable documentary evidence, <span class="Italic">id</span>., the SF-52s submitted by the agency in the present appeal are insufficient. The SF-52s do not specify the title, grade, or rate of pay of the position to which the appellant was to be promoted and from which he was to be suspended. Hence, we cannot determine whether the agency has done what it was required to do under the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 432, 434-35 (1994), dismissed the agency's PFR for lack of timely evidence of interim relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the Clerk's show-cause order on interim relief in this appeal, the agency submitted a copy of an SF-50, dated May 27, 1992, documenting that it had restored the appellant's pay effective retroactive to March 20, 1992. "[A]ll that an agency must accomplish by the petition for review filing deadline is to take appropriate administrative action, such as executing an SF-50 or SF-52, which will result in the issuance of a paycheck for the interim relief period."[4] <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 633, 639 (1994). This, the agency has failed to do because the SF-50 was dated over a month after the deadline for filing a petition for review had expired. In addition, the agency's April 20, 1992 letter cannot be considered an "appropriate administrative action" resulting in the issuance of a paycheck since it is merely a statement that the agency intended to take such action. The agency has submitted no evidence showing that it authorized the pay restoration before the expiration of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;An SF-50 or SF-52 is not required in each instance; a memorandum directing a personnel officer to take appropriate action to pay an appellant for the interim relief period would suffice. <span class="Italic">See May</span>, 57 MSPR at 424.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided another example of necessary evidentiary formalities, <span class="Italic">Labatte v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 37, 38 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge ordered the agency to provide the appellant with interim relief if the agency filed a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section 6 of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A). The agency filed its petition for review on the last day of the filing period. In its petition, it stated that the appellant had been reinstated, and would receive pay from the date of the initial decision. Although the agency stated that a standard form 52 (SF-52) accompanied its petition for review, it did not submit the SF-52 or any other evidence of interim relief. On January 30, 1992, the agency resubmitted its petition for review, along with three Notifications of Personnel Actions (SF-50s) addressing various actions affecting the appellant, and purporting to show that the agency provided him with interim relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to the petition for review, the appellant contends in part that the agency failed to comply with the administrative judge's order for interim relief. He has also filed a cross petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's unsworn, unsupported assertions, contained in its petition for review, are insufficient to meet our regulatory requirement that the agency provide "evidence" of interim relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 54 MSPR 116, at 118 (1992). Although the agency attempted to remedy this deficiency, its evidence of interim relief was not timely, in that it was submitted after the period for filing a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 415, 418 (1991). Therefore, we find that the agency has failed to comply with our interim relief regulations. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>

DHHS</span>, DC-0752-14-0707-B-1 (NP 2/27/2023) ("In this case, all the agency has provided is an unsworn statement that it is 'in the process' of providing the appellant back pay and 'will' cancel her resignation and restore her to her position in a nonduty status. This is wholly inadequate to satisfy the agency's interim relief obligations and is a sufficient basis for us to dismiss the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Welch v. Department of Commerce</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 87, 88-90 (1994); <span class="Italic">Labatte v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 37, 38 (1992); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.116(e).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision faulted an agency that relied on its representative's interim relief declaration under pre-1999 regulations, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 61, 62-63 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's timely filed petition for review contains the following statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency representative, in signing this petition for review, hereby swears that the Appellant has been restored to duty in accordance with Public Law 101-12, and the Standard Form (SF-50) certifying this is available for review on request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations provide that, when the administrative judge has ordered the agency to provide interim relief under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A), any petition for review filed by the agency must be accompanied by evidence that the agency has complied with the interim relief order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(1). If the agency fails to submit such evidence of compliance, its petition for review will be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency representative "swears" that the agency has complied with the interim relief order, her statement is not evidence of compliance because it is not in affidavit form or made under penalty of perjury.[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 54 MSPR 116, 118 (1992) (the agency's "certification" of compliance with the interim relief order is merely an allegation of compliance and does not constitute sufficient evidence of compliance), and the cases cited therein. Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency representative's statement constitutes evidence, her general assertion of compliance, without specifics as to the manner in which the agency allegedly complied with the interim relief order, is insufficient to establish appropriate compliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cayocca v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 219, 220-221 (1992). Accordingly, we dismiss the agency's petition for review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note, in addition, that the statement is set forth below the agency representative's signature and is not validated by another signature.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again described an unsworn statement that was insufficient proof of interim relief under pre-1999 regulations, <span class="Italic">Ralph v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 55 MSPR 566, 567 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1690"></span>With its petition for review, the agency has submitted a document entitled "Certificate of Interim Relief." This document consists of one sentence, stating that, according to information provided by an agency employee labor relations specialist, the appellant has been restored to full status that includes pay, compensation, all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment, and has been compensated back to the effective date of the initial decision. This statement is signed by the agency representative. The appellant has responded to the agency's petition by asserting that it should be dismissed, because the "Certificate of Interim Relief" is insufficient evidence of compliance with the administrative judge's order to provide interim relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's "Certificate of Interim Relief" is not evidence of compliance with the administrative judge's order to provide interim relief.

<p class="Body-Text">If an agency's initial submission is ambiguous in some respects but indicates a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of appropriate interim relief, and the agency then demonstrates incomplete interim relief after the period allowed for its PFR, its PFR will be dismissed, <span class="Italic">Welch v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 62 MSPR 87, 88-90 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accompanying the agency's petition for review was purported evidence of compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order. This evidence included a statement that "the Agency is in the process of placing Mr. Welch in a non-work status with full pay and benefits of a ZP-893-IV retroactive [to the date of the initial decision]," an SF-50 effecting such placement, and a letter to the appellant requesting that he supply the agency with his current earnings, to be offset against his federal salary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 54 MSPR 303, 307 (1992), the Board...held further that the agency failed to establish that it complied with the administrative judge's interim relief order within the time period for filing a timely petition for review where, even though the agency submitted an SF-50 indicating that it had placed the employee in a pay status effective as of the date of the initial decision, and a letter stating that it had determined that the employee's return and presence would be unduly disruptive, the agency also included a series of letters informing the employee that he would not be paid until he submitted information concerning his earnings from outside sources, which would be deducted from his interim relief pay. The Board held that evidence, filed well after the last day for filing a timely petition for review, indicating that the agency relied on guidance from OPM for its actions, and that the agency informed the appellant subsequent to its filing of the petition for review that it would not deduct for outside income during the period of interim relief, could not establish that the agency complied with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the agency's petition for review submissions alone, this case differs from <span class="Italic">Mascarenas</span> because the agency did not include, with its petition for review, an unambiguous statement that it would not pay the appellant until he submitted information concerning his earnings from outside sources, although that intention might be inferred from the agency's reference to offset. Recently, in <span class="Italic">Avant v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 467 (1994), the Board held that it will accept evidence of compliance filed after the petition for review deadline in response to a motion to dismiss if the agency timely submitted evidence with its petition for review that was sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance and the agency's later evidence shows that any noncompliance was inadvertent and promptly corrected when its error was discovered. Here, the agency's evidence of compliance, filed with its petition for review, arguably was sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance which would allow the Board to consider its later filed evidence of compliance with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With his motion to dismiss, however, the appellant submitted proof that, as in <span class="Italic">Mascarenas</span>, the agency took the position here that it would not pay the appellant's salary during the interim relief interval unless he provided evidence of his outside earnings, and that the agency maintained that position until sometime after it filed its petition for review. In a letter to the appellant's counsel dated October 13, 1993, subsequent to the time period for filing a petition for review, the agency's representative stated that the appellant "cannot be paid until we receive this [offset] wage information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This evidence clearly rebuts the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance with the interim relief order established by the submissions accompanying the petition for review. Further, the agency's additional evidence of compliance, filed after the petition for review, does not show full compliance in that the record still does not reflect when the appellant finally received interim relief back pay....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency provides <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of proper interim relief, that relief is challenged, and the agency then files supplemental evidence meeting the challenge and demonstrating proper interim relief, its PFR will not be dismissed even if the supplemental evidence was not filed until after the agency's time for filing a PFR expired. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Franklin v. DOJ</span>, 71 MSPR 583, 589 (1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 633, 638 (1996) (the agency "was not required actually to return the appellant to duty by the 35th day, but it was required to take 'concrete steps' to do so no later than then....[a]lternatively, by the 35th day, the agency was required to explain to the appellant that he would not be returned to duty but would receive appropriate pay and benefits, a course that must be based on an undue disruption determination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii)."); <span class="Italic">Harriss v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 427, 431 (1995) ("Documentary evidence such as an SF-50 will suffice to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance with an interim relief order under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)."); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 303, 307 (1995) (SF-50 provides <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance with interim relief order).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite dismissal of some agency PFRs for failure to adequately document interim relief, the Board did not require magic words if the intent of the statute was clearly met. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 309, 317-18 (1993), declined to fault the agency for the manner that it phrased its notice of interim relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the letters did not specifically state that the interim relief it was providing would be effective the date of the initial decision, they did state that, "pursuant to 5 USC Section 7701(b)(2), agency has agreed to provide appellant with 'pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment' <span class="Italic">pending final resolution of its Petition for Review</span>." This language is similar to the language contained in the statute, which provides: "If an agency makes a determination [of undue disruption] that prevents the return or presence of an employee at the place of employment, such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits...<span class="Italic">during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review</span>...." 5 USC 7701(b)(2)(B) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language just quoted from subsection 7701(b)(2)(B) must be read in conjunction with subsection 7701(b)(2)(A), which provides that the employee shall be provided interim relief "effective upon the making of the decision." The "period pending the outcome of any petition for review" therefore commences the date of the initial decision. We find that the agency's statement that it was providing interim relief "pending final resolution of its Petition for Review" implied that such relief would be effective the date of the initial decision.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We note that the Board's regulation is worded differently from the statute, stating that the "evidence must show that the agency provided that the appellant will receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits...<span class="Italic">during the period a petition for review is pending</span>." 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(2). A petition for review cannot be said to be "pending" until it has been filed. A literal reading of the Board's regulation would therefore not require an agency to provide interim relief during the period between the issuance of the initial decision and the filing of the petition for review. We find, however, that such a literal construction would be contrary to the statute, and therefore invalid. The imprecise wording of the regulation, however, provides an additional reason for construing the agency's almost identical language as showing compliance.</p>
