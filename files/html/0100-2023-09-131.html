<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-129"><span class="space">n.</span> OPM Rescinds Reconsideration or Final Decision; Overpayment Recovery; Withdrawal of or Additional Retirement Application; Disputed Retirement Calculations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Annuity appeals ordinarily result from OPM reconsideration decisions that determine benefits, followed by an appeal to the Board. Many appeals move on to adjudication, but in some cases OPM thinks the better of its reconsideration decision after the Board appeal is filed, rescinds the reconsideration decision (generally leaving the annuitant in no better a position than when he initiated the Board appeal), and OPM then moves that the Board appeal be dismissed because there is no underlying appealable reconsideration decision. Over the years the Board issued various and sometimes inconsistent decisions when PFRs challenge these dismissals. The Board may dismiss the appeals as moot, or they may be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, or on rare occasion the appeal might be dismissed with some condition imposed, e.g., the appeal could be refilled if OPM does not issue a new, final reconsideration decision in a set period of time (assuming the appellant is not satisfied with the later OPM decision). The analysis applied to OPM decisions on annuity entitlements are applied to otherwise appealable actions, subsequently rescinded, under other retirement systems. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Regdon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 117 MSPR 348, 2012 MSPB 14 (2012) (employee under a NAFI retirement system transferred to a job covered by FERS and received a determination he desired to challenge an agency decision concerning both his NAFI and FERS benefits). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-020.html#sec2-21">Negative OPM Reconsideration Decision Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or (in older decisions, mootness) may be avoided if the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> is not restored. In the ordinary annuity appeal, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> is a lack of benefits or a protest over nonpayment of a benefit. Dismissal of the appeal to await another reconsideration decision theoretically leaves the appellant no worse than before--no benefits or no sum immediately <span id="Page_1057"></span>owed as an overpayment. The Board is unconcerned with the problem of the appellant whose benefit entitlement is delayed by OPM's practice of rescinding reconsideration decisions. If, however, the appellant lost money as a result of OPM's action, as in the case of partial recovery by OPM of a disputed overpayment, then to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending a mootness dismissal and issuance of another reconsideration decision, OPM would have to restore to the appellant the recouped funds. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zelznick v. OPM</span>, PH-0845-16-0129-I-1 (NP 9/2/2016) ("The appellant had the opportunity to reply to OPM's claim that it reimbursed him, but he did not do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(a)(4). Thus, he has failed to meet his jurisdictional burden of identifying any other basis on which to find that the Board retains jurisdiction over this appeal despite OPM's rescission. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 10 (2013) (finding that OPM did not fully rescind its final decision because, in pertinent part, it failed to refund the appellant funds withheld in satisfaction of an overpayment of retirement benefits). Further, we find that the appellant's claim that the $100 withholding and OPM repayment schedule violated his due process rights is not a basis for Board jurisdiction over the November 2015 reconsideration decision."); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. OPM</span>, 123 MSPR 240, 2016 MSPB 11 (2016) (appeal remanded to determine if OPM refunded funds recovered to satisfy a portion of an overpayment that may have belonged to appellant, the recipient of a survivor annuity; if the funds were hers and not restored, the appeal remained viable despite OPM's rescission of the underlying overpayment decision); <span class="Italic">Martin v. OPM</span>, 119 MSPR 188, 193 &#x00B6; 10, 2013 MSPB 13 (2013) ("...OPM does not dispute, that she has not received repayment of the funds that have already been withheld from her OWCP benefits.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Having reviewed the parties' submissions, we find that OPM has completely rescinded its reconsideration decision and restored the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, OPM has indicated that it intends to issue a new decision concerning the alleged overpayment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, although the AJ dismissed the instant appeal, he did so on the grounds that OPM's representations in its motion to dismiss rendered the appeal moot.

OPM asserts that it is rescinding its reconsideration decision and granting the appellant's disability retirement annuity retroactive to her last day in a pay status.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board did not cite or overrule precedent in <span class="Italic">Frank</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and pre-<span class="Italic">Frank</span> decisions are noted below. Reader discretion is advised, since it is unclear what the Board's true approach is or will be as to appeals involving OPM reconsideration decisions that are rescinded after the appeal is filed. Whether dismissed as moot or for lack of jurisdiction, the prospective annuitant can be placed in a poor position when OPM rescinds a reconsideration decision and an appeal is dismissed without a time limit for future OPM adjudication. In a typical adverse action case the appeal is moot if the agency rescinds the action and completely restores the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante,</span> that is, puts the appellant back to work and provides necessary backpay adjustments. The appellant has received (with exceptions noted in the decisions) the reinstatement and back pay he could have received were the appeal litigated to a successful conclusion. In a retirement appeal, the appellant is seeking augmentation or establishment of a benefit. If the benefit exists at all, it is vested in the sense that it was earned through years of federal service. A retiree may well depend upon the benefit to pay for life's necessities. One might think that a retirement appeal would be accorded expeditious treatment by the Board. However, the Board has allowed these appeals to be dismissed without a merits determination when OPM states that it is going to rescind the annuity reconsideration decision (or other final decision of OPM) under appeal and issue another decision at some undefined later date. As the discussion in this section shows, the Board allows this result by dismissing the appeal as moot or for lack of jurisdiction when OPM states it is rescinding the decision on appeal in favor of a promised later decision. The annuitant or beneficiary is left to the tender mercy of OPM while he awaits the next OPM decision and possible next Board appeal. The Board's approach on retention or loss of jurisdiction in retirement appeals is in need of correction to avoid undue delay in the resolution of claims for retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Curiously, in olden days, early in its history, the Board did not permit manipulation of the adjudication process by OPM's interest in readjudication of appealed decisions. Consider <span class="Italic">Toppi v. OPM</span>, 2 MSPR 193, 194 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1059"></span>Appellant's disability retirement request was denied by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), whereupon he filed a timely appeal with this Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d). Along with the petition, appellant submitted a new medical report which contained information not available to OPM when it rejected the claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reviewing that report, OPM filed a motion requesting the Board to remand the case to it for further consideration because the report raises "new substantive questions about Mr. Toppi's health and the correctness of the rejection which, in fairness to him, require further evaluation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The motion is DENIED. OPM is entirely free during the pendency of proceedings before the Board to reconsider its earlier decision in light of all available medical information and to take whatever action it may deem appropriate as a result. Should OPM upon such reconsideration decide to reverse its earlier decision and approve the application, it may then move to dismiss the appeal before the Board as moot. Meanwhile, the Board finds no reason to delay resolution of appellant's appeal from OPM's earlier determination which remains effective. If the Board were obliged to remand such appeals to OPM whenever a new medical report materializes, the effective date of OPM's determination could be delayed indefinitely, thereby defeating the appellant's right of appeal, or the appellant would be deprived of his statutory right to present all relevant evidence to the Board. OPM as a party to the Board proceeding will have full opportunity to present its views to the Board with respect to all medical information in the Board's record.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wiley v. MSPB</span>, 406 Fed. Appx. 488, 491-92 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), the Board's reviewing court considered whether the appeal of Mr. Wiley was from a final OPM decision and, if so, whether the Board lost jurisdiction over the appeal based on OPM's attempted rescission of the appealed decision and promise to issue a subsequent decision. The court questioned the ability of the Board to dismiss the appeal as moot based on OPM's postappeal actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second issue on appeal is whether the dismissal below was proper because OPM rescinded its October 2008 decision and stated that it would issue a new decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appeal that has been properly brought before the Board can be rendered moot by an agency's complete rescission of its decision, thus divesting the Board of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Kagel v. Dep't of Army,</span> 126 F.3d 1455, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("The Board may dismiss an appeal as moot if the appealable action is canceled or rescinded by the agency. The agency's rescission of the appealable action, however, must be complete in order for the appeal to be deemed moot and to relieve the Board of its statutory obligation to decide the appeal." (internal citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Simply stated, a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer 'live' or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome." <span class="Italic">Powell v. McCormack,</span> 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969). Indeed,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[J]urisdiction, properly acquired, may abate if the case becomes moot because</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1)&#x2003;it can be said with assurance that "there is no reasonable expectation..." that the alleged violation will recur, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">2)&#x2003;interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When both conditions are satisfied it may be said that the case is moot because neither party has a legally cognizable interest in the final determination of the underlying questions of fact and law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">County of Los Angeles v. Davis,</span> 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (internal citations omitted). Thus, if neither OPM nor Wiley has "a legally cognizable interest in the final determination of the underlying questions of fact and law," the Board's dismissal of Wiley's appeal was proper.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's submission to the Administrative Judge rescinding its October 2008 letter, however, did not "irrevocably eradicate [&#8197;] the effects of the alleged violation." Rather, it left Wiley awaiting a determination by OPM as to whether his annuity has been (and continues to be) properly reduced by a survivor annuity. Certainly, then, Wiley continues to have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome, and OPM's unilateral rescission of its October 2008 determination did not moot Wiley's appeal. <span class="Italic">See also Fernandez v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 443, 446 (2007) (concluding that an appellant's sworn statement that the agency had not paid him all appropriate back pay constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that his appeal is not moot and must first be resolved before the appeal could be properly dismissed); <span class="Italic">see also Hagan v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. &#x00B6; 6 (2005) ("If an agency fails to completely rescind an appealed action, the Board will retain jurisdiction over the underlying action. Furthermore, the proper remedy, if an employee has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, is for the Board to retain jurisdiction and adjudicate the appeal on the merits.") For the Board to have reached a contrary conclusion was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, on remand, the Board must first determine whether OPM's 2008 letter was an appealable action, that is, should it be treated as a final decision by OPM. If the Board concludes that it was, the Board must reach the merits of Wiley's appeal.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The AJ may remand a retirement claim on appeal back to OPM for a new reconsideration decision. A PFR from the appellant on the merits of the retirement dispute will then not be adjudicated, but MSPB may direct OPM to decide the issues remanded. E.g., <span class="italic">Williams v. OPM</span>, CH-0831-17-0237-I-1 (NP 4/26/2023).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board states it places a "high priority" on resolution of annuity appeals. <span class="Italic">Ott v. OPM</span>, 120 MSPR 453, 456 &#x00B6; 8, 2013 MSPB 99 (2013) (disability annuity appeal). Time will tell whether the Board applies <span class="Italic">Wiley</span> in an effort to do substantial justice to appellants with annuity appeals, while preserving some flexibility for OPM to reexamine its decisions. A better approach would be for the Board to dismiss an annuity appeal without prejudice to its refiling (DWOP), on OPM's motion, for a fixed period of time to permit OPM to issue another decision and, if no decision is issued, for the Board to adjudicate the case on the merits if that is then the appellant's choice or, if another decision is issued, to permit the appellant to continue with the original appeal as amended to meet the circumstances of the later OPM decision. We add that considering the casual treatment of its jurisdiction over OPM retirement decisions, involving arguably vested retirement benefits for an aging population of annuitants, it is particularly unfortunate that the Board so rigidly imposes strict time limits on appellants whose retirement appeals or PFRs from initial decisions on those appeals are a week or two late.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1060"></span>The Federal Circuit had no quarrel with an MSPB dismissal based on OPM's rescission of a reconsideration decision in <span class="Italic">Anthony v. OPM</span>, 524 Fed. Appx. 634, 635-36 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Anthony retired from the United States Postal Service in June 2006. In January 2009, he asked OPM to convert his retirement status from optional to retirement based on disability. OPM approved his request and recalculated his annuity retroactive to June 2006. As a result, Mr. Anthony was paid $9,436.31 in additional annuity benefits that had accrued but had not been paid between June 2006 and August 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Anthony disputed the recalculation. In September 2009, OPM recomputed his annuity, determined that it was correct, and provided Mr. Anthony with supporting documentation. Mr. Anthony requested reconsideration of OPM's initial decision, and on February 14, 2012, OPM responded to that request and upheld its initial decision. OPM's letter stated that it represented "the final decision of OPM" and was appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Anthony filed a timely appeal to the Board. On March 20, 2012, however, OPM sent a letter informing the administrative judge that the agency was "rescinding [its] February 14, 2012, reconsideration decision" and stating that the case would be sent to a particular section within OPM to re-address the amount of Mr. Anthony's annuity after he switched to disability retirement. The letter promised that "[n]ew reconsideration rights will be given" following that decision, and it requested that the Board dismiss Mr. Anthony's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal. Citing <span class="Italic">Gale v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 54, 56 (1993), and <span class="Italic">Bernardino v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 615, 617 (1992), the administrative judge held that "there is no final decision of OPM from which [Mr. Anthony] may appeal and the Board no longer retains jurisdiction over the appeal." In August 2012, the full Board denied Mr. Anthony's petition for review. It explained that OPM had the authority to correct its previous decisions and that OPM's determination to rescind its reconsideration decision divested the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal. The Board also noted that "[w]hen OPM issues a new final or reconsideration decision, [Mr. Anthony] may file a new appeal if he disagrees with [it]." Mr. Anthony appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual whose rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement System are affected by a "final decision" of OPM may appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.110, 841.308; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8347(d)(1), 8461(e)(1). Reconsideration decisions qualify as such final, appealable decisions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.109(f); 841.306(e). We have recognized, however, that OPM may "mak[e] an administrative decision to correct what it viewed as its previous mistaken and unlawful award." <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 87 F.3d 471, 475 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Because OPM's rescission of a reconsideration decision effectively erases that decision, the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from a rescinded decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nebblett v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 237 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 136 F.3d 1474, 1476 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Baniaga v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">That is what happened here. Mr. Anthony appealed OPM's decision regarding the calculation of his annuity benefits, and the agency subsequently rescinded that decision on appeal. OPM stated that it was revisiting the calculation and that "[n]ew reconsideration rights will be given" after it has done so. The Board subsequently explained that Mr. Anthony may appeal from OPM's new decision if he disagrees with it, and, in its brief to this court, the government makes clear that Mr. Anthony "is now free to press his claim with OPM that the annuity calculation is incorrect." Because the OPM decision about which Mr. Anthony complains no longer has legally operable effect, the Board correctly determined that there was no final decision for it to review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without delving into when and how a case becomes moot, <span class="Italic">Keira v. MSPB</span>, 396 Fed. Appx. 703, 704-05 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), approved the Board's practice of dismissing annuity appeals when OPM rescinds its underlying reconsideration decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual whose rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System are affected by a "final decision" of OPM may appeal the decision to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110; <span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 131, 133 (1997). For the Board to have jurisdiction over such an appeal, there must be a final decision of OPM. <span class="Italic">Tatum v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 96, 99 (1999). A "final decision" is a decision that OPM issues after a request for reconsideration of an initial decision, i.e., a reconsideration decision, or a decision that OPM designates as a final decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If OPM completely rescinds a reconsideration decision, the Board no longer has jurisdiction over the appeal in which that decision is at issue and must dismiss the appeal. <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 237 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 136 F.3d 1474, 1476 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 259, 261 (2010). The Board, however, has recognized a limited exception to this general rule under circumstances in which "dismissal of the appeal could effectively prevent an appellant from obtaining an adjudication of his claim." <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 536, 546-47 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Richards v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 310, 312 (1985). The Board has found this exception applicable where it appeared that OPM had no intention of issuing a reconsideration decision or other further decision in the case. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 547; <span class="Italic">Richards</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. at 312. Moreover, the Board has recognized that the exception applies where OPM "improperly failed to respond to the appellant's repeated requests for a decision." <span class="Italic">McNeese v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 70, 74 (1994); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 160, 161 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because OPM completely rescinded its reconsideration decision and has not yet issued a new reconsideration decision, we agree with the Board's determination that it did not have jurisdiction over Keira's appeal. We, like the Board, conclude that the circumstances of this case do not fall under the recognized exception to the general rule, requiring an OPM reconsideration decision for the Board to have jurisdiction over an appeal, or warrant another exception to this rule. In contrast to cases like <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 536 (1994) and <span class="Italic">Richards v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 310 (1985), in which it appeared that OPM had no intention of issuing a further decision, OPM here has repeatedly stated its intent to issue a new reconsideration decision in its motion to dismiss Keira's appeal and its declaration outlining the procedure being followed to determine the proper payee. Further, OPM has not improperly failed to respond to Keira's requests for a decision and instead has provided a reason for the delay in issuing a reconsideration decision. Specifically, OPM has explained that it is waiting on additional evidence from the competing claimants for the lump sum death benefits and, whether it receives the evidence or not, it will determine the proper payee and issue a new reconsideration decision. Under these circumstances where OPM is still processing Keira's claim, dismissal of Keira's appeal will not "effectively prevent [him] from obtaining an adjudication of his claim." <span class="Italic">See McLaughlin</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 546-47.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the delay in resolution of this case is unfortunate for Keira and his siblings. Yet this is a complex case, which involves multiple claimants and paternity as well as sibling determinations regarding a deceased individual. Further, it is important that OPM make a fully informed decision to ensure its correctness because it is difficult for OPM to recover lump sum benefits once paid. In light of these circumstances and OPM's representations that it intends to issue a reconsideration decision and is seeking additional evidence from the competing claimants, we cannot conclude that OPM has constructively denied Keira's benefits. <span class="Italic">See McNeese</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 74 (concluding that delay in issuing reconsideration decision of more than sixteen months did not warrant application of the exception where OPM's only explanation for the delay was its workload and substantial backlog of cases).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board properly found that, without a reconsideration decision from OPM, it did not have jurisdiction over Keira's appeal. We trust and expect that OPM will act expeditiously to bring resolution to this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ogburn v. MSPB</span>, 750 Fed. Appx. 990, 992 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Board correctly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. As an initial matter, Ogburn's reference to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2), which governs appellate procedures at the Board, is misplaced, as it is Ogburn's burden to first establish the Board's jurisdiction. Moreover, it is undisputed that after Ogburn appealed OPM's final decision to the Board, OPM rescinded its final decision. Contrary to Ogburn's contention, the Board considered OPM's rescission and correctly concluded that rescission deprived the Board of jurisdiction. As noted by the Board and the government, with respect to Ogburn's claim concerning computation of her disability retirement annuity benefits, the Board only has jurisdiction over OPM's decisions that are final. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8347(d), 8461(e); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.110, 841.308. After OPM rescinded its October 31, 2017 final decision, there was no final OPM decision that would confer jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">See Snyder v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 136 F.3d 1474, 1476 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, as the Board noted, nothing in the record suggests that OPM does not intend to issue a new reconsideration decision after its rescission, which may allow the Board to retain jurisdiction according to its precedent. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 152 F.3d 948 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (table) (requiring OPM to issue a final reconsideration decision within thirty days as it had promised to the appellant and acknowledging that the appellant and OPM were involved in a "prolonged dialogue" and that there was an "extended delay" of five years although "the record does not indicate that OPM inexplicably and repeatedly refused to issue a reconsideration decision"). Finally, we agree with the government that Ogburn, as an ODNI employee, is excluded from the reach of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and the Board therefore lacked jurisdiction over Ogburn's claims of involuntary retirement action and negative suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See Lal v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 821 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I), 2306; 50 <span id="Page_1061"></span>U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3024(m)(1), (2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The confusion caused by MSPB's continuing tolerance of the indefinite delays entailed by OPM's treatment of its own retirement decisions, to the extent they invest and the divest the Board's jurisdiction, was hinted at by <span class="Italic">Gienec v. OPM,</span> SF-0831-10-0318-I-1 (NP 9/22/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a final decision issued on December 7, 2009, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) determined that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a), the appellant was not eligible to receive the deferred retirement benefits he sought based on his service under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) because he had filed an application for refund of his retirement deductions on August 20, 1990, and a refund was authorized on November 1, 1990. On appeal, the appellant insisted that he never applied for a refund of his retirement contributions and never received a refund. During adjudication of the appeal, OPM notified the administrative judge and the appellant that it was rescinding its December 7, 2009 decision and moved that the appeal be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. OPM indicated that, once the appeal was dismissed, it would "perform another review of the file, and, if necessary, issue a new decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, although noting the appellant's objection, the administrative judge found that OPM had completely rescinded its final decision and that the action divested the Board of jurisdiction and required that the appeal be dismissed without prejudice to the appellant's right to file a new appeal of any subsequent final or reconsideration decision. On petition for review, the appellant argues that, under the circumstances present in this case, OPM's statement that it has rescinded its final decision effectively prevents him from pursuing this matter and therefore does not divest the Board of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate an individual's rights and remedies under the CSRS only after OPM has rendered a reconsideration decision on the issue in question, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 118, &#x00B6; 10 (2010), and where, as here, OPM rescinds its reconsideration decision, the rescission divests the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal, and the appeal must be dismissed, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 259, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). The Board has recognized an exception to the general rule, however, and held that it may take jurisdiction over a retirement appeal in the absence of a reconsideration decision where the individual has made repeated unsuccessful requests for OPM to issue a decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 118, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Settlers v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 105, &#x00B6; 9 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant states that, because he perceived OPM's letter as "noncommittal, vague and imprecise" with regard to its intention, he attempted to seek clarification from its representative as to the meaning of the language in the March 25, 2010 letter stating that "if necessary, [OPM will] issue a new decision," but that, despite several efforts to communicate his concerns, he received no response. OPM has not addressed the appellant's claim in its response to his petition for review. Notwithstanding the appellant's claims, we find it premature at this point to make a determination that OPM does not intend to issue a new decision. However, if, in the future, evidence indicates that OPM does not intend to issue a new decision addressing the matter at issue, the appellant may ask the Board to take jurisdiction under the theory described above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When OPM completely rescinds an appealed retirement determination, mootness is not avoided by the existence of disputes related or collateral to the underlying appeal, <span class="Italic">Parkin v. OPM</span>, 103 MSPR 468, 470-72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8, 2006 MSPB 286 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) denied appellant's application for disability retirement but reconsidered during the processing of appellant's appeal challenging that denial. The administrative judge assigned to the case dismissed appellant's appeal, finding that because OPM had granted appellant's application for disability, he had received all the relief sought in the appeal and therefore the appeal was moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed a petition for enforcement, asserting that OPM had not disbursed his monthly annuity and requested that the underlying appeal "be reopened so that an appropriate order directing payment of benefits be entered." OPM subsequently sent four checks to appellant but appellant stated that they were not made out to the representative payee. He also questioned the agency's calculations of benefits, requested counsel fees for the enforcement action, asked that counsel's previous bill be approved for chargeability to appellant, and asked for interest to be assessed on OPM's late payments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the issues of nonpayment of the annuity and payment to an incorrect payee appeared to be resolved. The administrative judge also declined to award fees on several bases. Additionally, the administrative judge denied appellant's request that interest be assessed on OPM's late payments based on the absence of any authority supporting the imposition of interest in these circumstances. The administrative judge concluded that, to be in compliance, OPM must present calculations of appellant's annuity demonstrating that the retroactive annuity benefits paid and the monthly benefit are correct, including an explanation of the deduction for health care benefits between the effective date of the commencement of appellant's annuity and the time payment was first made. The administrative judge also directed OPM to address appellant's concern that all future payments be made to the proper payee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM responded that the Board lacks jurisdiction over appellant's challenge to the calculation of his annuity because OPM has not issued a decision on this issue, the Board lacks jurisdiction to address health insurance issues because the Board lacks authority to grant relief in this area, and OPM's files contain the name of a representative payee for appellant. Appellant agreed that the representative payee issue was fully resolved but questioned OPM's right to raise a jurisdictional challenge at this stage of the proceedings and asked that the Board direct OPM to provide an adequate explanation of its calculations. In the alternative, appellant requested that the Board refer the calculation issue to OPM and dismiss the current action without prejudice to refile in the event that appellant is dissatisfied with OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority to issue enforcement orders derives from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1) and (2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, appellant appealed OPM's reconsideration decision denying him disability benefits, but OPM rescinded its denial during the course of the MSPB appeal.

Accordingly, the Board lacked jurisdiction to order compliance in this case.[3] Further, because jurisdiction may be raised at any time, it was not error for OPM to raise this issue in response to the administrative judge's decision recommending compliance. <span class="Italic">See Kostishak v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that appellant's request for reopening constitutes an argument that OPM failed to completely rescind its denial of a disability annuity, appellant's request is denied. Appellant does not dispute that OPM has made payments to him consistent with its determination to grant him a disability annuity.

If an appeal is dismissed as moot based on an OPM letter stating that its reconsideration decision was rescinded and the appellant will receive the relief requested, the remedy of the appellant, should OPM not provide the promised relief, is to reopen the appeal (through PFR) and seek remand of the appeal to the regional office.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hundley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 632, &#x00B6; 9 (1999), the Board held that where OPM was constrained by law to decide the matter at issue as it did, there was no act on its part that could be shown to be discriminatory, but that was not the case where it had discretion to act. In <span class="Italic">Hundley,</span> the Board found that an overpayment waiver determination involves the exercise of discretion. Thus, although OPM's decision as to the existence and amount of an overpayment may be constrained by law and, therefore, not subject to a claim of discrimination, the Board has the authority to consider an allegedly discriminatory decision not to waive an overpayment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10.</p>

Here, however, the record is not developed enough to determine whether the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination based on her claims of race and disability discrimination and retaliation. We find that, to satisfy the appellant's due process rights, it is necessary to remand the case to require that the administrative judge notify her of her burden of proof on her discrimination claims before adjudicating the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the dispute before the Board is a challenge to an OPM retirement determination, the appellant's withdrawal of his retirement application moots the appeal. <span class="Italic">Woodrough v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 633, 635 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Baniaga v. OPM</span>, 86 MSPR 207, 209-10 &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (appeal was moot when OPM found the appellant eligible for an annuity and rescinded an early reconsideration decision).

OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 453, 456-57 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We deny OPM's motion to dismiss this appeal because the appellant has filed a second application for disability retirement. OPM's motion is based on the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Harris v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 606, 609 (the employee's appeal of OPM's denial of his application for disability retirement as a Distribution Clerk was moot due to his filing of a second application for disability retirement from the Distribution and Window Clerk position to which he was currently assigned), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 979 F.2d 217 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, however, is factually distinguishable in that that appeal was moot because, in view of the employee's change of position, any Board decision on the disability retirement application would relate to the employee's ability to perform in a position other than the one he presently occupied. <span class="Italic">Id</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Briese v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPB 1, 8 MSPR 298, 299-300 (1981). There is no evidence or argument in this appeal that the appellant has been assigned to a different position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appeal is moot only when the issues it raises are no longer "live" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the litigation<span class="Italic">. See Perisho v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 55, 58 (1995). Here, OPM has not presented any evidence regarding the alleged date of disability in the appellant's second application for disability retirement or any indication that the second application, in fact, is based upon the same disability asserted by her in the first application. Further, OPM may find in the second application that the appellant is disabled but at a later date than that covered by her first application, thus depriving her of benefits that she would receive if she were found disabled in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 844.301. We note that this appeal could be rendered moot if OPM rescinded the reconsideration decision, thereby divesting the Board of jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Franklin v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 168, 169 (1994); <span class="Italic">Gale v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 54, 56 (1993). However, OPM has not rescinded its reconsideration decision. Thus, there is a live issue currently before the Board with regard to this appeal concerning the appellant's first application for disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If OPM grants the annuity during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal is moot. <span class="Italic">Cooper v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 81, 82 (1984). An appeal from a denial by OPM of waiver of an annuity overpayment is moot once OPM subsequently grants the waiver request. Collection efforts by OPM that were terminated do not keep the controversy alive. <span class="Italic">Mayzlik v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 331, 333 (1992); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 282, 283 n.1 (1984) (disability appeal was mooted by the grant of an annuity despite the appellant's contention that his employing agency's revocation of his pilot's licenses and the imposition of LWOP were part of the appeal; "[w]e can discern no basis to conclude that these actions by the appellant's agency must be deemed a part of his appeal of OPM's denial of his disability retirement application.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ should not dismiss a retirement appeal as moot only because OPM asserts that the appellant's claim is incorrect or invalid, or that his appeal would result in no change in his retirement status or benefits. The appellant is entitled to an adjudication if she disputes OPM's position. The Board explained, somewhat indirectly, the significance of adjudication of retirement claims, <span class="Italic">Dudar v. OPM</span>, 85 MSPR 579, 580-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective July 3, 1998, the appellant received an optional retirement from his position, based on having met the age and service requirements for that benefit, although it is undisputed that his retirement was prompted by his failing health. Following kidney replacement surgery, he recovered and was subsequently returned to his former position as a reemployed annuitant, the status that attaches upon the return to the rolls of an optionally retired individual. Contemporaneous with his June 22, 1998 return to duty, he filed an application with OPM, seeking a retroactive determination that his retirement was based on his disability, so that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, upon his return he would be deemed an "employee" instead. He claimed that he had originally asked his employer, the Social Security Administration (SSA), to help him pursue such a request, but that he had been persuaded by SSA and his failing health to retire optionally instead.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's final decision dismissed his claim as moot, "[s]ince the annuity option under optional retirement provisions is equal to what you would receive should we approve you for disability."...&#8197;On appeal, the Board's administrative judge affirmed OPM's decision, relying on that agency's statement that it had determined that the appellant's benefit would have been the same under either basis for retirement, and that his only cognizable interest is "a payroll change" in his current employment, not a "legal benefit from the retirement fund."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant takes issue with the administrative judge's reliance on OPM's statement as to the amount he would have been paid under disability retirement, and claims that he has a legally cognizable interest that prevents his appeal from being moot. He reiterates his desire to have the basis for his temporary retirement changed so as to effect the above-noted change in his current status. The agency has responded in support of its position, as affirmed in the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 8347(d), insofar as it is relevant here, an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under this subchapter [5 USC Chapter 83, subchapter III, "Civil Service Retirement"] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.110 ("an individual or agency whose rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System...are affected by a final decision of the representative of the Associate Director for Compensation, Office of Personnel Management, may request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review such decision in accord with procedures prescribed by the Board"). The term "rights or interests" appears to be a broad grant of authority, and has been interpreted in a manner consistent with that view. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Department of State v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 22 MSPR 404 (1984) (interpreting the law as allowing an appeal by an employing agency of an OPM determination as to whether certain of its employees are entitled to current service credit and eventual retirement under the provisions benefiting law enforcement officers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specific sections of the civil service retirement law apply to the appellant's situation, i.e., 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337, concerning disability retirement and the effect of recovery from the disabling condition, and &#x00A7; 8344, setting the rules for "[a]nnuities and pay on reemployment" respect to optionally retired employees, from which recovered disability annuitants are exempted by 5 USC &#x00A7; 8344(a)(1). Indeed, the Board has often had occasion to review the status of appellants under section 8344, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Vacchiano v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 MSPR 1, 5 (1991) (asserting authority over a retroactive claim for a change in status following reemployment where OPM took the position that once it has awarded an annuity to an individual, he remains an "annuitant" despite his eligibility for federal workers' compensation benefits); <span class="Italic">Saxton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 MSPR 46, 49 (1991) (sustaining OPM's decision that the appellant was a reemployed annuitant); <span class="Italic">True v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 44 MSPR 251, 254-55 (1990) (denying the appellant's request for revocation of his status as an annuitant), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 926 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1991). These cases concern individuals who were either optional retirees, as was the appellant here, or disability annuitants, as he seeks to be declared, and in each, the Board made a determination on the merits of the appellant's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although much emphasis has been placed on one of the reasons the appellant wishes to change his status to other than that of a reemployed annuitant (its effect on his former wife's entitlement to a portion of his current salary in its guise as an annuity), we find any such motivation irrelevant because he makes a valid claim to a redetermination of his status, regardless of any potential effect in that regard. The motivation for seeking a change in status has often been a financial one; that fact, however, is simply no basis for a conclusion that the appellant lacks a legally cognizable "right" or "interest" in the characterization of his service upon recovery and reemployment, or for a holding that he is seeking only a "payroll" change rather than one based in his retirement rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sakran v. Macy,</span> 218 F. Supp. 756, 757 (D.D.C. 1963), remanding <span id="Page_1063"></span>to the former Civil Service Commission under a predecessor statute to section 8344 an appellant's claim of entitlement "to have his status as a 'reemployed annuitant' terminated, and to be recognized as a regular Federal employee, entitled to all rights and benefits now available to regular Federal employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, too, that the administrative judge accepted OPM's statement that the appellant's financial entitlement during the period he was retired would have been the same if he had retired under section 8337, under the apparent, but mistaken, belief that the appellant does not challenge OPM's position on that matter. There is, however, no record evidence of the results of a comparison between the two methods of computation supportive of such a conclusion. Nor would any such finding that the amounts would have been identical address the appellant's claim that his eventual benefit, upon his final retirement from the service, would be greatly enhanced because his health will not permit him to work the entire period necessary for a former optionally retired employee (but not one retired under the disability provisions of the law) to be entitled to a redetermined annuity. In fact, the differences between the rules as to reemployed disability annuitants and those once retired on other bases are numerous under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8344. Further, to the extent that the parties may have interpreted <span class="Italic">Kozer</span>, 45 MSPR at 507, as a ruling that an appellant may never be entitled to an enhanced benefit in a reclassification of his annuity from optional to disability-based, we do not read the holding there as more than one that this was the result for the specific individual involved, who did not return to work and pointed only to a desire "to be judged disabled for the record" as his interest in pursuing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although we note OPM's assertion that the appellant may not, in fact, be entitled to a disability retirement annuity, any such claim at this point is both speculative and irrelevant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">DoPadre v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 MSPR 346, 352 (1996) (that the extent of the Board's review must be constrained by state law is not a reason to find that it lacks authority to review OPM's application in an individual case); <span class="Italic">True</span>, 44 MSPR at 254-55 (denying the appellant's request for a retroactive change in his annuitant status, but on its merits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ORDER</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we remand the appeal to OPM and ORDER it to issue a decision on the merits of the appellant's case, subject to a second appeal to the Board if he is dissatisfied with its outcome....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Additionally, regardless of whether OPM properly deducted the appellant’s FEGLI premiums from its retroactive annuity payment, we find that the current record is insufficiently developed to dismiss this appeal as moot. OPM’s assertion that it has reinstated the appellant’s annuity does not establish that his annuity payment has been calculated correctly and that he has received all of the relief to which he is entitled. <span class="Italic">See Fernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 10 (2007). The appellant has the right to the information relied upon by OPM to calculate its annuity determinations, and as OPM has sole access to that information, the Board expects OPM to provide it. <span class="Italic">Harlston v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 4 (2008). Because OPM has so far declined to provide such information, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal for the administrative judge to determine whether the appellant has received all of the relief that he could have received if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed. <span class="Italic">See Sanders v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 229, 233-34 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, the Board will not order OPM to avoid a potential problem concerning annuity status, <span class="italic">Suchak v. OPM, supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant requests that the Board confirm his right to receive the disability annuity to ensure that OPM will not terminate his annuity in the future. He asserts that his request is in line with <span class="italic">Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater</span>, 528 U.S. 216, 222 (2000) and <span class="italic">United States v. Concentrated Phospate Export Association, Inc</span>., 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968). In <span class="italic">Adarand Constructors</span>, the Court held that "[v]oluntary cessation of challenged conduct moots a case only if it is 'absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.'" 528 U.S. at 222 (quoting <span class="italic">Concentrated Phosphate</span>, 393 U.S. at 203) (emphasis omitted). We find this doctrine inapplicable to the circumstances of this appeal. In <span class="italic">Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc</span>., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013), the Court explained that the purpose of this "voluntary cessation" doctrine is to prevent a defendant from only temporarily ceasing his unlawful conduct "when sued to have the case declared moot, then pick up where he left off, repeating this cycle until he achieves all his unlawful ends." We see no risk of OPM acting in this manner here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the issue in this appeal is OPM's decision to terminate the appellant's annuity. Although the appellant requests that the Board verify his eligibility for restoration of his annuity, or his eligibility to a new annuity, in the event that he is separated from the Navy the Board is not authorized to issue a declaratory order or an advisory opinion in these circumstances. <span class="italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h); <span class="italic">Blaha v.
