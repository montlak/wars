<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-261"><span class="space">e.</span> Evidence of Intent: Theft and Unauthorized Possession</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Exclusive and unexplained possession of another's property creates an inference of theft. <span class="Italic">Mojica-Otero v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 30 MSPR 46, 49 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Messersmith v. GSA</span>, 9 MSPR 150, 158 (1981) ("The courts...have generally instructed juries that an inference of the necessary guilty knowledge may be drawn from the fact of the possession of such goods, without a plausible explanation[.] "). However, a charge of taking government property cannot be sustained on just the testimony of an employee who, seeing relatively common materials in the possession of the appellant, assumes that those materials belong to the government. <span class="Italic">Amell v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPR 531, 534, 7 MSPB 382 (1981). Poor judgment does not equate to intent to steal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lacapurcia v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 514, 519 (1985) (appellant, fearing the theft of expensive equipment, took the agency's calculator home for safekeeping and brought his cheaper model into the office; the appellant's conduct did not equate to the misappropriation of government property).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A charge of theft was sustained on circumstantial evidence concerning the treatment of the property of another employee, <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Army,</span> DC-0752-10-0069-I-1 (NP 4/6/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed his removal based on charges of theft of a privately owned weapon, interference with an official investigation, and failure to follow standard operating procedures. The appellant argues on review that he had no intent to steal the gun and that there is no evidence that he attempted to permanently take it from Johnson. Beyond the appellant's own testimony that he did not intend to keep Johnson's gun, the only evidence to support the appellant's assertion in this regard is his contemporaneous statement to Sgt. Kimbrough regarding his concern for Sgt. Johnson were the gun to be turned in. The remaining evidence shows, however, that the appellant took Johnson's gun from the car and off the military base to his own house with no subsequent effort to either return it or turn it in. Although the appellant asserts that he intended to return the gun to Johnson when he asked for it and he testified that he "would eventually have given Johnson back his gun," the appellant made no effort to advise Johnson that he had removed the gun from Johnson's car to prevent him from any further trouble. Furthermore, even though the appellant claims that he expected Sgt. Kimbrough to tell Johnson that he had secured the weapon for safekeeping, the appellant never told Sgt. Kimbrough that he intended to return the weapon to Johnson. Nor did the appellant ever ask Sgt. Kimbrough to tell Johnson that he had the weapon. It was not until the appellant was questioned on July 22, two days later, that he acknowledged to anyone that he had the weapon. And even then, when the appellant was first asked by Investigator Smith if he knew of the missing gun, the appellant did not speak up, but waited 30-45 minutes later to approach him to tell him that he had Johnson's gun.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an individual is charged with a theft offense, and intent becomes material, the failure to follow proper procedures concerning the property is part of the circumstantial evidence to show intent, but that failure alone does not establish wrongful intent. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 624, 625, 7 MSPB 457 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hejka v. Marine Corps</span>, 9 MSPR 137, 140 (1981) (appellant rebutted an allegation of theft by credible evidence of the unorthodox method of purchase of a piece of cheese at a base commissary); <span class="Italic">Henry v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 19, 22-23 (1982) (there was no intent to steal tools when the appellant secured a pass from a supervisor to use the tools for personal reasons). The type of evidence needed is demonstrated by <span class="Italic">Youraine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 500, 503, 3 MSPB 23 (1980). Instead of charging an employee with theft, the agency may allege that the employee wrongfully removed government property. In <span class="Italic">Youraine</span> a preponderance of the evidence supported this charge: the property was found through a search of the employee's home; the seized items were identical to those carried in a government storehouse; identification labels were removed from the items without explanation; a government identification tag on one item was concealed with tape; the appellant had no permission to remove the articles; and the appellant admitted that some items in his house came from his office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The criteria for deciding cases of wrongful removal of property were slightly expanded in <span class="Italic">Bixby v. USDA</span>, 24 MSPR 13, 19 (1984). An electronics technician was required to carry some equipment around with him in his work. He defended the wrongful possession case by arguing that the government property was properly in his possession. The Board found against him: there was no authorization to store government property where it was found (in the appellant's possession off the agency premises). Wrongful intent could be inferred from the long time the appellant had possession of the property, from the quantity of the property, the need for the equipment, the location of the equipment, the circumstances of appellant's removal of property from prior places of employment, and the availability of alternate and suitable storage areas.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harper v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 446, 449-50 (1994), emphasized the distinction in the gravity of the charge of unauthorized possession of property, not requiring intent to steal, and the charge of theft, requiring proof of intent. Another case of wrongful possession of tools was reported in <span class="Italic">Joy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 652, 654-55 (1984), <span class="Italic">overruled by</span> <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 456, 460 (1991), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 54 MSPR 461, 468 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Nothing in the record suggested that management condoned the unauthorized use of equipment and a conclusion could not be drawn that there was a practice of unauthorized use.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee takes an item for use inconsistent with agency rights to the property and there is no immediate intention to return the equipment, unauthorized possession (as well as attempted removal of property) is established. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mertins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 157, 160 (1994) ("[T]he administrative judge specifically found that the appellant had no permission to take the I-beams, and that he did not make any serious inquiries regarding the ownership...because he did not really want to get answers."); <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 675, 679 n.4 (1993) (unauthorized possession charge was established by the admission of the appellant that he removed agency scrap metal from a shipyard bin, cut it to fit his truck, and placed it in his truck, without permission; the Board observed at note 4 of the decision: "Regardless of whether a showing of intent is required to prove an attempted removal, as it is required to prove theft, we find that the appellant's actions here demonstrate the requisite intent to remove the scrap metal."), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("Logically, intent is an important element of proof in an 'attempt' charge, because, if the improper act, e.g., removal, had not yet occurred, it is difficult to determine whether a removal was in fact being undertaken and thus whether an attempt had occurred without making a finding on intent. We therefore conclude that the charge of attempted removal of government property requires proof that Chauvin intended to remove the plate from the shipyard without authorization."), <span class="Italic">following remand from court</span>, <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 590, 593 (1995) (mitigating factors led to a reduction of demotion to a 30-day suspension: the misconduct was isolated, it was committed without malice, the appellant was remorseful, the value of the metal taken was small, and the appellant did not have custody and control over the property as part of his official duties); <span class="Italic">Dobroski v. U.S. Marshals Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 499, 501 (1982) (shoplifting charge: "The inference drawn when one places a bottle of liquor in his pants pocket instead of his shopping cart, covers it with his coat and walks out of the store without making payment is that the act was intentional.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If intent is required as an element of the charge, the appellant may rebut evidence of intent to remove property by showing a good faith belief that the removal was authorized. <span class="Italic">St. Clair v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 634, 637-38 (1993), set aside a suspension based in part on "unauthorized removal of government property, approximately 16 stale donuts":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The focus in this case should not be on whether the appellant received management authorization to remove the donuts; rather, it should be on whether she reasonably, and in good faith, believed that she had received such authorization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a WG-3 Food Service Worker. She evidently has had no prior discipline in her over 20 years of service. In addition, she was specifically told by Ms. Raglin (who, as a Lead Food Worker, was responsible for guiding the appellant in her daily duties) that Mr. Flesse had stated that the employees could help themselves to the donuts. The appellant testified that when she was told by Ms. Raglin that she could take the donuts, she asked whether Ms. Raglin was sure and that Ms. Raglin said that Mr. Flesse had said it was all right. Thus, the appellant took the donuts only after taking steps to ascertain that her supervisor meant to allow the employees to have them. Certainly, under these circumstances, the appellant reasonably, and in good faith, believed she could take the donuts. Therefore, the charge should not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we have not specifically addressed this precise situation before, our case law supports the proposition that an appellant's reasonable and good faith belief that removal of government property had been authorized rebuts the agency's contention that she was specifically informed, on notice, or otherwise should have known that her actions were unauthorized. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Woodard v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 MSPR 492, 495, 496 (1983); <span class="Italic">Combs v. US Postal Service</span>, 5 MSPR 158, 160 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the charge here cannot be sustained. The agency's suspension action must fail.</p>

DOJ</span>, SF-0752-13-0032-I-2 (NP 10/10/2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting on other grounds), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/15-3066.Opinion.2-25-2016.1.PDF">815 F.3d 757</a> (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Judge Taranto dissented in part) (reversed in part on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. DOJ</span>, 874 F.3d 710 (Fed. Cir. 2017)), considered the appellant's intent, negating a charge of theft, in the treatment of property:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain a charge of theft, an agency must prove a taking and <span id="Page_2789"></span>possession of another's property in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights and benefits, with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession or use of his property. <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 456, 460 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 43 F.3d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Intent is a state of mind which is generally proven by circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Messersmith v. General Services Administration</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 150, 157 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency had a possessory interest in the furniture. The victim of a theft does not have to be the owner of the property, only in possession of it. <span class="Italic">See Morissette v. United States</span>, 342 U.S. 246, 271 (1952) (defining stealing to mean the taking away from one in lawful possession without right with the intention to keep wrongfully (citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">Levin v. United States</span>, 338 F.2d 265, 268 (D.C. Cir. 1964) (holding that larceny is the felonious taking and carrying away of anything of value, and that ownership of the property does not matter); <span class="Italic">People v. Edwards</span>, 236 P. 944, 950 (Cal. Ct. App. 1925), <span class="Italic">disapproved on other grounds, In re Estrada</span>, 408 P.2d 948, 953-54 (Cal. 1965) (holding that ownership and possession may be regarded as synonymous terms for larceny); <span class="Italic">People v. Davis</span>, 31 P. 1109, 1109 (Cal. 1893) (holding that the fact that the taken property was in possession of the victim was sufficient to show ownership). Here, the agency had possession of the furniture as it was in the office space that it had leased from the landlord, and the landlord intended the furniture to be used in the space under the terms of the lease. Therefore, the agency did have a legal interest in the furniture and the appellant erred in assuming otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency has not proven that the appellant intended to permanently deprive it of the possession or use of the property. The administrative judge found that the appellant honestly, if mistakenly, believed that all the furniture belonged to the landlord, and the FBI had no interest in it. Ignorance or mistake of law can negate the existence of specific intent, as required in the agency's charge. <span class="Italic">People v. Vineburg</span>, 177 Cal. Rptr. 819 (Cal. Ct. App. 1981). The appellant's belief must be claimed to be held in good faith. We agree with the agency that the appellant's creation of a fake purchase agreement and receipt raises some questions about his good faith belief. However, the appellant testified that his purpose was to assist the landlord in justifying the removal of the furniture and storage in another facility if the agency asked for the furniture back. Because the appellant has shown he had a good faith belief that the agency had no legal interest in the furniture, the agency has not proven that the appellant intended to permanently deprive it of the possession or use of the property. Therefore, the agency has not proven its charge of theft, and we adopt the administrative judge's finding on this issue as the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an appellant reasonably believed that she was permitted to take a piece of government equipment off of agency premises, a charge against her of unauthorized possession could not be sustained. The charge of unauthorized possession does not require proof of the intent required to establish theft. Examining evidence concerning the appellant's intent and the circumstances involving her possession of the property, the Board seemed disinclined to sustain the charge based on what might have been technical errors by the appellant or others in the agency concerning the need for passes or other paperwork to take the agency property off government premises. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Culley v. DLA</span>, 60 MSPR 204, 212 (1993) (charge concerning electric blender).
