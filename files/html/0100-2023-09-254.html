<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-251"><span class="space">c.</span> Medical, Psychiatric Examinations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Fed. R. Civ. P. 35 outlines the process for obtaining a physical or mental examination through discovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Physical and Mental Examinations</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Order for an Examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In General</span>. The court where the action is pending may order a party whose mental or physical condition--including blood group--is in controversy to submit to a physical or mental examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner. The court has the same authority to order a party to produce for examination a person who is in its custody or under its legal control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motion and Notice; Contents of the Order</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;may be made only on motion for good cause and on notice to all parties and the person to be examined; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination, as well as the person or persons who will perform it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Examiner's Report</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Request by the Party or Person Examined</span>. The party who moved for the examination must, on request, deliver to the requester a copy of the examiner's report, together with like reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. The request may be made by the party against whom the examination order was issued or by the person examined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contents</span>. The examiner's report must be in writing and must set out in detail the examiner's findings, including diagnoses, conclusions, and the results of any tests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Request by the Moving Party</span>. After delivering the reports, the party who moved for the examination may request--and is entitled to receive--from the party against whom the examination order was issued like reports of all earlier or later examinations of the same condition. But those reports need not be delivered by the party with custody or control of the person examined if the party shows that it could not obtain them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Waiver of Privilege</span>. By requesting and obtaining the examiner's report, or by deposing the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege it may have--in that action or any other action involving the same controversy--concerning testimony about all examinations of the same condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Failure to Deliver a Report</span>. The court on motion may order--on just terms--that a party deliver the report of an examination. If the report is not provided, the court may exclude the examiner's testimony at trial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Scope</span>. This subdivision (b) applies also to an examination made by the parties' agreement, unless the agreement states otherwise. This subdivision does not preclude obtaining an examiner's report or deposing an examiner under other rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hasler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HASLER_DWIGHT_F_AT_0752_95_1201_P_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199686.pdf">79 MSPR 415</a>, 416-21 (1998), determined that AJs have the authority to order mental examinations of appellants who claim damages for emotional distress. <span class="Italic">Hasler</span> arose under the Whistleblower Protection Act, a statute providing consequential damages. Board Vice Chair Slavet dissented, arguing that consequential damages do not include damages for emotional distress (a result changed by the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amendments of 2012) and, as a result, there was no need to reach the Board's authority to direct mental examinations. The dissenter had the better argument (although later legislation authorized compensatory damages for whistleblowers and mixed cases permit recovery of compensatory damages), but the Board's majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Hasler</span> approved the use of a directed examination and explained the prerequisites for its use as to a claim for damages based on a mental injury or disorder:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency demoted the appellant from his position of Range Security Officer, GM-14, to the position of Security Officer, GS-12, effective August 14, 1995. The appellant appealed the agency's action to the Board. After a hearing, the administrative judge issued a decision reversing the appellant's demotion. <span class="Italic">Hasler v.

In the decision, which became the final decision of the Board on February 28, 1997, the administrative judge found that the agency's action was improperly based on activities of the appellant protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then filed a petition seeking consequential damages under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii). The appellant requested restoration of annual and sick leave used, past and anticipated future medical expenses, travel expenses, interest on money borrowed to pay legal expenses, losses on the sale of his home, performance awards lost, the value of training not received, other unspecified pecuniary losses, and $500,000 for emotional distress. In support of his claim for emotional distress due to severe clinical depression resulting from the agency's action, the appellant has stated his intention to offer expert testimony from clinical psychologists and a physician.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency opposed the appellant's claim for damages for emotional distress as unauthorized by the statute. In addition, the agency sought subpoenas for the appellant's medical records maintained by two of the clinicians treating him, and it filed the motion for a mental examination of the appellant which is the subject of this appeal. The agency asserted that such an evaluation, to be conducted by an examiner licensed or certified in accordance with Rule 35, was necessary in view of the appellant's extraordinary claim for damages for mental distress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge granted the subpoenas requested by the agency. However, he denied its motion to order a Rule 35 mental examination, citing the Board's ruling in <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Department of Transportation</span>, 46 MSPR 666 (1991), that an administrative judge lacks authority to order such an examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency then filed a motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal of the ruling denying its motion, contending that the ruling meets the criteria for such an appeal because it involves an important question of law about which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion and because an immediate ruling would advance the proceeding by permitting the agency to present a full defense. The agency argued...that <span class="Italic">Brumley</span> was wrongly decided....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted in his ruling, the Board determined that it lacks authority to require an appellant to undergo a physical and psychiatric examination in <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Department of Transportation</span>, 46 MSPR 666 (1991), where the agency sought such an order because of a dispute with the appellant regarding the date and degree of his recovery from a compensable injury. The Board held that the administrative judge erred in granting the agency's request. <span class="Italic">Brumley</span> followed an earlier case, <span id="Page_1240"></span><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 285 (1988), which upheld denial of a request to order a nonparty to submit to a mental examination because such an order is not authorized by Fed.R.Civ.P. 35. <span class="Italic">Zimmerman</span> also noted that under <span class="Italic">Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford,</span> 141 U.S. 250, 11 S. Ct. 1000, 35 L. Ed. 734 (1891), federal courts lack inherent authority to order such examinations and stated that courts have such authority only "because Congress remedied this lack by drafting Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure," which does not give authority to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 36 MSPR at 285 n.7. Adopting this analysis of the <span class="Italic">Botsford</span> case, <span class="Italic">Brumley</span> concluded that "the Board lacks authority to order a party to undergo a physical or mental examination absent specific Congressional authorization." 46 MSPR at 680.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Brumley</span> and <span class="Italic">Zimmerman</span> recognized, <span class="Italic">Botsford</span> held that the district court lacked authority to order the plaintiff in a personal injury suit to undergo a physical examination. The Court determined that there was no basis for such authority in common law, that the law of the state in which the district court sat was unclear, and that, in any event, the matter was controlled by a federal statute governing the mode of proof in actions at common law which made no provision for such examinations. 141 U.S. 250, 11 S. Ct. at 1003. However, the Board's decisions mischaracterized the subsequent legislative action leading to the promulgation of Rule 35. In the Enabling Act of 1934, Congress authorized the Supreme Court to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure for the federal courts, provided that the rules prescribed did not modify substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 USC &#x00A7; 2072. Rule 35 was promulgated by the Court pursuant to that authority. We have found no basis for the statement in <span class="Italic">Zimmerman</span> that "Congress drafted Rule 35." Such direct Congressional involvement is not mentioned in the 1937 Advisory Committee Notes concerning the rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> 12 Wright &#x0026; Miller, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span>, Appendix C, pp. 414-15 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Sibbach v. Wilson</span>, 312 U.S. 1, 61 S. Ct. 422, 85 L. Ed. 479 (1941), the Court upheld the validity of Rule 35 in the face of a challenge based on the proviso in the Enabling Act denying the Court authority to prescribe rules which would modify substantive rights. The Court rejected the petitioner's contention that the right to be free from a physical examination during the course of civil litigation was a substantive right within the meaning of the statute. It found that <span class="Italic">Botsford</span> recognized that the matter was one of procedure because it relied on procedural statutes concerning the mode of proof in federal court. 312 U.S. 1, 61 S. Ct. at 425. <span class="Italic">Sibbach</span> concluded that Rule 35 was a procedural rule because it regulated the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties and administering remedies, and the Court rejected the argument that the rule made too major a change of policy to have been intended by Congress in conferring rule making authority on the Court. Rather, it found that Rule 35 served the Congressional policy that court procedures be regulated in the interest of speedy, fair and exact determination of the truth. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 312 U.S. 1, 61 S. Ct. at 426-27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the foregoing, it is clear that the authority of the federal courts to order physical and mental examinations where appropriate is not specifically conferred by a statute but by a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court under its statutory authority to prescribe practice and procedure rules for the federal courts. This fact is significant because the Board has analogous statutory authority to prescribe rules of procedure for its proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(h) ("such regulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions") and 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(k) ("regulations to carry out the purpose of this section"). Pursuant to that authority, the Board has promulgated regulations governing discovery, including 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.72(c) specifying methods of discovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Parties may use one or more of the methods provided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. These methods include written interrogatories, depositions, requests for production of documents or things for inspection or copying, and requests for admission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation, by omitting reference to requests for physical and mental examinations, does not authorize use of the method of discovery set out in Rule 35. However, we find that the Board's statutory authority to prescribe rules of procedure permits the Board to authorize use of Rule 35 examinations in its proceedings, and we overrule the holding of <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Department of Transportation</span> to the contrary. We also find that the availability of such examinations will serve the interests of fairness and of accurate determination of the truth in cases where they are appropriate and therefore declare that this method of discovery is available in the Board's proceedings when the conditions stated in Rule 35 are met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find that the agency's request for a mental examination of the appellant meets those conditions. Under Rule 35 the mental condition of the party to be examined must be "in controversy," and "good cause" for an examination of the party must be shown. The Supreme Court addressed these requirements in <span class="Italic">Schlagenhauf v. Holder,</span> 379 U.S. 104, 85 S. Ct. 234, 13 L. Ed.2d 152 (1964). While stating that the party requesting an examination must show that these requirements are met, the Court added that a plaintiff asserting mental or physical injury in a negligence action "places that mental or physical injury clearly in controversy and provides the defendant with good cause for an examination to determine the existence and extent of such asserted injury." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 379 U.S. 104, 85 S. Ct. at 243.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim for damages for mental distress is not necessarily an assertion of "mental injury" as used by the Court in <span class="Italic">Schlagenhauf</span>. The courts generally find that a party's mental condition has been placed in controversy for purposes of ordering a Rule 35 mental examination if more than common pain and suffering is alleged--for example, where the party seeks a large award of damages for a severe ongoing mental injury or psychiatric disorder and plans to rely on expert testimony to support the claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shepherd v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc</span>., 151 F.R.D. 194, 212 (D.D.C. 1993) ($2 million in compensatory damages sought for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder/Syndrome and psychiatrist's deposition offered to support claim), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part on other grounds</span>, 62 F.3d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Tomlin v. Holecek,</span> 150 F.R.D. 628, 629-30 (D. Minn. 1993) (damages sought for "severe and permanent physical and emotional injuries," and psychologist's expert testimony to be offered in support); <span class="Italic">Anson v. Fickel,</span> 110 F.R.D. 184, 186 (N.D. Ind. 1986) (damages sought for emotional distress due to an accident and, as a result of his injuries, the plaintiff sought psychiatric help and his treatment required confinement in a psychiatric ward).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the appellant is seeking $500,000 in damages for emotional distress, in addition to payments for past and future treatments, for a mental condition diagnosed as "Major Depression, severe-DSM IV 296.23." In seeking a large amount of damages for a severe and ongoing psychiatric disorder alleged to have been caused by the agency's action, the appellant is relying on expert evidence from clinical psychologists and a physician in support of his claim. We find that such claims put the appellant's mental condition "in controversy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that there is "good cause" for a mental examination of the appellant. The agency has clearly shown good cause under cases which read <span class="Italic">Schlagenhauf</span> to find that a claim for damages based on a mental injury or disorder in itself provides good cause for such an examination. <span class="Italic">See Tomlin v. Holecek,</span> 150 F.R.D. at 630. <span class="Italic">Cf. Shepherd v. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc</span>., 151 F.R.D. at 213. It is true that other cases indicate that the party seeking an examination must first have utilized less intrusive discovery procedures, before seeking the examination. <span class="Italic">See Anson v. Fickel,</span> 110 F.R.D. at 186. Without deciding whether the latter rule should be followed, we note that the agency requested subpoenas for the appellant's medical records, a request which was granted by the administrative judge. Although the agency sought an order for a mental examination at the same time, it has now presumably had an opportunity to review the appellant's records. Unless the agency withdraws its motion for a mental examination on remand, we find that there is good cause to grant it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Hasler,</span> the AJ had no authority to order psychological evaluation or to sign an authorization for release of medical information. <span class="Italic">Helman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 164, 168 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DeGraaff v. VA</span>, 73 MSPR 224, 228 (1997) (improper for the AJ to condition the appellant's right to a hearing upon her having a psychiatric examination); <span class="Italic">Loots v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 42 MSPR 571, 579-80 (1989) (suggesting the possibility of a compulsory medical examination if the request was limited to the circumstances directly involved in the appeal); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.
