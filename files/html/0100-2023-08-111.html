<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-110"><span class="space">6.</span> Defective or Untimely Termination Notice</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The probationary employee discharged for unsatisfactory performance or conduct is entitled to a notice stating why he is terminated. The notice should include at least the agency's conclusions concerning the inadequacies of the employee's performance or conduct. 5 CFR 315.804(a) (2022). A probationary employee terminated for conditions arising before appointment is to receive an advance written notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed action, a reasonable time to file a written answer to the notice and to support the answer through affidavits, and consideration of the answer by the agency prior to the issuance of a final decision that the employee is entitled to receive at or before the effective date of the removal action. 5 CFR 315.805 (2022). The probationary supervisor gets a notice of involuntary retreat or return action (unless, perchance, the probationary supervisor is also a probationer under &#x00A7; 315.801; if so, he receives the notice required by that section). 5 CFR 315.907 (2022). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-105.html#sec1-104">Preappointment Conditions</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 315.804 (2022) does not provide that an employee is entitled to the advance written notice of termination of a probationary appointment given to a nonprobationary employee under 5 USC 7513. But the plain meaning of the regulatory language indicates that the employee is not terminated until he receives that notice. It is only "by notifying him in writing" that termination of the employee's services is accomplished. Notification does not have to be received by the employee before the termination if the agency's attempts to give prior notification are diligent and reasonable under the circumstances. Use of certified mail to communicate to an employee a termination effective on the same day that a termination notice is issued is not a reasonable and diligent attempt to ensure prior service; constructive delivery did not occur. The employee was not terminated until after his probationary period expired; the termination was set aside for harmful procedural error: he was not effectively terminated during probation and the termination was without the due process required for a nonprobationary employee, <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 8, 14-16 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The governing regulation with respect to the termination of probationary employees in the competitive service for unsatisfactory performance or conduct occurring after their appointment, provides that an agency "shall <span id="Page_165"></span>terminate [the employee's] services by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the action." The regulation notes that the reasons for the termination must consist of the agency's conclusions as to the employee's inadequacies in his performance or conduct. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.804 does not provide that the employee is entitled to <span class="Italic">advance</span> written notice as is provided for a nonprobationary employee under Section 7513 of Title 5. Nevertheless, the plain meaning of the regulatory language indicates that the employee is not terminated until he receives such notice since it is only "by notifying him in writing" that termination of the employee's services is accomplished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The courts interpreting this provision have recognized that the rights conferred by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.804 are very narrow. "Procedurally, a probationary employee has the right only to be notified prior to the termination of his employment as to the agency's 'conclusions as to the inadequacies of [the probationer's] performance or conduct.'" <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Shaw v. United States,</span> 622 F.2d 520, 527, 223 Ct. Cl. 532, <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 449 U.S. 881, 101 S. Ct. 231, 66 L. Ed.2d 105 (1980), citing <span class="Italic">Perlongo v. United States,</span> 215 Ct. Cl. 982, 566 F.2d 1192 (1977), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 436 U.S. 944, 98 S. Ct. 2844, 56 L. Ed.2d 785 (1978), and <span class="Italic">Horne v. United States,</span> 190 Ct. Cl. 145, 148, 419 F.2d 416, 418 (1969). Although failure to provide such notification prior to termination has been held to constitute substantial noncompliance with the regulation where the employee did not receive the agency reasons until six months after her discharge <span class="Italic">(see</span> <span class="Italic">Watson v. United States,</span> 162 F. Supp. 755, 758-759, 142 Ct.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shaw, supra</span>, at 527-9, the court rejected the employee's argument that he had completed his probationary period because he did not receive the termination notice until after the expiration of the probationary period. There, shortly after the employee was verbally told that he was going to be terminated during his probationary period, he was admitted to a hospital. Despite the agency's attempts to serve the notice by sending several copies to his home, one of which was personally delivered by an agency employee, as well as sending a telegram with the contents of the notice to the hospital, the employee "curiously enough," did not receive the notice until his discharge from the hospital. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 528. The court therefore held that the agency efforts to serve the termination notice on the employee "were all that could be reasonably expected under the circumstances," and that "constructive delivery" of the termination notice was accomplished before the effective date of the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> the evidence in these cases does not support a finding that the agency made reasonable and diligent attempts to serve the termination notices on Pierron and Janaes prior to the effective date of the termination actions. Since the agency action as to appellant Pierron was to become effective the same day that the August 6 termination notice was issued, the agency's selection of the mode of service, i.e., "certified mail, restricted delivery" was completely inadequate to ensure prior service. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, as noted above, an employee will be deemed to have received constructive notice of his termination if the agency made diligent and reasonable attempts under the circumstances to effect service of the notice prior to the effective date of the action. <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. at 15-16. Here, the administrative judge found that the agency's efforts to effect prior service on the appellant were insufficient. In so finding, she noted that the agency mailed the termination notice to the appellant's residence in Michigan via first-class mail and certified mail on Friday, August 23, 2013, but did not attempt to send the letter by Federal Express to ensure delivery before the end of his probationary period. She further noted that the appellant's agency-issued cell phone was not disconnected until August 27, 2013, but that the agency did not attempt to text him to inform him that he was being terminated.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> In addition, the administrative judge noted that the agency could have called or texted the appellant on his agency-issued cell phone or tried to contact the 10 local hospitals to determine his location to serve him with the termination letter in person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that it did not make a reasonable and diligent effort to inform the appellant of his termination in writing prior to the end of his probationary period when, on August 24, 2013, the Chief Deputy and the appellant's first-level supervisor attempted to personally deliver the termination notice to him at his duty station. The agency further argues that the administrative judge failed to consider relevant case law that supports a finding that the appellant received constructive notice in this case. For the reasons that follow, we find that these arguments provide no basis to disturb the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the first case cited by the agency, the U.S. Court of Claims found that the agency constructively notified a probationary employee of his January 2, 1972, termination when, after he unexpectedly did not report to work on December 30, 1971, it sent copies of the notice to his home address by mail and messenger and, upon learning the next day that he was in the hospital, sent a telegram with the contents of the notice to the hospital, which the employee's wife refused to accept. <span class="Italic">Shaw v. United States</span>, 622 F.2d 520, 523, 528 (Cl. Ct. 1980). The court also found probative the fact that the employee was verbally notified of his "imminent termination" on December 29, 1971, and that "[h]e had every reason to expect a notice would soon be delivered to him, yet curiously enough, he received none of the many notices sent until the day after his discharge from the hospital." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 528.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the second case cited by the agency, the Board found that the agency constructively notified a probationary employee of her termination when, while she was out on sick leave, it sent a messenger to personally serve her with the termination notice and, upon finding that she was not home, the messenger taped the termination notice on her door. <span class="Italic">Cephas v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 69, 72, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 785 F.2d 321 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). The Board explained that sending a messenger to personally deliver the notice to the employee's home when her whereabouts were unknown was indicative of due diligence by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> and <span class="Italic">Cephas</span> are distinguishable from the instant case.[4] As noted above, the agency mailed the termination notice to the appellant's residence in Michigan by certified and first-class mail on Friday, August 23, 2013--the purported effective date of the termination. On the morning of Saturday, August 24, 2013--the day <span class="Italic">after</span> the stated effective date of the termination--the Deputy Chief and the appellant's first-level supervisor attempted to deliver the termination notice to him at his duty station but were unable to do so because he did not report to work that morning. HCD (testimony of the Deputy Chief). According to the Deputy Chief, once they realized the appellant was not going to report to work that day, the appellant's first-level supervisor attempted to call him at his home and on his cell phone but was unable to reach him or to determine to which hospital he had been admitted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Deputy Chief also testified that the agency took no further steps to effect timely service of the written termination notice on the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The third case, cited by the agency as <span class="Italic">Bartholomew v. United States</span>, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17367 (N.D. Ill. 1983), appears to be an unpublished Federal district court case. The agency did not provide a copy of this decision, and we are unable to locate it. In any event, we need not consider Bartholomew because district court decisions are not binding on the Board, and unpublished opinions are of no precedential value. <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 76, 79 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the agencies involved in both the <span class="Italic">Cephas</span> and <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> cases, the agency here did not attempt to use a messenger or any delivery service that was reasonably likely to deliver notice to the appellant's home address before the effective date of the action or before the end of his probationary period. Rather, as noted above, the agency sent the termination notice to the appellant's residence in Michigan by first-class and certified mail on the effective date of the action, Friday, August 23, 2013. The Board has specifically held that mailing a termination notice to an employee by certified mail on the effective date of the action <span id="Page_166"></span>was "completely inadequate to ensure prior service." <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. at 15. Unsurprisingly, the termination notice was not delivered to the appellant's out-of-state residence on the same day it was mailed, and a tracking report submitted by the agency reflects that the Postal Service first attempted to deliver the certified letter on August 27, 2013. Thus, even if the appellant had been at his residence, rather than in the hospital, he would not have received the mailed termination notice before its effective date on August 23, 2013, or before the end of his probationary period on August 25, 2013.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the agency in <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, the agency here did not make reasonable efforts to effect timely service on the appellant in the hospital upon learning that he would not be reporting to work. Although the agency contends that it did not know to which hospital the appellant had been admitted, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency failed to make reasonable efforts to determine that information by, for example, calling or texting the appellant on his agency-issued cell phone, which he had been using to text his supervisor, or by trying to contact the local hospitals to find out if the appellant had been admitted there. In addition, unlike the employee in <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> who did not request leave or notify his employing agency that he was being admitted to the hospital, the appellant here notified his first-level supervisor on Thursday, August 22, 2013, that he had to go to the emergency room and sent text messages to him on Saturday, August 24 and Sunday, August 25, 2013, stating that he would be getting a heart catheterization on the following Monday.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, unlike the employee in <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> the appellant here had no reason to expect that his termination was imminent because, as discussed above, he did not receive verbal notice of his termination prior to the end of his probationary period. Moreover, the record reflects that on August 20, 2013, the agency authorized his travel to retake the C-Well certification examination on August 29, 2013.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing, we find that the agency failed to take diligent and reasonable efforts under the circumstances to constitute timely constructive notice. Accordingly, we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's determination that the agency failed to effect the appellant's termination before the end of his probationary period, and we agree that the appellant's termination must be reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ineffective efforts to serve by agency email and certified mail a termination notice on a probationer who was on leave resulted in reversal of the termination in <span class="Italic">Allen v. DHHS</span>, DE-315H-18-0006-I-1 (NP 5/11/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, it is undisputed that the agency's termination action is based upon conduct occurring after the appellant's appointment, the agency must notify him "in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the action." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804(a). The plain meaning of the regulatory language indicates that the employee is not terminated until he receives such notice because the regulations state that the agency terminates the employee "by notifying him in writing." <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1983) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672 (1991). An agency is not required to actually afford an employee prior notice of its intention to terminate him, so long as it acts diligently and reasonably under the circumstances in attempting to afford him prior notice. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2011); <span class="Italic">Santillan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 21, 26 (1992). As discussed below, we find that the agency did not act in a diligent or reasonable way when, during the appellant's absence, it mailed him notice of his termination on its effective date and sent him an email to his agency address when he was on leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency sent the appellant notice of his termination by certified mail on Friday, September 1, 2017, the last day of his tour of duty. However, he did not receive this notice until September 5, 2017, after his September 4, 2017 anniversary date. The Board has held, under similar circumstances, that such service, on its own, does not afford the appellant proper notice of the agency's termination action. <span class="Italic">See Lavelle</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. at 16 (finding that, because the agency's termination action was to become effective the same day that it was issued, the agency's selection of "certified mail, restricted delivery," was inadequate to ensure prior service). Here, we also find that the certified mail, without more, did not constitute a diligent and reasonable effort to notify the appellant of his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that sending the email to the appellant's agency address does not cure the deficiency in notifying him. In responding to the show cause order, the appellant stated that he was unable to access this email and that, if he were able to do so, he never received training regarding how to do so. In making this statement, he indicated on the online questionnaire that he was asserting facts from his personal knowledge and declared, under penalty of perjury, that the facts stated in his pleading were true and correct. A declaration subscribed as true under penalty of perjury, if uncontested, proves the facts it asserts. <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 271, 273 (1986). Here, the agency asserts that its employees can access their Government email via its website. However, it has not contradicted the appellant's assertion that, in the event that he had such access, the agency did not train him on how to use the website to access his email. Furthermore, his former coworkers' statements that they believed a PIV card was required to access email outside of work support the appellant's assertion. Consequently, we find that, even assuming that the appellant could have accessed his agency email outside of work, the agency did not inform him that he could do so or instruct him on the process for accessing it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Accordingly, we find that the agency's email to an account that the appellant did not know he could access does not make its efforts reasonable and diligent. <span class="Italic">Cf. Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2010) (finding that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was not terminated when his Federal Career Internship Program appointment expired when, although he was on leave during the last day of his internship, the agency sent copies of the termination notice to his email and to his residence via overnight and certified mail and his third-line supervisor left voicemail messages on his Government and personal cellular phones informing him that his position was not being converted). Because the agency did not act reasonably and diligently to notify the appellant of his termination and failed to terminate him before the end of his probationary period, we find that he is an "employee" with Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The timing of a notice of termination of an individual serving a probationary or trial period was considered in <span class="Italic">Martin v. DOJ</span>, SF-0752-12-0750-I-1 (NP 9/19/2013), remanding for a determination of whether the appellant was required to serve a probationary period, but determining that if one was required, notice to the employee of termination was sufficient when the agency used mail as well as email:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that she is an employee with Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because she did not receive the agency's termination notice until August 15, 2012, 2 years and 1 day after her appointment. She states that the agency only sent the letter advising her that her appointment would end effective August 11, 2012, to her personal email, which did not constitute a reasonable and diligent effort to notify her of the effective date of her termination because she had been out of the office for medical reasons since July 6, 2012. Thus, she argues, she remained an employee until she opened the email on August 15, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the agency acted reasonably and diligently in notifying the appellant of her termination and that the appellant was therefore terminated effective August 11, 2012, before completing 2 years of service.[2] The appellant cites <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. 8, 14-16 (1983), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672 (1991), where the Board found that sending a termination notice by certified mail on the effective date of the action was completely inadequate to ensure prior service.[3] However, <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> is not analogous to the situation here. An agency is not required to actually afford an employee prior notice of its intention to terminate her, so long as it acts diligently and reasonably under the circumstances in attempting to afford her prior notice. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2011). The agency in <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> could not have reasonably expected that the employee would receive the termination notice by mail on the same day it was sent by mail, which was the effective date of the action. Here, to the contrary, the appellant communicated with her supervisor on several occasions via her personal email account while she was out of the office on sick leave. Significantly, on August 6, 2012, the appellant sent an email to her supervisor stating that she would "be awaiting" an email from him regarding her leave status. The appellant's supervisor sent the leave information to the appellant via email on August 9, 2012, shortly after sending her the termination notice via email on that same date. Thus, we find that it was reasonable for the appellant's supervisor to expect that she would timely receive the August 9, 2012 termination notice before her appointment ended on August 11, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant argues that the agency should not be "permitted to cut her employment short at the last minute by a period of four days for the sole purpose of evading Board jurisdiction." We find this argument to be without merit. There is no legal authority prohibiting an agency from terminating an employee simply because she is close to completing 2 years of current, continuous service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nelson</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4, 13 (the appellant did not meet the definition of an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because she was terminated less than 1 week before she completed 2 years of current, continuous service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant states that mail is a more acceptable method of serving a termination notice because, although "[t]here is a cultural expectation that people collect and read their mail," there is not yet a similar "cultural expectation...that people will look at their emails in a timely fashion" and "fewer people regularly utilize email at home than open their mail." The appellant provides no citations <span id="Page_167"></span>whatsoever to support these alleged statistics and her purported cultural analysis. Moreover, as previously stated, the appellant regularly communicated by email with her supervisor while on leave and clearly expected further email communications from him. Thus, we see no reason why the agency should have concluded that she was more likely to open her mail than to check her email.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rosenbach v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 37, 38 (1981), decided that a probationary termination notice that fails to advise the employee of Board appeal rights does not establish Board jurisdiction over the appeal.
