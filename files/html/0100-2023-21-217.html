<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Desjardin v. USPS</span>, 2023 MSPB 6, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-17, 19 (2023), explained return rights of employees who are partially recovered from compensable injuries in the federal service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Employees' Compensation Act provides, among other things, that Federal employees who suffer compensable injuries enjoy certain rights to be restored to their previous or comparable positions. <span class="Italic">Kingsley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 9 (2016); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b). Congress has explicitly granted the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) the authority to issue regulations governing the obligations of employing agencies in this regard. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; <span id="Page_4471"></span>8151(b). Pursuant to this authority, OPM has issued regulations requiring agencies to make certain efforts toward restoring employees with compensable injuries to duty, depending on the timing and extent of their recovery. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301; <span class="Italic">see Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 6 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) concerns the restoration rights granted to "partially recovered" employees, defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 as injured employees who, "though not ready to resume the full range" of their regular duties, have "recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements." Section 353.301(d) requires agencies to "make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty." This means, "[a]t a minimum," treating individuals who have partially recovered from a compensable injury substantially the same as other disabled[4] individuals under the Rehabilitation Act, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). The Board has interpreted the regulation to require that an agency must at least search within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which it can restore a partially recovered employee and to consider her for any such vacancies. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 12 (2010).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The regulation anachronistically refers to "handicapped" individuals</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although the Rehabilitation Act may in some cases require an agency to search beyond the local commuting area, we have found that, read as a whole, section 353.301(d) requires only that an agency search within the local commuting area and that the reference to the Rehabilitation Act means that, in doing so, it must undertake substantially the same effort that it would exert under that Act when reassigning a disabled employee within the local commuting area. <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 18</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 does not itself provide for an appeal right to the Board, the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304 provides Board appeal rights <span id="Page_4472"></span>to individuals affected by restoration decisions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301. As relevant here, the regulation provides that a partially recovered individual "may appeal to [the Board] for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). Pursuant to the law and regulations in effect at the time this appeal was filed, to establish jurisdiction over a restoration appeal as a partially recovered individual, the appellant must prove the following by preponderant evidence: (1) he was absent from his position due to a compensable injury; (2) he recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of him; (3) the agency denied his request for restoration; and (4) the denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 659 F.3d 1097, 1104 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 10 (2012), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Cronin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;After <span class="Italic">Bledsoe</span> and <span class="Italic">Latham</span> were issued, the Board changed its regulations and adopted a "nonfrivolous allegation" standard for restoration appeals, rather than the "preponderant evidence" standard set forth in those cases. <span class="Italic">Kingsley</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 10. The new standard applies only in cases filed on or after March 30, 2015, Practices and Procedures, 80 Fed. Reg. 4,489, 4,496 (Jan. 28, 2015) (codified in pertinent part at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57), and is therefore inapplicable to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdictional standard established by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) "reflects the limited substantive right enjoyed by partially recovered employees." <span class="Italic">Bledsoe</span>, 659 F.3d at 1103. Whereas employees who fully recover from a compensable injury within a year have an "unconditional right to restoration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1)," a partially recovered employee does not have such an unconditional right. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe</span>, 659 F.3d at 1103. Rather, the agency only is obliged to "make every effort to restore" a partially recovered employee "in the local commuting area" and "according to the circumstances in each case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). The Board appeal right under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) is likewise conditional: "[b]ecause partially recovered employees do not have an unconditional <span class="Italic">right</span> to restoration, they do not have the right to appeal every <span class="Italic">denial</span> of restoration." <span class="Italic">Bledsoe</span>, 659 F.3d at 1103 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the arbitrary and capricious standard of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) "limits jurisdiction to appeals where the substantive rights of partially recovered [appellants] under section 353.301(d) are actually alleged to have been violated." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">cf. Palmer v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 550 F.3d 1380, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (holding that a partially recovered employee alleging improper restoration "may appeal only on the limited grounds enumerated in [section 353.304(c)]"). In other words, for purposes of the fourth jurisdictional element, a denial of restoration is "rendered arbitrary and capricious by [an agency's] failure to perform its obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d)." <span class="Italic">Bledsoe</span>, 659 F.3d at 1104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the law in effect at the time this appeal was filed, an appellant who established these jurisdictional elements automatically prevailed on the merits. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 10 n.9. In finding that the appellant established jurisdiction over, and thus the merits of, his restoration claim, the administrative judge applied the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, in which the Board held that when an agency voluntarily assumes restoration obligations beyond the "minimum" requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), the agency's failure to comply with those agency-specific requirements is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of establishing Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. As the Board in <span class="Italic">Latham</span> recognized, the U.S. Postal Service's rules obligate it to offer modified assignments when the work is available regardless of whether the duties constitute those of an established position. <span class="Italic">See Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 41. Thus, under existing precedent, the administrative judge properly considered whether the agency properly searched for and provided available duties to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, after the initial decision in this appeal was issued, the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Latham</span> in <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>. The Board in <span class="Italic">Cronin</span> held that, although agencies may undertake restoration efforts beyond the minimum effort required by OPM under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), an agency's failure to comply with self-imposed obligations cannot itself constitute a violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) such that a resulting denial of restoration would be rendered arbitrary and capricious for purposes of establishing Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 20. Rather, as explained in <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, the issue before the Board is limited to whether the agency failed to comply with the minimum requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), i.e., to search within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which it can restore a partially recovered employee and to consider him for any such vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 20 (citing <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 12).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Cronin</span> further held that, contrary to its prior suggestion in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, claims of prohibited discrimination or reprisal cannot serve as an "alternative means" of showing that a denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 21. The Board in <span class="Italic">Cronin</span> held that, although an agency's failure to comply with section 353.301(d) may well be the result of prohibited discrimination or reprisal for protected activity, whether that is so is immaterial to the question of whether a denial of restoration is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of section 353.304(c). <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, the Board's sole jurisdictional inquiry in an appeal alleging an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration to a partially recovered employee is whether the agency complied with its obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) to search within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which it can restore the employee and to consider him for any such vacancies. For restoration rights purposes, the local commuting area is the geographic area in which an individual lives and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to his usual duty station. <span class="Italic">Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). It includes any population center, or two or more neighboring ones, and the surrounding localities. <span class="Italic">Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 189, 193 (1997). The question of what constitutes a local commuting area is one of fact. <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 13. The extent of a commuting area is ordinarily determined by factors such as common practice, the availability and cost of public transportation or the convenience and adequacy of highways, and the travel time required to go to and from work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as in this case, the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious for lack of a proper job search, the Board has found that the proper remedy is for the agency to conduct an appropriate search of the local commuting area retroactive to the date of the appellant's request for restoration, and to consider him for any suitable vacancies. <span class="Italic">Tram v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 10 (2012). The remedy of a retroactive job search will be sufficient to correct the wrongful action and substitute it with a correct one based on an appropriate search. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, it will not put the appellant in a better position than the one he was in before the wrongful action because it leaves open the possibility that the agency still might be unable to find a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant may be entitled to back pay only if the agency's retroactive search uncovers a position to which it could have restored him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We therefore vacate the administrative judge's order requiring the agency to pay the appellant back pay for the period during which she determined he was entitled to partial restoration.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Cronin</span> declined to address how it should address claims of discrimination and retaliation in restoration appeals within its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cronin</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6; 21 n.12. In <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, the Board stated that, in restoration appeals, claims of discrimination and reprisal should be understood as "independent claims" rather than as "affirmative defenses." <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27. The Board indicated that the concept of an "affirmative defense" fits better in matters such as adverse action appeals when the agency bears the burden of proof on the merits.[11] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The Board in <span class="Italic">Latham</span> also noted the possibility that discrimination and reprisal claims could serve as alternative ways for an appellant to show that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27. However, as we explained previously, that aspect of Latham is no longer good law under <span class="Italic">Cronin. Supra</span> &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the Board's criticism in <span class="Italic">Latham</span> of the use of the term "affirmative defense" to describe the adjudication of discrimination and retaliation claims in restoration appeals, the Board has continued to adjudicate those claims in the same manner as it did before <span class="Italic">Latham</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davis v.

Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), if an employee "has been affected by an action which [he] may appeal" to the Board and "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by" certain enumerated anti-discrimination statutes, the Board is required to "decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures." Thus, once the appellant has established that the challenged action is within the Board's jurisdiction, the Board is required by statute to adjudicate both the action itself and any claim that the action was based on one of the enumerated categories of prohibited discrimination.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Federal employees who suffer compensable injuries enjoy certain rights to be restored to their previous or comparable positions. <span class="Italic">Kingsley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) concerns the restoration rights granted to "partially recovered" employees, defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 as injured employees who, "though not ready to resume the full range" of their regular duties, have "recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements." Section 353.301(d) requires agencies to "make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty."

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 does not itself provide for an appeal right to the Board, the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304 provides Board appeal rights to individuals affected by restoration decisions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301.

For example, in the context of an alleged constructive demotion, the Board has found that a conclusory allegation that an appellant was entitled to promotion to her upgraded position was <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> in the absence of supportive facts or legal argument. <span class="Italic">Fleming v. Department of Labor</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2004). For claims of marital status or partisan political discrimination in a termination during a probationary or trial period case, the Board has indicated that allegations must be more than conjecture and that an appellant must provide supporting facts to show the allegations are not merely <span class="Italic">pro forma</span>. <span class="Italic">Smirne v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 51, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). Similarly, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that an allegation of marital status discrimination must be supported by factual assertions and that merely conclusory pleadings are insufficient. <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Finally, in the context of whistleblowing, the Board has found that an appellant must make specific and detailed allegations; vague, conclusory, unsupported, and <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations of alleged wrongdoing do not meet the nonfrivolous pleading standard. <span class="Italic">El v. Department of Commerce</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 76, &#x00B6; 6 (2015); <span class="Italic">Linder v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 14 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the Board's regulatory definition of a nonfrivolous allegation and Board precedent in other contexts, we clarify the distinction between nonfrivolous and <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations for restoration cases: To present nonfrivolous allegations and satisfy the jurisdictional burden in a restoration appeal, an appellant must present material and plausible assertions of fact that, if true, could establish that the agency breached its substantive restoration obligations, including any restoration obligations that it voluntarily adopted. A vague, conclusory, or unsupported allegation, such as one that essentially repeats the legal standard, without more, is <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> and insufficient.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Joves v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-12-0654-B-1 (NP 2/13/2015), summarized the elements of an appeal and burden of proof for the partially recovered employee's restoration rights appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c), an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that: (1) she was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her; (3) the agency denied her request for restoration; and (4) the agency's denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 659 F.3d 1097, 1104 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 10 (2012). If the appellant was not in duty status during the relevant time period, the Board requires her to show as part of the third jurisdictional element that she affirmatively requested restoration. <span class="Italic">See Delalat v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 448, &#x00B6; 17 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In greater detail, <span class="Italic">Walley v. VA</span>, 87 MSPR 236, 240-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2000), explained as to partially recovered employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A partially recovered employee is one who has recovered sufficiently to return to less physically demanding work. <span class="Italic">Leach v. Department of Commerce</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1994). Agencies are required to "make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). Where an individual is entitled to seek and does seek restoration as a partially recovered employee, the agency is continuously obligated to make restoration efforts, to include searching throughout the agency but within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which he could be restored and to consider him for such vacancies. <span class="Italic">Leach</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 15-16, 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who has been separated from his position during his probationary period, and who is partially recovered from a compensable injury, may appeal to the Board "for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). The appellant contends that, because prior to her termination the agency offered her accommodations that OWCP had not determined suitable for her particular disability, it acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying her restoration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). The Board has held that where the agency offered an employee accommodations that OWCP determined suitable for her particular disability, it is precluded from reaching the only conclusion that would entitle the appellant to relief, namely, that the agency's restoration offer was so unreasonable that it amounted to an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">Trembly v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). We find, however, that where the agency has offered an employee accommodations that OWCP has not determined suitable for her particular disability, such does not relieve the appellant's burden to establish that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously. <span class="Italic">New v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 9 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal, the appellant must show that: (1) she is partially recovered from the injury; (2) she requested restoration within certain limitations; (3) the agency denied that request; and (4) she was separated from her position due to a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Chism v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 436, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). The Board can adjudicate the appellant's appeal of her denial of restoration rights if she can establish the above jurisdictional elements. <span class="Italic">Roche v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 828 F.2d 1555, 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Absent proof by preponderant evidence of the above jurisdictional elements, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's termination. The appellant has not alleged that her termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status, or that her termination was based on pre-appointment reasons. <span class="Italic">See generally Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 535 (1998) (the Board has jurisdiction over a probationary employee's termination only if the employee makes a nonfrivolous allegation that his termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status or that his termination was based on pre-appointment reasons and was not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Morman v. DOD</span>, 84 MSPR 96, 101-02 &#x00B6; 8-9 (1999), defined partial recovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The regulations provide that "<span class="Italic">Partially recovered</span> means an injured employee, though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. The doctor's note that the appellant submitted to the agency essentially stated that the appellant could return to her regular duties if the agency placed her in a non-hostile work environment away from her former supervisors and permitted her to use the bathroom at any time due to gastrointestinal problems. The agency asserted that it could not accommodate the appellant's medical condition because "a sales store checker cannot leave the check stand in the middle of checking out a customer." The parties may dispute whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency in a particular situation. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Brocks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 101, 108 (1997). However, to the extent that the administrative judge found the agency's assertion dispositive, he erred. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994) (in determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions;however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if such an accommodation would constitute an undue hardship for the agency, the fact that the agency might be incapable of reasonably accommodating the appellant in her former position would not necessarily mean that the agency did not arbitrarily and capriciously deny the appellant restoration to a position with less demanding physical requirements. In fact, the allegation that the appellant could perform the duties of her former position with accommodation suggests that she is also capable of performing the duties of another position with less demanding physical requirements. Therefore, although the appellant may have improperly labeled the extent of her recovery as "full," we find that the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation that she partially recovered from a compensable injury. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Leach v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 61 MSPR 8, 15-16 (1994), explained the restoration rights of employees who partially recover, distinguishing physically disqualified employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 353.304 of 5 C.F.R. provides that "[a]gencies must make every effort to restore, according to the circumstances in each case, an employee or former employee who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty." The FPM, <span id="Page_4475"></span>ch. 353, subch. 2-2.e (Feb. 24, 1988) defines "partially recovered" to mean that the employee has recovered sufficiently to return to less physically demanding work. We find no basis for disagreeing with this definition and, thus, find it appropriate to defer to it here. <span class="Italic">See Heinze,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. at 377-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed, and we find, that the appellant was a "partially recovered" individual since December 1989, when she sufficiently recovered from her back surgery to return to less physically demanding work. Thus, the agency was obligated to "make every effort to restore" her under, section 353.304. The Board will review an agency's actions with respect to section 353.304 only to determine whether the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's finding that the agency's obligation under section 353.304, just as its obligation under section 353.302, was limited to 1 year from the date compensation began, neither section 353.304 nor any other provision in part 353 of 5 C.F.R. temporarily limits the agency's obligation to restore under section 353.304. <span class="Italic">See generally Farrell,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. at 509-10 (construing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.306 (1986), which was redesignated as section 353.304 in 1988). We therefore find that if the agency cannot restore a physically disqualified individual under section 353.302 or the 1-year period covered by section 353.302 has elapsed, and the individual is entitled to seek and does seek restoration as a partially recovered employee, the agency is obligated to make restoration efforts under section 353.304. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> FPM ch. 353, subch. 2-2.f (Feb. 24, 1988) (providing that "if a physically disqualified employee cannot be placed in an equivalent position, he or she is entitled to the restoration rights provided for partially [re]covered employees"); <span class="Italic">id.,</span> subch. 2-4.c (June 21, 1988) (providing that "[a]fter 1 year, the [physically disqualified] individual is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 (providing that "an employee is...obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment...as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested limited duty in December 1989, after recovering from her August 1989 back surgery, but the agency denied the request, citing its "A-76 cost savings program" that precluded limited duty for custodial workers unless the worker is expected to fully recover within a short period of time. The agency explained that the A-76 cost savings program stemmed from a Presidential Order to ensure that the government was not performing certain tasks that directly competed with private industry. As a result of this program, the agency could not increase its custodial staff, and thus required each of the custodial staff to perform his or her duties fully. We find, under these circumstances, that the agency did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to restore the appellant to limited duty in late 1989 or early 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that, after this denial of limited duty by the agency, the appellant has timely, diligently, and continuously sought restoration to a full-time position. Therefore, the agency had a continuing obligation to "make every effort to restore [her], according to the circumstances in [her] case," under section 353.304. The agency's obligation under section 353.304 included searching throughout the Department of Commerce but within the local commuting area for appropriate full-time clerical vacancies for which the appellant was qualified, and considering her for such vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Farrell,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. at 509, 512-13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's jurisdiction over restoration rights of employees who partially recover from an occupational injury is not as clear as one might hope. The Board will review a claim that the agency failed to provide restoration rights at all, but not that the restoration, once undertaken, was improper--with the exception that a restoration might be so arbitrary, i.e., unsuitable, to place the case into the Board's jurisdiction as a failure to provide restoration rights. The Board described the rights of partially recovered employees in <span class="Italic">Allen v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 73, 76-77 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Partially recovered employees are those who, although not ready to resume the full range of their duties, have recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light-duty, or to positions with less demanding physical requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">Leach v. Department of Commerce</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1994). Agencies are required to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">make every effort to restore...according to the circumstances of each case, an employee or former employee who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. A partially recovered employee may appeal to the Board for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily or capriciously in denying restoration. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 479, 482 (1996); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 137, 140 (1995).

We note that the agency's determination that the appellant would "no longer be scheduled for duty," pending notification by OWCP, could constitute a placement on a leave of absence for purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. Part 353.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For partially recovered employees, <span class="Italic">Maiorana v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 665, 668 (1988), reiterated the somewhat opaque nature of Board jurisdiction:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The right of appeal to the Board for <span class="Italic">all</span> partially recovered employees is limited to claims that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying them restoration. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.306 and 353.401(a)(3) (regulations regarding restoration which do not differentiate between those employees who partially recover within one year of the date compensation began, and those who partially recover more than one year thereafter). Thus, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Carter v. United States Postal Service</span>, 27 MSPR 252, 254 (1985), may be read to suggest that the Board may have jurisdiction over claims of improper restoration by employees who partially recover from compensable injuries <span class="Italic">within one year</span> of the date that compensation began, the case is hereby clarified.</p>

The Board has no jurisdiction over an appeal from an offer of restoration where, as here, an employee contends that she is not sufficiently recovered to perform the duties of the position offered.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lengthier explanations of Board jurisdiction in partial recovery cases are found in the discussion that follows.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's doctor's opinion that she has reached "maximum medical improvement" and has a 25% "permanent partial disability" appears to take her outside the definition of a "partially recovered" employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 ("Ordinarily, it is expected that a partially recovered employee will fully recover eventually.").

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. MSPB</span>, 659 F.3d 1097, 1102-04 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (Judge Newman dissenting), described the Board's jurisdiction to consider the appeals of partially recovered employees who assert that they were improperly denied restoration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3, entitled "appellate jurisdiction," states, in relevant part, that the "Board has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions when the appeals are authorized by law, rule, or regulation...[including f]ailure to restore...following partial or full recovery from a compensable injury (5 C.F.R. 353.304)." Thus, the Board's jurisdiction over appeals from certain denials of restoration is established by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304, which provides (emphasis added):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section</span>, an injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch (including the U.S. Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission) <span class="Italic">may appeal to the MSPB an agency's failure to restore</span>, improper restoration, or failure to return an employee <span class="Italic">following a leave of absence</span>. All appeals must be submitted in accordance with MSPB's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;An individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration</span>. Upon reemployment, a partially recovered employee may also appeal the <span id="Page_4476"></span>agency's failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based on length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, subsection (c) limits the otherwise broad jurisdiction established by subsection (a) in the case of an employee who is only partially recovered from a compensable injury. The Board has held that in order to establish jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c), a petitioner must prove that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;[s]he was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her; (3) the agency denied her request for restoration; and (4) the denial was arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 527, 533 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basis for jurisdiction established by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) reflects the limited substantive right enjoyed by partially recovered employees. Employees who recover fully within a year have the unconditional right to restoration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Gallo v. United States</span>, 529 F.3d 1345, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (explaining that section 8151 "provides <span class="Italic">an absolute right</span> to an employee who is injured and who recovers within one year...[to] return to his old job or an equivalent position." (emphasis added) (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-1081, as reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5341, 5352)). By contrast, partially recovered employees only enjoy a right to have the agency make "every effort to restore" them "in the local commuting area" and "according to the circumstances in each case." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). In other words, partially recovered employees do not have an absolute or unconditional right to restoration; and a partially recovered petitioner alleging nothing more than that she has been denied restoration, has not invoked a legally protected interest before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because partially recovered employees do not have an unconditional <span class="Italic">right</span> to restoration, they do not have the right to appeal every <span class="Italic">denial</span> of restoration. The "arbitrarily and capriciously" requirement of section 353.304(c) limits jurisdiction to appeals where the substantive rights of partially recovered petitioners under section 353.301(d) are actually alleged to have been violated. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 550 F.3d 1380, 1383-4 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("The word 'except,' as used in section 353.304(a), simply alludes to the fact that not all employees to whom sections 353.304(b) and 353.304(c) apply have restoration rights in all circumstances..." and "the Board has jurisdiction over a restoration appeal by an employee who has partially recovered from an injury <span class="Italic">only in the situations enumerated</span> in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c)."); <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 345, 350 (2010) (finding jurisdiction because "[e]vidence that the agency failed to search the commuting area as required by 5 C.F.R. 353.301(d) constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it might seem natural, at first blush, to view subsection 353.304(c)'s inclusion of the term "arbitrarily and capriciously" to be nothing more than a "standard of review," rather than a jurisdictional requirement, to do so would be to ignore the text of sections 353.301(d) and 353.304(a) and (c) and would foist jurisdiction upon the Board over appeals brought by partially recovered petitioners who do not even <span class="Italic">allege</span> that they did not receive the requisite "effort to restore." The Board would then have jurisdiction to decide the merits of a right-to-restoration claim that does not actually exist. Not even the Article III jurisdiction cases, cited above, support such a result. <span class="Italic">Cf. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick</span>, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 1247 (2010) (holding, in Article III context, that copyright "registration requirement...imposes a precondition to filing a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional, is not located in a jurisdiction-granting provision, and admits of congressionally authorized exceptions...[and] thus imposes a type of precondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment."); <span class="Italic">Arbaugh</span>, 546 U.S. at 515 (also in Article III context, holding statutory element that "appears in a separate [statutory] provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts" to be non-jurisdictional).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that to establish jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) the petitioner must prove by preponderant evidence: (1) absence due to a compensable injury; (2) sufficient recovery from the injury to return to duty on a part time basis or in a less physically demanding position; (3) agency denial of a request for restoration; and (4) denial of restoration rendered arbitrary and capricious by agency failure to perform its obligations under 5 C.F.R. 353.301(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, DA-0353-15-0517-I-1 n.2 (NP 5/17/2016) ("Consistent with the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 659 F.3d 1097, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2011), the administrative judge informed the appellant that, to prove jurisdiction over his appeal, he would need to first make nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction, and then he would be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which he would be required to prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence. However, the Board's revised regulation, effective March 30, 2015, and applicable in any appeal filed on or after March 30, 2015, modified the burden of proof for establishing jurisdiction over restoration appeals to require only nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57(b).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Urena v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 6, 8-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11, 2009 MSPB 228 (2009), provided the components of jurisdiction over an appeal from alleged denial of restoration rights of a partially recovered employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Employees Compensation Act and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) implementing regulations provide that federal employees who experience on-the-job compensable injuries have certain rights to be restored to employment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151; <span class="Italic">Tat v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 9 (2008); 5 C.F.R. part 353. Employees of the U.S. Postal Service are among those with rights to restoration. <span class="Italic">See Chen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 12 (2004); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. The nature of an employee's restoration rights depends on the extent and timing of recovery from a compensable injury. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151; <span class="Italic">Delalat v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 448, &#x00B6; 15 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301 (setting forth restoration rights for those who are fully recovered within or after 1 year, who are physically disqualified, or who are partially recovered).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations define a physically disqualified employee in pertinent part as someone who, for medical reasons, is unable to perform the duties of the position formerly held or an equivalent one, and whose condition is considered permanent with little likelihood for improvement or recovery. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">see Kravitz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 483, &#x00B6; 4 (2007). A physically disqualified employee has agencywide rights to placement in a position of the same status and pay for 1 year from the time eligibility for injury compensation begins. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c). After 1 year, the employee's restoration rights are equivalent to those of someone who is fully or partially recovered, as applicable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A partially recovered employee is one who cannot resume the full range of regular duties but has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. OPM's regulations provide the following restoration rights to a partially recovered employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">See Delalat,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 448, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Department of Justice,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 15 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board appeal rights in restoration cases derive from OPM's regulations. <span class="Italic">Foley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 10 (2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. The regulations provide that a partially recovered employee may appeal to the Board only for a determination of whether the agency is acting in an "arbitrary and capricious" way in denying restoration. <span class="Italic">Zysk v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 6 (2008); <span class="Italic">Delalat,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 448, &#x00B6; 17; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). An individual who has been restored to duty may not challenge the details or circumstances of the restoration. <span class="Italic">Foley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 6 (2001). The Board has held, however, that an agency's rescission of a previously provided restoration may be an appealable denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">Brehmer v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 9 (2007); <span class="Italic">see Foley,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 6 (under appropriate circumstances, a restoration may be so unreasonable as to be deemed a denial of restoration, as when a person is unable to perform the duties of the job to which he is restored).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration claim as a partially recovered employee, the appellant must make nonfrivolous allegations that the agency violated her restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 12. To do so, she must allege facts that would show, if proven, that: (1) She was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her; (3) the agency denied her request for restoration; and (4) the denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 5 (2008); <span class="Italic">Gilbert,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ correctly held that the appellant met prongs (1)-(3) above. Whether there is Board jurisdiction turns on whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's action was arbitrary and capricious. We find that she did so. The AJ held that the appellant failed to provide any facts in support of her assertion that the agency did not conduct a search for restoration for her within the local commuting area. Facts without support do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations. <span class="Italic">See Riojas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 3 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). In this case, however, the agency's own evidence corroborates the appellant's assertion. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. United States Postal Service,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994) (in determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation, an AJ may consider the agency's documentary submissions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4477"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowers v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-15-0597-I-1 (NP 7/22/2016) ("While an employee who has been restored to duty after partial recovery may appeal a denial of restoration for a determination of whether it is arbitrary or capricious, he cannot appeal the details or circumstances of the restoration. <span class="Italic">Booker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 982 F.2d 517, 519 (Fed. Cir. 1992).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Explaining Board jurisdiction in more detail, and also discussing the possibility of independent jurisdiction over a restoration that constitutes a reduction in grade, <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 373, 376-79 (1997), stated as to restoration rights on partial recovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who was separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation as a result of a compensable injury (i.e., an injury that entitles the individual to benefits from the Employees' Compensation Fund) may have restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353. <span class="Italic">See Mendenhall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 430, 436 (1997). An employee who has partially recovered from a compensable injury, however, may appeal to the Board only for a determination of whether the agency has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration; he has no right to appeal an alleged improper restoration. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 245, 248 (1993), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 22 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). As he did below, the appellant contends that he was improperly restored because the agency failed to assign him to a position with the grade and salary benefits that he had previously had. He also complains that the duties he performs in his Supervisor, Customer Services position are low-level clerical duties outside his "normal functional area," and he asserts that those duties are not within his physician's restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A partial restoration may under appropriate circumstances be deemed so unreasonable as to amount to a denial of restoration within the Board's jurisdiction; in order to make a nonfrivolous showing of Board jurisdiction over an appeal on that basis, however, an appellant must present specific, independent evidence corroborating his allegations. <span class="Italic">See Scott</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 248-49. The record does not contain such evidence supporting the appellant's claim that his partial restoration violated his medical restrictions, and that claim thus does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 249. Similarly, his argument that the agency should have restored him to a position with the same grade and pay benefits as his previous position, and with duties that were more commensurate with his previous functional skills, likewise does not demonstrate Board jurisdiction over this appeal. Unlike a fully recovered individual, one who has partially recovered from a compensable injury has no right to mandatory restoration to his former position or an "equivalent" one with like seniority, status, and pay. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of Justice</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 92, 97, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 43 F.3d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Beard v. Department of Defense</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 355, 358 (1993). Since the agency has accomplished the appellant's restoration to duty as a partially recovered individual, the Board lacks jurisdiction to address his complaints about the particular details and circumstances of his restoration; the administrative judge thus correctly dismissed his restoration-rights claim. <span class="Italic">See Booker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 982 F.2d 517, 518-19 (Fed. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 114 S. Ct. 178 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, Board jurisdiction over such a claim may not be asserted unless the individual was furloughed or separated as a result of a compensable injury, <span class="Italic">see Mendenhall</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 436, but the record here does not specifically show whether or not the appellant was furloughed or separated. The administrative judge did not address this question, apparently because she dismissed his restoration-rights claim on another basis. As discussed below, however, the issue of whether or not the appellant was separated from his EAS-19 Labor Relations Specialist position before the agency assigned him to an EAS-16 position is also relevant to determining whether that assignment constituted a reduction in grade within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A fundamental principle defining the limits of the Board's jurisdiction is that an employee has no rights beyond those incident to the position to which he or she is officially appointed. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. General Services Administration</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 316, 320, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 12 F.3d 1069 (1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 114 S. Ct. 2673 (1994). If the appellant was not separated and his appointment as an EAS-19 Labor Relations Specialist did not terminate before his October 1996 assignment to the EAS-16 position, that assignment might constitute a reduction in grade within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 337, 340 (1996). If the agency did separate him and terminate his EAS-19 appointment before the October 1996 assignment, the appellant could not have claimed any rights as a current employee of the agency, <span class="Italic">see Anderson</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. at 320, and could only claim (as discussed above) entitlement to restoration to duty as an individual who had partially recovered from a compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that the October 1996 assignment did not amount to an appealable denial of restoration but failed to address and resolve the question of whether it constituted an appealable reduction in grade. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, and set forth the administrative judge's factual findings and conclusions of law). Because the record does not contain evidence resolving this jurisdictional question, the appeal must be remanded to determine whether or not the appellant was separated before his October 1996 assignment and whether that assignment thus constituted a reduction in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the administrative judge determines on remand that the appellant did suffer a reduction in grade, however, such a finding would not end the jurisdictional inquiry here. As noted above, the appellant accepted the agency's "permanent rehabilitation assignment" offer of restoration to duty. A reduction in grade that the appellant accepted voluntarily would not fall within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See O'Connell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 438, 443 (1996). Such an action would not be voluntary, however, if he showed that it was based on agency misinformation upon which he reasonably relied to his detriment based on an objective examination of the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Paszek v. Department of Defense</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 534, 538 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making its offer of restoration to duty, the agency stated that the position offered was at the EAS-19 level, but the position to which the appellant was ultimately appointed was at the EAS-16 level. The appellant has cited this offer in stating that he was "returned" or "restored" to an EAS-19 position only to discover "[i]mmediately upon my return" that he had been demoted to the EAS-16 level. Based on the record, then, he has presented a facially plausible argument that he relied on a material agency misrepresentation about the grade level of the position at issue in accepting assignment to it; if that assignment was a reduction in grade and the appellant established a claim of material misrepresentation, it would be involuntary and would fall within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Paszek</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 538-39 (appellant's reduction in grade held involuntary where he accepted it based on false representations by the agency about the step level of the position accepted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because she did not address this question, however, the administrative judge failed to advise the appellant of his jurisdictional burden of proof here and did not afford the parties the opportunity to submit evidence and argument in support of their respective positions. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue). The record thus is insufficiently developed for us to decide this question, although the appellant's allegations are plausible and nonfrivolous enough given the evidence of record to entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of his acceptance of a reduction in grade. <span class="Italic">See O'Connell</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 444.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AJs have the authority independently to evaluate medical evidence, with or without contradictory evidence, concerning the medical suitability of employees seeking restoration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Irlanda v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 289, 291 (1984).</p>
