<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-125"><span class="space">a.</span> Position Classification</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hinkel v. England</span>, 349 F.3d 162, 164-66 (3rd Cir. 2003), rejected use of mandamus against the employer to secure reclassification of a position or to implement a classification decision concerning a position. The court left the plaintiffs to their remedies with OSC through the prohibited personnel practice complaint route, leaving open the remote possibility of a mandamus case against OSC for breach of whatever responsibility OSC had to the employees. The court essentially determined that the availability of relief through OSC precluded direct relief in court against the employing agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Classification Act makes it the responsibility of each federal agency to place every position under its jurisdiction in the appropriate class and grade in conformity with standards published by the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5107. An employee who wishes to challenge the appropriateness of his position's classification may appeal to the OPM, which is authorized to, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> (1) "decide whether a position is in its appropriate class and grade"; and (2) "change a position from one class or grade to another class or grade when the facts warrant." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5112(a). The OPM is statutorily required to entertain an employee's appeal of his classification. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5112(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the past, courts reviewed classification decisions under mandamus jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Haneke v. Sec'y of Health, Educ.</span> <span class="Italic">&#x0026; Welfare,</span> 535 F.2d 1291 (D.C. Cir. 1976), for example, the court ordered the Civil Service Commission (OPM's predecessor agency) to determine whether the plaintiff should be reclassified based on the fact that other employees at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare were classified at a higher level even though they were doing the same work. <span class="Italic">See also United States v. Testan,</span> 424 U.S. 392, 401 n.5, 403, 96 S. Ct. 948, 47 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1976) (noting the availability of mandamus to compel prospective reclassification).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1978, however, Congress enacted the CSRA. The CSRA establishes a three-tiered scheme for review of personnel actions taken by federal agencies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;for major personnel actions specified in the statute ("adverse actions") [<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501-7701], direct judicial review after extensive prior administrative proceedings; (2) for specified minor personnel actions infected by particularly heinous motivations or disregard of law ("prohibited personnel actions"), review by the Office of Special Counsel [of the Merit Systems Protection Board], with judicial scrutiny "limited at most, to insuring compliance with the statutory requirement that the OSC perform an adequate inquiry," [<span class="Italic">Cutts v. Fowler</span>, 692 F.2d 138, 140 (D.C. Cir. 1982)] ; and (3) for the specified minor personnel actions not so infected, and for all other minor personnel actions, review by neither the OSC nor the courts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan,</span> 714 F.2d 171, 175 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Courts that have addressed the interplay between the Classification Act and the CSRA have concluded that classifications running afoul of the Classification Act qualify as "prohibited personnel actions" and therefore are subject to the CSRA's second tier of review. <span class="Italic">See Barnhart v. Devine,</span> 771 F.2d 1515, 1523 &#x0026; n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Karamonos</span> <span class="Italic">v. Egger,</span> 882 F.2d 447, 450 (9th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Towers v.</span> <span class="Italic">Horner,</span> 791 F.2d 1244, 1246-47 (5th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. The CSRA defines "prohibited personnel action," in part, as a personnel action where "the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11). The merit system principles codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301 include "[e]qual pay...for work of equal value." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(3). Similarly, a purpose behind the Classification Act is to promote "the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5101(l)(A). And the Act also requires that each position be placed in its appropriate class, and each class in its appropriate grade. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5106.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, an agency's failure to implement a reclassification--as appellants here allege--constitutes a "failure to act" that violates the CSRA's merit system principles. <span class="Italic">See Perdeaux v. United States,</span> 33 F. Supp.2d 187, 190 (E.D.N.Y. 1999); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.701 (a)(2) ("The personnel action must occur within a reasonable period of time following the date of the position action."). Thus an employee contending a failure to implement his classification must bring his complaint to the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"). The OSC must then "investigate the allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The result of the CSRA's review scheme is that it eliminates review of classification decisions of an agency or the OPM--including the failure to implement a reclassification--by way of writ of mandamus to the agency. That is so because the CSRA provides employees dissatisfied with their classification with other adequate means to attain their desired relief--review by the OSC. And insofar as suits for mandamus in the classification context survive the CSRA, an employee may only seek a writ of mandamus compelling the OSC to perform its statutory duty to conduct an adequate inquiry. <span class="Italic">Barnhart,</span> 771 F.2d at 1523-27. In other words, "by providing a new avenue of review, the CSRA altered the point at which mandamus potentially becomes available--that point at which no alternative remedy is available--as well as the entity against which mandamus may lie." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1527.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, appellants brought their complaint to the OSC. The OSC replied to appellants by explaining that "[t]he policy of the Office of Special Counsel is to await final action on such classification appeals by the agencies and the Office of Personnel Management, prior to taking action on complaints involving classification decisions." Because plaintiffs had not "exhausted the classification appeal process," the OSC declined to take further action at that time. Appellants claim that such exhaustion would have been futile.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We express no opinion about the exhaustion issue or about whether appellants may properly seek a writ of mandamus compelling OSC to perform an adequate inquiry before bringing their appeal to the OPM. At the very least, however, appellants have sought mandamus against the wrong entity. Appellants' claim for mandamus lies (if it lies at all) against the OSC.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our journey back in time begins in 1949, when Congress enacted the Classification Act. That statute vested in the old Civil Service Commission ("CSC" or "Commission"), and now vests in OPM, the responsibility to draft classification standards, 5 USC 5105 (1982), and to review agency compliance with those standards, 5 USC 5110(a) (1982). Under the classification system as originally conceived, each agency was responsible for applying the general classification standards in classifying its own employees. If the Civil Service Commission determined that a particular position had been improperly classified by an employing agency, the Commission issued a certificate reclassifying the position; as was true then and now, "the certificate [of the Commission, and now OPM] is binding on all administrative, certifying, payroll, disbursing, and accounting officials." 5 USC 5110(b) (1982). The system continues to operate in the same manner, except of course OPM, not the now-defunct Civil Service Commission, makes the classification determinations and issues certificates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time the Classification Act was enacted, only a single agency--the Civil Service Commission--was responsible both for drafting the initial classification standards and then hearing appeals in specific cases from the various agencies which applied and implemented the standards. The CSC appeals procedure was in the nature of an internal audit; it did not provide for a hearing "or for any outside third party review." In crafting a reform regime, the framers of the Civil Service Reform Act in the late 1970's viewed this lack of "minimal procedural guarantees," as well as the perceived inherent conflict between the CSC's role as administrator of the civil service system and its role in protecting that system from abuse, as primary reasons for substantially altering the system. Repeatedly throughout the hearings on the Civil Service Reform Act, members of Congress expressed concern that the new system be viewed as fair to employees and that it not discourage "whistleblowing." These goals, Congress concluded, could not be accomplished so long as the same body was responsible "for both the management of the civil service system and adjudication of complaints against the way the system is implemented." 124 Cong. Rec. S14,268 (1978) (Statement of Sen. Ribicoff), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 5, at 1608. Thus, as is now well known, Congress, in enacting the CSRA, abolished the Civil Service <span id="Page_5344"></span>Commission and divided the civil service functions among three newly-created bodies....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to avoid problems similar to those experienced with the CSC, Congress separated the prosecutorial arm from the adjudicatory apparatus of the MSPB, creating an independent Office of Special Counsel to investigate charges and to bring complaints before the MSPB.[9] <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 1206.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The Office was created to afford employees a remedial mechanism independent of the civil service system to which they could bring their grievances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 130, 162 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (role of OSC is that of ombudsman). The Office of Special Counsel can investigate charges and initiate Board proceedings but it cannot itself grant relief; that ultimate function is entrusted by Congress to the MSPB. To a great degree, therefore, the efficacy of the OSC as a remedy depends upon the efficacy of the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Layser v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Agric.</span>, 8 MSPB 72, 73 (1981) (relationship of Special Counsel to the MSPB is "that of a prosecuting attorney to a court"). There is, however, one sense in which the OSC can effect a remedy. An agency under OSC investigation has an incentive to settle the matter "out of court," as it were, inasmuch as a Board decision against the agency would obviously impact upon the agency's relationship with its employees in a way that settlement of the matter at the investigatory stage would not. In the latter case, the agency is obviously seen as taking an initiative in correcting abuses once they are brought to light by means of the OSC's investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Office of Special Counsel was granted authority to seek stays for fifteen days (or longer, upon MSPB authorization). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1208. Upon completion of any investigation, the Special Counsel was authorized to make recommendations to the employing agency, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(A), and require a report from the agency's head with respect to implementation of those recommendations, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 1206(b)(3)(A)(ii). If the agency fails to cooperate, the Office of Special Counsel can bring the matter before the MSPB, which in turn may issue subpoenas and seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B). In addition, the Special Counsel can "initiate disciplinary action against those who knowingly and willfully violate the merit principles." S. Rep. No. 900, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 5, at 1471. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1206(a)(1) (1982). The sanctions the OSC may recommend to the MSPB range from simple reprimands to demotions, suspensions, removals, debarment from Federal employment for up to five years and fines not to exceed $1,000<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1207(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR 1201.126(c) (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, an interplay pertinent to our case exists between OPM and MSPB. Specifically with respect to OPM, the MSPB was granted oversight authority "to review rules and regulations after they have been issued" either <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> or at the request of the Office of Special Counsel or any interested party. 124 CONG. REC. H9669 (1978) (Statement of Rep. Fisher), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 5, at 1120; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC 1205(e)(1) (1982). If the MSPB finds the rule or regulation to be in violation of merit system principles, the Board can invalidate it. <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> &#x00A7; 1205(e)(2). In order to facilitate the MSPB's oversight function, Congress granted the Board access to agency records, including those of OPM. 124 CONG. REC. S14,270 (1978) (Statement of Sen. Percy), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 5, at 1613; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 USC 1205(d)(3) (1982). Although in most respects OPM is treated like any other agency with respect to MSPB oversight, OPM was singled out for discussion during the Congressional debate on the CSRA for the very reason that this new separation of powers, as it were, represented an integral part of the overall reform of the civil service system. OPM could no longer, as the Civil Service Commission had allegedly done in some instances, manage the civil service system in an arbitrary and capricious manner and then, if challenged, uphold its own action upon review. In a word, it was of especial importance to Congress that OPM's actions be subject to independent review within the Executive Branch.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of all this, appellants urge to us that OPM now enjoys, as the CSC had previously, the final word on matters of classification; absent an abuse of discretion, appellants argue, OPM's classification determinations cannot be overturned. Appellants base their position upon sections 5110(b) and 5112(a) of the Classification Act, which as we have already observed provide that once OPM places a position "in its appropriate class and grade," OPM is then to certify this action to the agency, which, in turn, "[is required to] act in accordance with the certificate, and the certificate is thereafter binding," 5 USC 5110(b), 5112(a) (1982). <span class="Italic">See supra</span> page 1519. In a word, appellants maintain that once OPM has spoken in matters of classification, the apparatus of the Executive Branch comes to rest, and repair can then only be had to the Third Branch.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon analysis, appellants' argument is not at all unreasonable, but we conclude, after careful study, that it no longer rings true in this, the post-CSRA world. Although prior to the CSRA's passage, this description would seemingly have been accurate, leaving the courts as the sole avenue of review for persons aggrieved by adverse classification decisions by the old Civil Service Commission, this situation seems to us no longer to obtain. The statutory language which we quoted above was enacted prior to creation of the MSPB; even a very prescient Congress in crafting the Classification Act during the Presidency of Harry Truman could scarcely have contemplated the dispersal of functions three decades later to entities not even extant in 1949.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More fundamentally, to hold that the MSPB is irrevocably bound by an OPM classification decision would seriously undermine an important structural principle embodied in the CSRA. In fashioning that watershed statute, Congress clearly intended that MSPB would carry out a detached, quasi-judicial function. It was for this very reason that Congress provided for Presidential appointment of the three Board members, with the advice and consent of the Senate, "not more than 2 of whom may be adherents of the same political party." 5 USC 1201 (Supp. 1985). In this way, Congress sought, as we have seen, to avoid the conflict that arose when the same administrative body that managed the civil service system, including the establishment of its classification standards, also heard appeals from adverse classification determinations. Inasmuch as the level of compensation is, in large part, a function of classification, the manager of the civil service system has "a vested interest in keeping grades [i.e., classifications] down." 124 CONG. REC. H8468 (1978) (Statement of Rep. Ford), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 5, at 815. Thus, it was crucial to the CSRA's scheme that the independent, quasi-judicial body established by that statute--MSPB--be available to adjudicate classification appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the clearly manifested Congressional intent embodied in the CSRA, we conclude that a distinction must be drawn between classification determinations by OPM which bind the MSPB in the sense that the MSPB is an employer like any other employer, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, classification determinations that reach the MSPB through the investigatory apparatus of the CSRA. That is to say, whenever OPM determines that a particular job description should be classified under a particular GS level, that determination applies across the board to all agencies employing persons with a similar job description. However, whenever an agency, in the process of implementing a classification standard, allegedly violates a statute embodying a merit system principle and thereby commits a "prohibited personnel practice,"[12] it matters not at all that the adverse determination from which the employee appeals is a classification matter; for, in granting the MSPB authority to conduct adjudicatory proceedings respecting violations of merit system principles, Congress plainly intended to empower the MSPB to police all agencies and to be the final administrative word respecting prohibited personnel practices, even in the context of classification determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;In order to establish the occurrence of a prohibited personnel practice, "[i]t must be shown by a two-step analysis that the action (i) violates a law, rule, or regulation, and (ii) that the violated law, rule, or regulation is one which 'implements' or which 'directly concerns' the merit system principles." <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPB 199, 204, 1 MSPR 208, 215 (1979) (quoting 5 CFR 1250.3(b)(11) (1985)). <span class="Italic">See supra</span> note 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To return now from structural considerations to the chapter and verse of the operative statute, the Congressionally granted powers and functions of the MSPB include the review of rules and regulations promulgated by OPM. 5 USC 1205(a) (Supp. 1985). The review provision does not by its terms exclude review of classification rules or regulations; to the contrary, they appear to fall within the ambit of "any rule or regulation issued by the Director in carrying out his functions under section 1103 of this title." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1205(e)(1). Section 1103, in turn, details the functions of the Director of OPM; included among those functions are "classification activities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1103(a)(5)(B). In a word, if upon review, the MSPB determines that a classification rule or regulation is on its face invalid or invalid as implemented by a particular agency, it may, in the former instance, invalidate the rule or regulation or, in the latter instance, take corrective action against the employing agency. It thus appears that the MSPB may render classification decisions pursuant not only to its authority to hear petitions involving allegations of "prohibited personnel practices," but also by virtue of its authority to review OPM rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an additional argument, appellants contend that, despite the intervening passage of the Civil Service Reform Act, mandamus is still available to remedy situations in which OPM refuses to perform a ministerial act which it is required by law to perform. Appellants argue that by virtue of this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Haneke v. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare</span>, 535 F.2d 1291 (D.C. Cir. 1976), OPM, as successor to the Civil Service Commission, <span class="Italic">is required</span> to perform position-to-position comparisons;[13] thus, appellants argue, such a comparison constitutes a ministerial act. The argument further runs that mandamus is the appropriate judicial vehicle by which to proceed, inasmuch as the <span id="Page_5345"></span>requested comparison is a ministerial function that the Department of Commerce and OPM are both required to carry out but which each has studiously refused to perform. Citing this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Wren v. MSPB</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 873 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1982), appellants conclude that mandamus is still available despite passage of the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;Inasmuch as an employing agency makes initial classification determinations, this requirement would likewise apply to the employing agency, in this case the Department of Commerce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5107, 5112 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot agree with appellants' understanding either of the function of mandamus or the role of the Office of Special Counsel. It is, of course, elementary that mandamus is an extraordinary form of relief which lies only when no adequate alternative remedy exists....&#8197;As we have been, OPM is not the exclusive remedial situs for employees faced with adverse classification determinations.[14] Appellants could have and should have sought recourse through the Office of Special Counsel. Had the Special Counsel utterly failed to take action, mandamus would then lie to compel that Office to perform its statutory duty.[15]&#8205;&#8197;...This court's decision in <span class="Italic">Wren</span> does not stand for the proposition, as appellants would have it, that the Office of Special Counsel can be circumvented by means of mandamus against the allegedly errant agency.[16] Nor does <span class="Italic">Wren</span> stand for the extraordinary notion that mandamus would still be available to a complaining civil servant even though the potential avenue of relief afforded by the Office of Special Counsel had not been invoked. The only situation under which this state of affairs could obtain, it seems to us, is if the Office of Special Counsel procedure constituted, as appellants argue, an inadequate remedy. We turn now, as the final step in our analysis, to consider appellants' assertion that the Office of Special Counsel route would have been, at least in their case, inefficacious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;Appellants rely upon this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Atwell v. MSPB</span>, 670 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1981), to support their contention that the OSC has no authority over classification matters. Appellants' reliance is misplaced. The precise holding in <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> is that reductions in grade which trigger the grade and salary retention benefits of 5 USC 5366(b)(i) (1982) are not adverse actions <span class="Italic">directly</span> appealable to the MSPB pursuant to 5 USC 7312. Under the CSRA, only "adverse actions" are directly appealable to the MSPB; lesser personnel actions must be screened by the Office of Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;We need not here plumb the procedural depths of whether, under the particular statutory structure of the CSRA and the Classification Act, mandamus jurisdiction would lie with the District Court pursuant to the Mandamus Act, 28 USC 1361 (1982), or with the Federal Circuit pursuant to the Federal Courts Improvement Act, 5 USC 7703(b)(1) (1982)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Telecommunications Research &#x0026; Action Center v. FCC</span>, 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan</span>, 714 F.2d 171 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which we discussed previously, this court considered the impact of the CSRA on the availability of alternative remedies for aggrieved civil servants. Although <span class="Italic">Carducci</span> involved an action purportedly brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (1982), not under the Mandamus Act, 28 USC 1361 (1982), and the action complained of did not constitute a prohibited personnel practice, the opinion nonetheless contains instructions language relevant to our case. In finding that the challenged action was committed by law to agency discretion, the court in <span class="Italic">Carducci</span> observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[T]he exhaustive remedial scheme of the CSRA would be impermissibly frustrated by permitting, for lesser personnel actions not involving constitutional claims, an access to the courts more immediate and direct than the statute provides with regard to major adverse actions. 714 F.2d at 174.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">That principle is not without applicability to the instant case. Even major personnel actions, referred to as "adverse actions," must go through "extensive prior administrative proceedings" before judicial review is available. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 173. While appellants are seeking an order requiring OPM to engage in the classification review, as opposed to challenging substantive agency action, their resort to extraordinary judicial remedies, instead of repairing to the CSRA-provided remedial scheme, similarly works a frustration of Congress' carefully designed plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants briefly set forth several bases for their position that Congress could not have intended the Special Counsel to be "a replacement for the court's mandamus jurisdiction." Appellants contend, first, that "an employee is not obligated to file a complaint, and the nature of the inquiry conducted [by OSC] on the complaint is entirely discretionary," <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is, of course, true that an employee is not required to file a complaint in the obvious sense that no one is <span class="Italic">required</span> to seek redress of his or her grievance; but to state this self-evident proposition is emphatically not to say that if an employee does seek redress he or she is not required to utilize the proper procedures. Furthermore, although the <span class="Italic">nature</span> of the Special Counsel's inquiry is discretionary, the OSC cannot conduct, under the guise of an exercise of discretion, either an entirely inadequate inquiry or none at all. As this court observed in <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan</span>, 714 F.2d 171, 175 (D.C. Cir. 1983), limited judicial review is available to determine whether the Office of Special Counsel has complied with its statutory duty to conduct an investigation into allegations of "prohibited personnel practices." Furthermore, as we have already observed, this court stated in <span class="Italic">Wren</span> that even the extraordinary remedy of mandamus would be available to compel the Office of Special Counsel to perform its statutory responsibilities<span class="Italic">. See Wren, supra</span>, 681 F.2d at 875 n.9. Appellants' first argument is thus of no avail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, appellants suggest that the Office of Special Counsel "lacks the power to enforce [its] decision." Appellants are quite correct in this respect: the Special Counsel indeed lacks authority to compel compliance with its requests and recommendations. But at the same time, and critically for our analysis, the Office of Special Counsel, as appellants concede, may "petition the Board for enforcement." We can find nothing remarkable about this fact, inasmuch as the Special Counsel's role is essentially that of a prosecutor,...that Office naturally retains discretion to determine whether an appeal is meritorious and should be brought to the Board's attention. As we have also seen, however, the Special Counsel does not possess absolute discretion regarding whether to undertake any investigation at all to determine whether a federal employee's complaint is meritorious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants next contend that under <span class="Italic">Borrell v. United States Int'l Communications Agency</span>, 682 F.2d 981, 984-84 (D.C. Cir. 1982), "the employee may not seek judicial review of the Special Counsel's decision." Viewed in proper context, this language from <span class="Italic">Borrell</span> suggests nothing more than the Special Counsel's own view that the CSRA does not provide for judicial review of that Office's determination not to seek a stay pending the outcome of OSC's own investigations. In sum, an aggrieved employee may, as we have seen, seek a writ of mandamus to compel the OSC to investigate a complaint and, in addition, may seek limited judicial review of the OSC's determination that the complaint does not merit the Board's consideration. In the latter instance, judicial review is limited to determining whether the Special Counsel's investigation of the complaint constituted an adequate discharge of the Office's responsibilities under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See Carducci, supra</span>, 714 F.2d at 175 (citing <span class="Italic">Cutts, supra</span>, 692 F.2d at 140). While limited, that review nonetheless enables the court to determine whether the Office of Special Counsel had adequate information upon which to base its determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The <span class="Italic">Borrell</span> court decided that, with respect to <span class="Italic">constitutional</span> claims, the Special Counsel does not constitute an adequate alternative to a pre-existing right of judicial review. 682 F.2d at 990. Studying the legislative history of the CSRA, the court there determined that in the absence of a "clear signal...that Congress meant to deprive appellant of the only cause of action which she has to protect her constitutional rights," the Third Branch would not by decisional law eliminate a pre-existing cause of action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants of course do not advance a constitutional claim, which was the situation in <span class="Italic">Borrell.</span> Nor do appellants adequately explain their pre-existing cause of action. As we have seen, appeal to OPM in classification matters is still an available avenue of redress; that avenue constitutes, however, neither the final nor the sole determination of classification matters involving "prohibited personnel practice" allegations. And, what is more, mandamus jurisdiction has not been rendered entirely unavailable by the CSRA; by providing a new avenue of review, the CSRA altered the point at which mandamus potentially becomes available--the point at which no alternative remedy is available--as well as the entity against which mandamus may lie. Appellants thus fail on two counts: not only do they not allege the elimination of a pre-existing constitutional right of action, but beyond that lofty point they fail to allege the elimination of any cause of action, constitutional or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At day's end, we find unpersuasive appellants' specific arguments with respect to the asserted inadequacy of the remedy afforded by filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel. Moreover, we find no support for appellants' sweeping broadside that the OSC remedy is inefficacious and that their pursuit of it would be merely <span class="Italic">pro forma</span>. Nothing in the statute or in the regulations suggests that the Special Counsel is powerless to correct abuses of the civil service system. On the contrary, Congress clearly intended the OSC to be the watchdog of the merit system, a watchdog which should not be ignored by employees anxious to resort to federal court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are satisfied that appellants could have sought to utilize the OSC and that remedy was potentially efficacious. Appellants' failure to utilize this alternative remedy precludes the availability of a writ of mandamus to compel OPM to make position-to-position comparisons.</p>

Cir. 1976) (position-to-position classification could be required of the Civil Service Commission upon appeal by employees, and judicial review may be had by individually aggrieved employees who have exhausted their CSC remedies), and <span class="Italic">Jarecki v. United States</span>, 590 F.2d 670 (7th Cir. 1979) (plaintiffs could sue for review of their classifications when they claimed that they were performing but not being paid for higher-level work, but they first had to exhaust their remedies with the Civil Service Commission). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Briley v. NARA</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (regulations require classification decisions based on classification standards, not on the basis of a comparison of the duties of an individual with the duties of other employees; a comparison of employees' duties would perpetuate existing misclassifications); <span class="Italic">Skrobot v. United States</span>, 534 F.2d 237, 241 (Ct. Cl. 1975) ("The Agency's failure to comply with the annual review requirements did not grant any legal right to a promotion for Plaintiff, nor did it subject the Agency to the outlandish liability of allocating vested promotion rights outside the normal competitive merit system to employees whose jobs were merely not reviewed on time."). A court presumed that it had jurisdiction over a mandamus action to secure reclassification of plaintiffs in a class action, but relief was denied on the merits; an appropriate official had not finally approved the reclassification of the class members' positions. <span class="Italic">Perdeaux v.
