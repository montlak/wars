<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-9"><span class="space">1.</span> Incomplete Analysis; Failure to Mention All Evidence</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Addison v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 30 MSPR 615, 617-18 (1986), reiterated that the job of an attorney-examiner employed as an AJ is to analyze issues and facts and write in a fashion that reflects a cogent and complete analysis of each charge and of the determinative evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the presiding official's conclusions of law. <span class="Italic">Spithaler</span>.... The presiding official relegated his discussion of the substantial evidence issue to a single footnote in his initial decision. Moreover, even though he stated that "the notice of proposed removal identifies numerous specifications of alleged performance deficiencies under each critical element," the presiding official failed to specifically address the manner in which those alleged deficiencies were established by the agency or how he ultimately came to conclude that they were sufficient to meet the agency's substantial evidence burden of proof. The presiding official also failed to state whether he found the testimony of appellant's former supervisor...to be credible with regard to the alleged performance deficiencies even though he found her testimony, with regard to personal animus and reprisal, to be incredible.... While the Board must necessarily defer to the presiding official's credibility determinations, especially where those findings are based on the demeanor of the witnesses, the presiding official must nevertheless fully set forth the reasons for his findings in the initial decision in order for the Board to defer to such findings....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dodson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 386, 391 (1987), admonished as to the essential qualities of initial decisions, as it remanded an initial decision as a result of inadequate analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's notice of proposed removal consisted of four charges comprised of eleven separate specifications, each based upon a distinct factual predicate. In her initial decision, however, the administrative judge does not state the specifications, identify all material issues of fact, or summarize the evidence on each issue sufficiently to disclose the evidentiary basis for her conclusion that the agency's charges were sustained. She also fails to state the legal reasons and authorities upon which she bases her conclusions of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant identifies numerous alleged inconsistencies in the agency's evidence and the testimony of its witnesses on several of the charges and specifications, with citations to the record. While we do not here express any opinion on the merits of those allegations, the administrative judge failed to address them and thus to afford us an explained and reasoned adjudication to review....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Only a stipulation between the parties will satisfy a party's burden of proof on a matter; otherwise, the AJ must issue a decision containing findings of facts and the reasons or bases for those findings on all material issues. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. VA</span>, 9 MSPR 476, 478 (1982). It is within the discretion of the AJ, as the trier of fact, to make determinations on the materiality of evidence and to weigh the probative value of evidentiary submissions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eikenberry v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 37 MSPR 438, 445 (1988). Those determinations must be explained. The initial decision should not be conclusory; it should summarize the evidence submitted by the parties and explain the reasoning used in arriving at legal findings. <span class="Italic">Condaxis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 7 MSPR 467, 469, 7 MSPB 331 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Colbert v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 467, 470 &#x00B6; 6 (2003) ("The AJ reduced more than a box of documents and over 350 pages of testimony to four double-spaced pages of facts and analysis. Although brevity can be good, the ID left us asking how the agency could have failed to prove that the appellant's undisputed conduct...was actionable misconduct."); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Eubanks,</span> 76 MSPR 405, 413-14, 418 (1997) (faulting an ALJ decision because it failed to summarize and consider all relevant evidence under each specification; the Board must have the "benefit of the ALJ's determinations of fact, reasoning and assessment of the evidence"; requirements governing initial (or recommended) decisions apply whether the case is brought under the Board's original jurisdiction (OSC complaint) or under its appellate jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">George v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 269, 271 (1984) (inappropriate for an AJ to omit the findings as to whether the charged conduct occurred, to assume the charges to be true, and to determine that the charged conduct would not support a removal); <span class="Italic">Pledger v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 456, 458 (1987) (noting lack of adequate findings); <span class="Italic">Pittman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Potter I</span>, Tiffany Potter petitioned this court for review of the Board's December 13, 2018 decision denying corrective action in her claim filed under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Board determined that Ms. Potter failed to show a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that her July 10, 2014 email was a contributing factor to her nonselection by the Department of Veterans Affairs ("agency") for Chief Nurse IV in November 2015. <span class="Italic">See Potter I</span>, 949 F.3d at 1379. We vacated that portion of the 2018 decision because it relied on a finding that the parties agreed was erroneous--i.e., that Dr. Deering (who canceled the Chief Nurse IV vacancy in November 2015) did not know of Ms. Potter's July 10, 2014 email. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1379-81. We remanded with instructions to the Board to "consider whether, in view of Dr. Deering's knowledge of Ms. Potter's July 10, 2014 email, Ms. Potter presented evidence sufficient to satisfy the knowledge-timing test [of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)], or if Ms. Potter otherwise presented evidence sufficient to demonstrate a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of whistleblower reprisal," and if so, to "consider whether the [agency] [could] meet its burden of showing that it would have taken the same November 2015 personnel action regardless of Ms. Potter's protected disclosure." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1380.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ found that a preponderance of the evidence established that the July 10, 2014 email was a protected disclosure and that it was a contributing factor to Ms. Potter's November 2015 nonselection. The AJ then considered whether the agency demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same November 2015 personnel action in the absence of the July 10, 2014 protected disclosure. The AJ's consideration in this regard was guided by the factors articulated in <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999)--namely, (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. J.A. 8-16 (assessing these three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors). The AJ concluded that the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor weighed "heavily" in the agency's favor, that the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor weighed "modestly" in Ms. Potter's favor, and that the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor was neutral. As a result of its <span class="Italic">Carr</span> analysis, the Board found that the agency demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same November 2015 personnel action in the absence of the July 10, 2014 protected disclosure. It therefore denied corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When addressing whether the government has shown that it would have taken the same personnel action absent a protected disclosure, "[i]f considerable countervailing evidence is manifestly ignored or disregarded in finding [the] matter clearly and convincingly proven, the decision must be vacated and remanded for further consideration where all the pertinent evidence is weighed." <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Ms. Potter argues that in conducting its <span class="Italic">Carr</span> analysis, the Board's decision failed to consider certain evidence that may have detracted from its overall conclusion. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Potter observes that Dr. Deering had to testify before Congress about the patient-care crisis at the Phoenix VA Health Care System, whereupon he was asked why he hadn't been fired. She notes that he had received death threats. And she cites his testimony that he was "feeling frustrated because people were going to the [Inspector General]," and that he "just wished they would come to [him] and say here's what it is so we could tackle it together." According to Ms. Potter, this and other evidence not addressed in the Board's decision detract from the reasons the agency gave for its November 2015 nonselection and indicate the presence of a retaliatory motive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency disputes the import of the evidence that Ms. Potter cites. But the extent to which such evidence affects a Carr analysis involves factual questions for the Board--not this court in the first instance. And, as to evidence that the Board's decision failed to evaluate (including that set forth above), we cannot be assured that it was given the consideration and weight appropriate in a <span class="Italic">Carr</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1376 ("While we acknowledge that the [Board] may well have considered the countervailing evidence and rejected or discounted it for various reasons, with no basis in [its] opinion to understand [its] logic, we cannot say that [its] analysis is reasonable or complies with the law for how proof by clear and convincing evidence is to be evaluated."). Remand is therefore appropriate. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1368. On remand, the Board is not limited to considering evidence bearing on Dr. Deering's motives; rather, it should also consider any record evidence suggesting a retaliatory motive on the part of other agency officials and the extent to which such officials influenced Dr. Deering's decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1371 ("When a whistleblower makes...highly critical accusations of an agency's conduct, an agency official's merely being outside that whistleblower's chain of command, not directly involved in alleged retaliatory actions,...is insufficient to remove the possibility of a retaliatory motive or retaliatory influence on the whistleblower's treatment.").</p>
