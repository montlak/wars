<p class="Body-Text">Without regard to EEO allegations, the Board generally excuses otherwise timely misfilings within the civil service administrative infrastructure.

GSA</span>, 82 MSPR 679, 681 n.2 (1999) ("[F]or purposes of determining the timeliness of a petition for review, the filing of a petition for review with the Board's regional or field office will be <span id="Page_1791"></span>deemed a filing with the Board."); <span class="Italic">Beyer v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 672, 674-75 (1988) (Board treated as a timely PFR a timely letter to the regional office protesting, for lack of a hearing, an adverse initial decision); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. EEOC</span>, 35 MSPR 602, 603 n.1 (1987) (dismissal of a PFR would be "unduly harsh" when it was filed with the regional office rather than with the Clerk of the Board); <span class="Italic">Birch v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 12, 12 n.2 (1986) (PFR treated as timely filed when it is timely but inadvertently mailed to the regional office of the Board); <span class="Italic">Jorgensen v.

USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 44, 47 (1998) (treating as a PFR objections to a removal decision when the objections contained in the compliance pleading arose from an earlier Board appeal); <span class="Italic">Andrews v. DHHS</span>, 70 MSPR 202, 205 (1996) (response to a PFR faxed to the regional office rather than to MSPB headquarters constituted a timely filing of the response); <span class="Italic">Kemp v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 67 MSPR 198, 200 (1995) (recognizing that the clock is stopped when a PFR is filed with a regional office, but the regional filing must still be timely); <span class="Italic">Menchaca v.

OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 126, 128 (1991) (treating as a PFR a letter to the AJ raising objections to the initial decision); <span class="Italic">Berteletti v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 1, 5-6 (1990) (complaint to the regional office concerning the disposition of a compliance petition should have been forwarded by the region to the Board as a PFR); <span class="Italic">Collett v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 38 MSPR 128, 130 (1988) (request to the regional office for reconsideration of an initial decision was treated as a PFR); <span class="Italic">Wilson v.

DHS</span>, 119 MSPR 343, 346-47 n.3, 2012 MSPB 112 (2012) (Member Robbins dissenting), when the Board excused an untimely PFR that was delivered to OSC within the deadline for a PFR, but the PFR did not get to the Board until after the filing deadline when petitioner's counsel discovered the delivery error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further asserts on review that the Board should find good cause for his filing delay because OSC is an office of the Board and "a filing with the wrong Board office is considered filed with the appropriate office on the date the incorrect office received it, as a matter of law." However, while the appellant correctly notes that the Board has held that filing with OSC is filing with the Board, albeit the wrong Board office for filing a petition for review, <span class="Italic">see Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 315-16 (1984), OSC has since become an agency independent from the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1211. The Board has held that misdirection of an appeal to an organization that is not affiliated with the Board does not in itself constitute good cause for late filing. <span class="Italic">Story v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 222, 226 n.4 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered a request for an extension of time to file a PFR even though the request was made with the Board office that issued the initial decision rather than with the Board's Office of the Clerk. <span class="Italic">Andrus v. IRS</span>, 14 MSPR 500, 502 n.2, 13 MSPB 150 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fousek v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 48 MSPR 328, 329 n.1 (1991) ("If the petition...was erroneously filed with the Board's regional office, the Board considers the date it was filed to be the date it was filed with the Board"). If the Board has no record of a PFR allegedly misfiled with a regional office, the appellant should explain when or how he filed the PFR or submit copies of documents that he claims were earlier mailed to the Board. <span class="Italic">Sumner v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 542, 544 &#x00B6; 4 (2001); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Abney v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 305, 310 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (the appellant did not state when he filed paperwork or what he filed, and no copies were submitted: "The Board has no record of receiving such filings...and the appellant has presented no evidence to support his assertions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A PFR addressed to an MSPB regional office is considered filed with the Board on the date that it was filed with the region. <span class="Italic">Burkhalter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 190, 192 n.2 (1991). If the petition was untimely when it was filed with the wrong office, the Board will apply its customary rules to determine whether the delay should be excused. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schlottman v. Perez</span>, 739 F.3d 21, 27 (D.C. Cir. 2014) ("Moreover, were we to interpret the savings clause as Schlottman urges--preserving claims that are timely with respect to the wrong forum--we would effectively allow, and perhaps even incent, complainants to seek out improper forums with more favorable deadlines in order to "save" untimely claims.); <span class="Italic">Sullivan-Brooks v. VA</span>, 53 MSPR 405, 407 (1992) ("Even assuming that the appellant's error in misdirecting her petition for review to the regional office was excusable, the petition was untimely by more than 4 years."); <span class="Italic">Spears v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 52 MSPR 695, 697 (1992) (PFR was sent late to regional office); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Fleming v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 409, 411 (1991) (PFR was improperly directed to OPM, but inexcusably late).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some filings made with the regional offices are clearly PFRs and the issue is only one of timeliness. At other times, the material sent by an appellant to the region is not so clearly identified. It can occur that a party files a submission with the regional office, while a case is pending at the region but at about the same time the region is issuing an initial decision. The region may then forward the submission from the party to the MSPB to be treated as a PFR. The Board's headquarters establishment then determines how to treat the constructively-created PFR when it receives subsequent submissions from the parties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 102 MSPR 642, 644 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2006 MSPB 226 (2006) (determining that a document should have been treated as response to an enforcement petition rather than a PFR). The Board examines communications to regional offices claimed by appellants to constitute PFRs to determine the timeliness and content of the filings, <span class="Italic">Fassler v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 672, 675-76 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has waived the filing deadline when an appellant timely filed a document that can be construed as a petition for review with the regional or field office because "the failure of the appellant to direct an otherwise timely petition for review to the appropriate office should not have the effect of denying him a determination on the issues raised in his petition." <span class="Italic">Collett v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 38 MSPR 128, 130 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 868 F.2d 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). Thus, we will examine the May 8 and October 26, 1995, letters that the appellant claims to have sent to the administrative judge to determine if either of these letters can be construed as a petition for review of the April 6, 1995, initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's May 8, 1995, letter does not mention the discrimination allegations pertaining to the demotion action. Rather, the letter deals solely with issues related to a compliance RIF, e.g., the appellant informs the administrative judge that he sought clarification from the agency's personnel office regarding the "best offer" in any compliance RIF, and he asks the administrative judge whether, in any such RIF, he must accept a "best offer" in order to have appeal rights to the Board. Likewise, the appellant's October 26, 1995, letter to the administrative judge concerns only issues related to the acceptance of a "best offer" in the compliance RIF. Because the May 8 and October 26, 1995, letters do not concern the demotion action which was the subject of the April 6, 1995, initial decision, nor do they mention the issue of whether the administrative judge should have adjudicated the discrimination claim raised with respect to that action, we do not construe either letter as being a petition for review of the initial decision. We therefore find that neither letter provides good cause for waiving the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">Cf. Collett</span>, 38 MSPR at 130 (correspondence submitted to the regional office contained the issues that the appellant sought to have reviewed by the Board; correspondence was construed to be a petition for review).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A PFR filed with the Board that appears to raise a likely timely appellate claim may be forwarded to the regional office for adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. DOD</span>, AT-3443-13-3415-I-1 (NP 4/25/2014) ("The petition for review was filed less than 30 days after the appellant received the agency's decision to indefinitely suspend him, effective October 2013. The appellant has not filed a separate appeal of this suspension. Based on the proximity of the petition for review to the effective date of the indefinite suspension, as well as the contents of the petition for review, we find that the appellant, who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, intended to appeal his indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patton v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 542, &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (finding, based on arguments raised on petition for review, that the appellant intended to file an appeal from a new suitability determination); <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 488, &#x00B6; 4 (2009) (liberally construing a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's petition for review to be a challenge to an initial decision, rather than a new appeal of a subsequent agency action).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A PFR misdirected to the employing agency, but otherwise timely, is likely to be accepted by the Board<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 335, 336 n.* (1983) ("However, the petition was filed timely to the agency and the agency was able to respond in a timely manner. Thus, we find that good cause was shown to waive appellant's time limit."). But the Board is not inclined to allow as timely PFRs misdirected to OPM if OPM has nothing to do with the appeal before it gets to the PFR stage. <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 376, 378-79 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Catalano v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 432, 435 n.1 (1984) (declining to consider the agency's response to a PFR that was sent to OPM when the agency was on notice as to where the response should have been sent). OPM received a PFR only because OPM was listed on the certificate of service of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">St. Pierre v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 98, 100-01 (1992), rejected the PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, in certain circumstances, a timely filing with OPM may constitute a filing with the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Patterson v. OPM</span>, 51 MSPR 408, 410 (1991) (appellant established good cause for untimely filing of petition for appeal from OPM's reconsideration decision, where he mistakenly filed second request for reconsideration with OPM). This case is clearly distinguishable from that line of cases, though. While both involve a mistaken filing with OPM, the dispositive difference is that the mistake in the instant case cannot be excused as a reasonable <span id="Page_1792"></span>misinterpretation because OPM has played no role in these proceedings. It was neither the agency that issued the decision from which the appeal was taken, nor was it the appellant's former employer. Rather, it is a complete stranger to the controversy. The entire extent of OPM's role in the appeal, until the appellant served his petition for review on it, was that it was listed as a recipient of the initial decision on the certificate of service accompanying it. Thus, the obligation that the Board has placed on OPM in other cases to forward to the Board what it should have recognized as a misdirected filing would not logically attach here.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Nor is the appellant assisted by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(f), which provides that a timely filing with the wrong agency is to be treated as though it were properly filed, inasmuch as section 7702 applies only to cases involving issues of discrimination. No such issue was raised in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has not shown good cause for his untimely filing because he has not shown due diligence under the circumstances. His explanation that he was confused and that he filed the petition for review with OPM instead of the Board does not show such behavior as might be excusable or expected on the part of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances. In this connection, we note that the appellant has not alleged that his confusion was caused by the initial decision. Indeed, the initial decision clearly stated that a petition seeking Board review must be filed with the Clerk of the Board and provided the appellant with both the proper address for filing his petition and the deadline by which he must do so. Finally, the appellant did not show due diligence, given that he did not correct his error and file his petition with the Board at all until several months after the deadline passed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Maniago v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 553, 557-58 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the appellant has failed to establish good cause for the untimely filing of his petition....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One might ask why, if OPM is a "complete stranger to the controversy," its address is placed on the Board's service sheet. To avoid confusing some appellants, the Board could use, and appears to now be using, a separate process (transmittal by e-filing) to ensure the mailing of initial decisions to OPM in a manner that avoids reference to OPM on the certificate of service accompanying an initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other decisions essentially default appellants who file their PFRs with OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Madonti v. Dept. of Army</span>, 97 MSPR 660, 663 &#x00B6; 7 (2004) ("There does not appear to have been any reason for the appellant to have mailed his petition to OPM, as OPM had no involvement in this appeal.") <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 203 (1994) ("Although the appellant presented specific, credible evidence that he timely mailed his petition for review to the agency, such mailing will not be treated as a timely filing with the Board," citing <span class="Italic">Kelly,</span> <span class="Italic">post</span>); <span class="Italic">Olivares v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 113, 115 (1993) (untimely PFR was not excused on the basis of an unsworn and unsupported claim that the petition was filed with the OPM "reconsideration staff"; an additional delay of 14 months after the initial decision became final before inquiring of status of the PFR did not demonstrate the due diligence necessary to establish good cause for the untimely filing); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 102, 104 (1992) (timely but deficient PFR was not excused when the appellant's correspondence showing the correction of deficiencies was sent to OPM, not involved in the appeal, rather than to Board, and when the appellant did not inquire of the Board as to the status of a case for more than a year after his correspondence to OPM). <span class="Italic">Olivares</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was affirmed on review, <span class="Italic">Olivares v. MSPB</span>, 17 F.3d 386, 388 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board will waive the 35-day time limit for filing a petition for review and allow an untimely filing only for good cause shown. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, 1201.114(f) (1993). According to the board, in order to show good cause for an untimely filing, "a party must show that he exercised diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980)." The board's practice regarding untimely filed petitions for review has been characterized as strict.... The MSPB has broad discretion to control its own docket and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the board in this regard. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. United States Postal Service</span>, 695 F.2d 1389, 1390 (Fed. Cir. 1982). This court will affirm the board's decision to dismiss an untimely filed petition for review unless the decision is shown to have been "arbitrary, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1988)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board found that Olivares did not show good cause for delaying fourteen months to file his petition for review with the board. The MSPB found that Olivares presented no evidence to support his assertion that he mailed a letter for reconsideration of the MSPB's initial decision to the OPM's "Reconsideration Staff." In addition, the MSPB relied on the fact that Olivares's sworn statement of good cause in support of his untimely filed petition, signed under penalty of perjury, did not mention the mailing.... The board further found that even if Olivares mailed the letter to the OPM, Olivares failed to explain why he waited fourteen months to petition for review after the initial decision became final and why he did not make any inquiry during that time. Under the circumstances, the board concluded that Olivares failed to exercise due diligence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not excuse a conscious decision by an appellant to file a PFR with the wrong organization or office--even when the filing is to the AJ through "numerous" reconsideration requests, <span class="Italic">Whitley v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 181, 184-85 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will waive its timeliness requirements pursuant to statute in situations where a petition for review was timely, but mistakenly filed with a forum that lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will not waive those requirements, however, when another forum was consciously elected by the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marenus v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 39 MSPR 498, 503 (1989). Such a "conscious election" may include the option to incorrectly file a petition with an agency (or regional office) instead of the Board where: (1) Actual notice has been given by the administrative judge to the appellant that the petition must be filed with the Board; or (2) the record reflects that the appellant knew that the petition had to be filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's letters to the administrative judge did not constitute instances of mistaken filings, since the administrative judge directed him to file a petition with the Board before expiration of the deadline for filing a petition for review. The appellant, however, refused to follow these instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Maniago</span> <span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 MSPR 553, 557 (July 30, 1990), the Board held that an appellant's "persistence in continuing to write OPM, thereby further delaying his appeal to the Board, in spite of clear notice that his appeal rights lay with the Board, [did] not demonstrate either prudence or diligence under the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Likewise, in this case, the record shows that the appellant had full knowledge of his appeal rights, but that he chose instead to ignore the administrative judge's notice of where to file his petition, and waited until approximately three months after the December 5, 1989 deadline to file his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980)....</p>
