<p class="Body-Text">The 1994 Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) established jurisdiction in the Board to consider claims alleging improper denial of reemployment rights or discrimination in federal employment on account of military service. <span class="Italic">Vandesande v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 190, 194 (1997). The encompassing scope of USERRA was mentioned in <span class="Italic">Timberlake v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 172, 177 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n addition to prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a person's status as a veteran as to personnel actions such as the alleged constructive demotion, USERRA prohibits discrimination as to any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest that accrues by reason of an employer policy, plan, or practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the importance of USERRA, <span class="Italic">Beck v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210514269">997 F.3d 1171</a>, 1191 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (Judge Taranto concurring), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We cannot correct every wrong in society; but we remedy this wrong today. Working-class men and women striving to improve their lives must frequently overcome great barriers--including increasing inequality, insidious discrimination, and the lack of access to opportunity--in the arduous path to success. In a world where inequities often go unchecked, the judiciary stands as a beacon of hope to ensure that justice and the <span id="Page_444"></span>values and principles that form the bedrock of democracy do not become a mere afterthought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Honest and hardworking members of our military aspiring to improve their lives deserve to be treated with equality and respect under the law, regardless of social status or the scope of their military service or related duties. That is the overarching purpose of the USERRA, which pays homage to all our military service members who, day in and out, help to strengthen the backbone of our country through their countless contributions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clavin v. USPS</span>, 99 MSPR 619, 622-624 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2005), described the two types of appeals that generally arise under USERRA--those involving allegations concerning the denial of reemployment rights and those that involve allegations of discrimination based on military service of the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two types of cases that arise under USERRA: (i) Reemployment cases, in which the appellant claims that an agency has not met its obligations under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 following the appellant's absence from civilian employment to perform uniformed service; and (ii) what have come to be known by the shorthand label as "discrimination" cases, in which the appellant claims that an agency has committed one of seven actions that are prohibited if motivated by one of nine enumerated reasons. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), (b).[1] The Board's jurisdiction over both reemployment cases and so-called "discrimination" cases is based on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b), (c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The following are the specific prohibitions in USERRA that collectively have come to be known by the catch-all term "discrimination":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;An employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter, (2) has testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under this chapter, (3) has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under this chapter, or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter. The prohibition in this subsection shall apply with respect to a person regardless of whether that person has performed service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the merits, reemployment cases and discrimination cases differ in two important ways. First, an individual's rights under the reemployment provisions of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318, do not depend on the motivation for an agency's action (or inaction), whereas an essential element of a discrimination claim is that the contested agency decision was based on an improper motivation, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), (b). Second, in a reemployment case the agency bears the burden of proving that it met its statutory obligations, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See DePascale v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 186, 190 (1993); <span class="Italic">Britton v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 170, 172-73 (1984).[2] By contrast, in a discrimination case the appellant bears the burden of proof on the merits, and if that burden is met the agency may avoid relief by showing that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the improper motivation. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c); <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">DePascale</span> and <span class="Italic">Britton</span> cases arose under pre-USERRA reemployment laws at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-2024 (1982 ed. &#x0026; 1988 ed.) and were within the Board's jurisdiction under OPM's rules at 5 C.F.R. Part 353. In 1994 USERRA reenacted (with modification) the reemployment laws, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318; created a cause of action for "discrimination," 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311; and made the Board's jurisdiction over both reemployment and "discrimination" cases statutory, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b), (c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the administrative judge's order on jurisdiction referred only to USERRA's prohibition on "discrimination." In his response on jurisdiction below and in his petition for review, however, the appellant alleges that the agency violated his reemployment rights following separation from active-duty military service when he states that, after being discharged from active duty in 2002, he "returned to his place of employment to face a number of directly specific reemployment rights," namely, "[d]enial of health benefits," "[d]enial of seniority," "[n]o credit for pension/retirement," "[n]ot allowing [me] to work within my limitations," and [d]enying...employment because of service-connected disability." The appellant might also be attempting to raise a discrimination claim. The appellant was entitled to notice of the elements of USERRA jurisdiction and an opportunity to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Since he did not receive such notice and opportunity, the appeal must be remanded.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The distinction between reemployment cases and discrimination cases is critical in the present case. We now turn to some specific rules governing reemployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With exceptions that do not appear applicable in this case, an individual entitled to reemployment by the Federal Government upon completion of a period of service in the uniformed services shall be reemployed in a position of employment as described in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4314(a). With respect to a person such as the appellant, whose period of service was for more than 90 days, section 4313 provides the following order of priority regarding the position to which the person is entitled to be reemployed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4),[6] in the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than 90 days--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service, <span class="Italic">or a position of like seniority, status and pay</span>, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;in the position of employment in which the person was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services, or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform, only if the person is not qualified to perform the duties of a position referred to in subparagraph (A) after reasonable efforts by the employer to qualify the person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Subparagraph (3) addresses the situation in which a person who has a disability incurred in, or aggravated during, the period of service in the uniformed services is not qualified, due to the disability, to be employed in the position in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person had not been interrupted by such service. Subparagraph (4) addresses the situation in which the person entitled to reemployment is not qualified, and cannot become qualified with reasonable efforts by the employer, for the position in which the person would have been employed, or for the position in which the person was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services, for reasons other than disability incurred or aggravated during such service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(3), (4). There is no evidence in the current record to suggest that the appellant incurred or aggravated a disability during his period of military service nor to suggest that the appellant is not qualified for the position in which he was employed on the date of the commencement of that service. Thus, on the basis of the current record, the facts of this case do not appear to implicate either of these subparagraphs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.207(b). Thus, assuming that the appellant otherwise met the eligibility requirements for reemployment following completion of his active duty military service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312 (describing the requirements an individual must meet to be entitled to reemployment rights and benefits and other employment benefits of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code), the agency was required to reemploy the appellant in the position in which he would have been employed if his military service had not interrupted his continuous employment, or, if the appellant was not qualified for that position, the agency was required to reemploy him in a position of like seniority, status, and pay, the duties of which he was qualified to perform. The agency could meet its USERRA obligations to reemploy the appellant by assigning him to the position he held on the date his military service commenced, or a position of like seniority, status, and pay, only if the appellant was not qualified for the position he would have been in, or one of like seniority, status, and pay, after reasonable efforts by the agency to qualify the appellant for such a position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge did not provide the parties with proper notice concerning the applicable USERRA standard. Rather than apprising the parties of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4314, i.e., those sections of USERRA that control reemployment by the federal government following an absence necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services, the administrative judge's summary of the telephonic status conference suggested that the appeal was governed by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, the section of USERRA that prohibits specified actions against persons because they once served in the uniformed services, have a <span id="Page_445"></span>present obligation to perform such service, or assisted someone else in exercising USERRA rights. Furthermore, rather than defining the issue in the appeal as whether the agency properly reemployed the appellant in the correct position upon completion of his period of military service, the administrative judge defined the issue as whether the "agency denied the appellant a benefit of employment following his return to work after performing military service." After noting that the first subissue was whether the appellant was entitled to be reemployed in a PS-03 or a PS-05 position, the administrative judge incorrectly advised the parties that the resolution of that issue depended on the appellant's status when he was deployed. However, as noted above, the proper initial inquiry in a USERRA reemployment case involving a person whose military service was for more than 90 days must begin not with a determination regarding the position in which the person was employed when the military service commenced, but with a determination regarding the position in which the person would have been employed if his continuous employment with the agency had not been interrupted by his military service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A). The position in which the person was employed when the military service commenced is the position to which the person is entitled to be reemployed only if the evidence establishes that the person would have been in that same position if his continuous employment with the agency had not been interrupted by his military service, or the evidence otherwise establishes that the appellant was not qualified to perform the duties of the position in which the person would have been employed, or a position of like seniority, status, and pay, after reasonable efforts by the employer to qualify such a person. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(B).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">USERRA</span>: The provisions of USERRA (codified at chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code) covering Federal employees apply to claims that a Federal agency employer or the Office of Personnel Management has failed or refused to provide an employment or reemployment right or benefit to which a person is entitled after service in a uniformed service (other than claims relating to benefits under the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees). USERRA also applies to claims of discrimination based on uniformed service in connection with initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment (38 USC 4311(a)) and claims of reprisal (38 USC 4311(b)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Persons Covered</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">USERRA:</span> The reemployment provisions of USERRA apply to persons who have left their employment for service in a uniformed service, provided they satisfy the Act's requirements relating to such matters as advance notice to the employer, cumulative length of absence, character of service, and the time limits for reporting back to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA anti-discrimination provision is broader; it applies to anyone <span id="Page_447"></span>who has served, applied to serve, or has an obligation to serve in a uniformed service. (It applies <span class="Italic">only</span> to such a person; there is no derived right for a parent or spouse to claim discrimination based on a person's uniformed service; <span class="Italic">see Lourens v. MSPB,</span> Fed. Cir. No. 99-3153, October 13, 1999.) The prohibition against reprisal in USERRA applies to anyone who exercises a right under the Act, assists someone else to exercise such a right, or testifies in a proceeding under the Act, regardless of whether the person alleging reprisal has served in a uniformed service.</p>

The Board has ruled that a person who files a formal complaint with the Secretary of Labor must exhaust the procedures of the Department of Labor before an appeal may be filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Department of the Interior,</span> 71 MSPR 227 (1996).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">USERRA</span>: USERRA contains no statutory time limit for filing a complaint either with the Secretary of Labor or with the Board.

Such representation is available only where the person has filed a USERRA complaint with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary has notified the person that the Department of Labor cannot resolve the complaint, and the person asks the Secretary to refer the complaint to the Special Counsel. There is no provision for representation by the Special Counsel where a person files a USERRA appeal directly with the Board. Regardless of whether a USERRA appellant files with the Board directly, after exhausting the procedures of the Department of Labor, or after the Special Counsel has declined to represent the appellant, he may choose a representative in accordance with the Board's regulations at 5 CFR 1201.31.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of this information sheet is to provide general guidance and background information. It does not represent an official statement approved by the Board itself, and is not intended to provide legal counsel or to be cited as legal authority. Instead, it is intended only to help the public become familiar with the MSPB and its procedures. In all instances, however, the MSPB's regulations and current case law control with respect to matters discussed here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What is the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 or USERRA is a federal law designed to encourage non-career service in the uniformed services by minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service; to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed service by providing prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of military service; and to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What types of agency actions are appealable to the Board under USERRA?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two types of cases that fall within the Board's jurisdiction under USERRA. The first type is a reemployment case, in which an appellant claims that a federal agency has failed to comply with its obligations to reemploy the appellant after he or she has completed a period of military service. The second type is a "discrimination" case, in which an appellant claims that a federal agency has denied the appellant initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any "benefit of employment" on the basis of the appellant's military service. <span class="Italic">Clavin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). In addition, the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate USERRA reprisal claims, that is, claims that an agency has discriminated or taken an adverse employment action against an appellant in reprisal for: (1) an action to enforce a right under USERRA; (2) the provision of testimony or a statement in a prior USERRA proceeding; (3) participation or assistance in investigating a USERRA claim; or (4) the exercise of a right under USERRA. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 (b).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA defines the phrase "benefit of employment" broadly as "any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest (other than wages or salary for work performed) that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice, and includes rights and benefits under a pension plan, a health plan, an employee stock ownership plan, insurance coverage and awards, bonuses, severance pay, supplemental unemployment benefits, vacations, and the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">How do I file a USERRA appeal with the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A person who claims that a federal agency has failed or refused to comply with the provisions of USERRA with respect to the employment or reemployment of such person may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, who will investigate the complaint and attempt to resolve it if the Secretary's investigation reveals that the agency committed a USERRA violation. The Department of Labor website describes how to file a USERRA complaint: <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/userra">https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/userra</a>. If she is unable to resolve the complaint, the Secretary must provide written notification to the complainant, who may then file a USERRA appeal with the Board or request that the Secretary refer the complaint to the Office of Special Counsel. If a complaint is referred, and the Special Counsel is reasonably satisfied that the complainant is entitled to the benefit sought, the Special Counsel may initiate an action and act as the complainant's attorney before the Board. If the Special Counsel declines to initiate an action on the complainant's behalf, the complainant may file an appeal with the Board. A person may also elect to file a USERRA claim directly with the Board if he or she decides not to seek the assistance of the Secretary of Labor and the Office of Special Counsel. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324 (a), (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">What is the time limit for filing a USERRA appeal with the Board?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike most appeals, there is no time limit for filing a USERRA appeal with the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.12. However, the Board encourages appellants to file USERRA appeals as soon as possible after the alleged violation occurs or after the appellant receives notice that the Secretary of Labor has been unable to resolve a complaint or that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to initiate an action on the appellant's behalf. Furthermore, while there is no time limit to file a USERRA appeal, the Board can enforce only those rights that existed under USERRA and its <span id="Page_448"></span>predecessor statute (the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974) at the time the claim accrued. <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Department of the Army</span>, 234 F.3d 553, 556-57 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Which party has the burden of proof in a USERRA appeal?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a reemployment case, the agency bears the burden of proving that it met its obligations to reemploy the appellant after a period of military service. <span class="Italic">Clavin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). In discrimination and reprisal cases, the appellant must initially prove that his or her military status or prior USERRA activity was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action, and, if the appellant meets this burden, the agency must then prove that it would have taken the action for a valid reason despite the appellant's protected status. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 (c)(1), (2); <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">If I win my appeal, what relief will the Board provide?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board determines that an agency has not complied with USERRA with respect to the employment or reemployment of the appellant, the Board will enter an order requiring the agency to comply with the provisions it violated and to compensate the appellant for any loss of wages or benefits the appellant suffered as a result of the agency's violation. In addition, if the Board issues an order in the appellant's favor, it has the discretion to award the appellant reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324 (c).</p>

Liability is established under the statute if military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the challenged discriminatory conduct:</p>

USERRA, among other provisions, protects veterans against discrimination in their employment on account of their prior military service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA sets forth remedial procedures for employees of executive agencies. 38 U.S.C. 4322 and 4324. USERRA first provides that the Secretary may provide assistance to any person with respect to the rights and benefits to which that person is entitled under USERRA. 38 U.S.C. 4321. Further, a person who claims that a Federal executive agency[5] has failed or refused to comply with, or is about to fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of USERRA may file a complaint with the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. 4322(a). USERRA provides for the Secretary to investigate the complaint, and if he determines that the action alleged in the complaint occurred, he is to make reasonable efforts to resolve the complaint. 38 U.S.C. 4322(d). If unable to resolve the complaint, the Secretary is required to notify the person who submitted the complaint of the complainant's right to proceed further. 38 U.S.C. 4322(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;38 U.S.C. 4303(5) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The term "Federal executive agency" includes the United States Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, any nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States, any Executive agency (as that term is defined in section 105 of title 5) other than an agency referred to in section 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii) of title 5, and any military department (as that term is defined in section 102 of title 5) with respect to the civilian employees of that department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who receives notification under section 4322(e) may request that the Secretary refer the complaint for litigation before the Board by referring it to the Special Counsel. 38 U.S.C. 4324(a). If the Special Counsel is "reasonably satisfied" that the individual is entitled to the rights and benefits sought, the Special Counsel may, if requested by the individual submitting the complaint, "appear on behalf of, and act as attorney for, the person and initiate an action" before the Board. 38 U.S.C. 4324(a)(2)(A). An individual may also submit a complaint against a Federal executive agency directly with the Board under circumstances delineated by 38 U.S.C. 4324(b).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Section 4324(b) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person may submit a complaint against a Federal executive agency under this subchapter directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board if that person--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;has chosen not to apply to the Secretary for assistance regarding a complaint under section 4322(c);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;has received a notification from the Secretary under section 4322(e);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;has chosen not to be represented before the Board by the Special Counsel pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(A); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;has received a notification of a decision from the Special Counsel under subsection (a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial filing with the Board, the appellant alleged that he filed a complaint with the Secretary on June 23, 1995, and that on July 5, 1995, the appellant was advised that the Department of Labor would not handle his complaint because he was represented by counsel. There is no factual support in the record for this unsworn allegation by counsel and the record does not contain a copy of the purported complaint filed with the Secretary or of the Secretary's alleged denial of assistance. Nevertheless, these non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction are not contested by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon return of the case, the administrative judge must determine whether the appellant sought the assistance of the Secretary by filing a complaint within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. 4322. If he did so, and received a letter from the Secretary meeting the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 4322(e), he has properly exhausted his administrative remedies. If the appellant did not file a complaint, or if the Department of Labor declined to accept the complaint because the appellant was represented by an attorney, he is entitled to file a complaint directly with the Board under 38 U.S.C. 4324(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether this case falls within the Board's original or appellate jurisdiction is among the issues the administrative judge raised in the Order certifying this matter for interlocutory appeal. Although many of the enforcement procedures of USERRA bear some resemblance to the procedures in the Board's original jurisdiction cases arising under the WPA, both the language and the legislative history of USERRA make it evident that all cases under USERRA brought by individual appellants fall within the Board's appellate jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the agency removed his law enforcement commission and that it subjected him to a hostile work environment, both because of his prior military service. The administrative judge found that the former allegation was sufficient to give the Board jurisdiction over the complaint, but that the latter was not. We agree as to the first finding, but disagree as to the second.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first finding addressed the appellant's contentions relating to the removal of his law enforcement commission. In May 1995, when the agency informed the appellant that it was removing his law enforcement commission, it offered him a reassignment to a dispatcher position in its Enforcement Division. Although the record is not clear on this point, it appears that the law enforcement commission is the designation that allows an individual to serve in a law enforcement position in the agency. The appellant alleges that as a result of the removal of the commission, his weapon was removed, his duties and responsibilities were changed, and he did not receive a promotion to GS-9 that he otherwise would have received had he remained in a law enforcement position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to his allegations of harassment, the appellant contended that "[d]uring the application process and since the time of his hire, supervisors and co-workers have made negative comments about [his] status as a disabled veteran." He asserts that a supervisor informed him that the agency was forced to hire him because he was a disabled veteran. The appellant further alleged that he and other veterans were belittled by agency workers, that he was called various derogatory names, such as "psycho," "baby killer," and "plate head," and that he complained to the agency personnel office, but that no effective steps were taken to end the hostile conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated previously, the administrative judge found that the Board had jurisdiction regarding only the allegations relating to the commission. We agree with the administrative judge on this point, but also find that the appellant's allegations of harassment are sufficient to provide the Board with jurisdiction. In reaching this conclusion, we begin, as did the administrative judge, with the language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. OPM</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 380, 383 (1994). One of the basic purposes of USERRA is "to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services." 38 U.S.C. 4301(a)(3). Congress also expressed its intent "that the Federal Government should be a model employer in carrying out the provisions of [USERRA]." 38 U.S.C. 4301(b). USERRA specifically prohibits an employer from denying "any benefit of employment" on account of prior service in the uniformed services. 38 U.S.C. 4311(a). "Benefit of employment" is broadly defined to include "any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest (other than wages or salary for work performed) that accrues by reason of...an employer policy, plan, or practice...." 38 U.S.C. 4303(2). The legislative history of this section reaffirms that an expansive interpretation was intended....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_449"></span>The appellant's law enforcement commission, under the facts as alleged, falls well within USERRA's definition of "benefit of employment." The commission reflects the status of a Federal law enforcement officer and it accrues by virtue of the agency's policies and practices. According to the appellant's allegations, his law enforcement commission affects his job assignments and his ability to carry a weapon. Both of these incidents of employment come within the broad ambit of "advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest" and thus are benefits within the meaning of USERRA. In addition, the term "benefit" specifically includes "rights and benefits under a pension plan." The appellant's law enforcement status directly affects his entitlement to enhanced benefits under the Federal Employees' Retirement System. 5 U.S.C. 8336(c)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the removal of the commission affecting the appellant's benefits of employment as related above, the withdrawal of the commission could have worked to deprive the appellant of his promotion to the GS-9 level. The appellant alleged that he would have received a promotion to GS-9, but for the withdrawal of his commission. Section 4311(a), 38 U.S.C., specifically prohibits the denial of a promotion because of past military service. Of course, the appellant's mere allegation that he was deprived of promotional opportunities is not sufficient in itself. Instead, he must show that some provision of law mandated a promotion or that he otherwise would, in fact, have obtained a promotion had he not lost his law enforcement commission. <span class="Italic">See Boese v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Education</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 406, 411 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's hostile environment claim does not clearly fall within the term "benefit," we are persuaded that an "expansive interpretation" of that term, as intended by Congress, leads to the conclusion that it does. We note that the courts have consistently construed anti-discrimination statutes as proscribing harassment in the workplace....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' burdens of proof in a discrimination claim under USERRA are set forth in 38 U.S.C. 4311(b), as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer shall be considered to have denied a person...a benefit of employment in violation of this section if the person's...service...is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such...performance of service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In explaining the meaning of this provision, Congressman Montgomery, the Chairman of the House Committee, stated that the provision reaffirmed that the standard of proof "is the so-called but for test and that the burden of proof is on the employer, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established." 140 Cong. Rec. H9133 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1994)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4311(b) would reaffirm that the standard of proof in a discrimination or retaliation case is the so-called "but for" test and that the burden of proof is on the employer, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This standard and burden of proof is applicable to all cases brought under this section regardless of the date of accrual of the cause of action. To the extent that courts have relied on dicta from the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Standard Oil Co.</span>, 452 U.S. 549, 559[101 S. Ct. 2510, 2516, 69 L. Ed.2d 226 (1981), that a violation of this section can occur only if the military obligation is the sole factor (<span class="Italic">see Sawyer v. Swift &#x0026; Co.</span>, 836 F.2d 1257, 1261 (10th Cir. 1988)), those decisions have misinterpreted the original legislative intent and history of 38 U.S.C. 2021(b)(3) and are rejected on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress clearly rejected the concept that prior military service must be the sole factor motivating an employer's alleged discriminatory conduct. Instead, the appellant must only show, by preponderant evidence, that the prior service was "a substantial or a motivating factor." <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Transportation Management Corp.</span>, 462 U.S. 393, 400, 103 S. Ct. 2469, 2473, 76 L. Ed.2d 667 (1983). If the appellant meets that burden, he is entitled to prevail, unless the agency is able to show that it would have taken the same action "even if, hypothetically, [it] had not been motivated by a desire to punish" the appellant because of the prior military service<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 403, 103 S. Ct. at 2475. In <span class="Italic">Transportation Management</span>, 462 U.S. at 403, 103 S. Ct. at 2475, the Court noted that the allocation of proof is analogous to that previously adopted by the Court in <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977). Thus, the appellant need only show that his prior military service was a "motivating factor" which under <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy</span> is the same as a substantial factor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 287, 97 S. Ct. at 576.</p>
