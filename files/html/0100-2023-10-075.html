<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-75"><span class="space">a.</span> Videoconference, Telephone Hearing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Now standard practice (through a Zoom platform) as a result of the Covid pandemic starting in early 2020, in 2005 the Board first blessed videoconference hearings, even over a party's objection. The Board balanced the quality and intensity of a "live" personal hearing and financial considerations. Money talked, <span class="Italic">Koehler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 99 MSPR 82, 84-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-14 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), an appellant who was subjected to an action that is appealable to the Board has "the right...to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept...." <span id="Page_1368"></span>When the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was passed, a "hearing" meant only one thing, that the appellant, with his representative, if any, and his witnesses, would, along with the agency representative and his witnesses, and the presiding official, convene in a room where testimony would be taken, transcribed by a court reporter. In other words, all Board hearings were conducted in person; no other type of hearing was envisioned. Over the years, under certain circumstances, especially where there were issues as to the inconvenience and expense of travel, the Board decided that appellants should be offered the option of having their hearings conducted telephonically. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, Sincero v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 239, 243 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also Brumley v. Department of Transportation</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 666, 678-79 (1991), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Hasler v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 415, 419-20 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 112 (1994), the Board considered the case of an appellant whose request for an in-person hearing was denied by the AJ who, over the appellant's objection, conducted the hearing by telephone. The Board held that, with certain limitations, an "appellant is entitled to an in-person hearing," and although she might avail herself of the opportunity for a telephone hearing in lieu of an in-person hearing, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 115, an AJ may not order a telephone hearing over the appellant's objection. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 116. The Board did not hold that remand was automatically necessary when an AJ improperly held a telephonic hearing, but that, instead, the Board would undertake a careful scrutiny of the record to determine whether the AJ's error had a potential adverse effect on the appellant's substantive rights. The Board found that the denial of an in-person hearing in the <span class="Italic">McGrath</span> case potentially harmed the appellant in the presentation of her case, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 117, and so remanded the case with instructions to the AJ to schedule the in-person hearing to which the appellant was entitled. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 118. In a subsequent case, <span class="Italic">Lowe v. Department of Defense</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 97 (1995), after scrutinizing the record in that case, the Board could not find that the AJ's error in improperly holding a telephone hearing had a potential adverse effect on the appellant's substantive rights and so, found it unnecessary to remand the appeal for the AJ to hold an in-person hearing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 100-01.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the ensuing years, and as technology developed, the Board offered the option of videoconference hearings so that an appellant at a remote location could avail himself of a hearing without undertaking the expense and inconvenience of having to travel to a designated hearing site. <span class="Italic">Siman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 306 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (<span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who explained to AJ that he could not afford the expense of traveling to the hearing should have been advised of the options of having a telephone or video conference hearing). In <span class="Italic">Perez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 168 (2000), the Board considered the case of an appellant whose request for an in-person jurisdictional hearing was denied by the AJ who, over the appellant's objection, convened the hearing by videoconference. Because of allegations that there were technical difficulties with the videoconference equipment which might have interfered with the AJ's ability to observe the demeanor of some of the witnesses, and because there were serious questions of witness credibility going to the central disputed fact in the case, the Board found it necessary, under the particular facts presented, to remand the appeal for an in-person hearing. <span class="Italic">Perez</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 168 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 7-8; <span class="Italic">see also Vicente v. Department of the Army</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2000) (appeal in which hearing was conducted by videoconference would be remanded so that a portion of the hearing could be held in-person where there were serious questions of credibility going to the central disputed facts in the case which the AJ might have resolved differently had she held that portion of the hearing in-person). In neither of those cases did the Board find it necessary to address the issue of whether a videoconference hearing without technical difficulties would satisfy the appellant's right to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crickard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 625 &#x00B6; 25 (2002), the Board did address that issue, holding that, when an appellant in an appeal requiring the AJ to make credibility determinations requests an in-person hearing, that request may not be denied in favor of a videoconference hearing in the absence of a showing of good cause. Finding that the record revealed no reason at all for the denial, and no consideration by the AJ of factors and concerns such as those posed by Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 43(a),[2] the Board remanded the appeal for the in-person hearing to which it deemed the appellant was entitled. However, the Board found it unnecessary to, and did not, determine what circumstances might justify an AJ's holding a videoconference hearing over an appellant's objection. <span class="Italic">Crickard</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 625 &#x00B6; 27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board looked for guidance to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 43(a), which was amended in 1966 to authorize courts to permit testimony "by contemporaneous transmission from a different location." The authority was to be exercised only "for good cause shown in compelling circumstances and upon appropriate safeguards...." Fed.R.Civ.P. 43(a). The accompanying advisory committee note indicated that such circumstances could be shown by evidence that a witness had become unavailable to attend the trial because of unexpected circumstances such as accident or illness, particularly where there was a risk that, by the time the witness was able to testify, other witnesses would become unavailable. <span class="Italic">Crickard</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 625 &#x00B6; 24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These latter cases grew out of, and rest on, the premise, first announced in <span class="Italic">McGrath</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 115, that an appellant is "entitled" to an in-person hearing of the type routinely convened following the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. In making that pronouncement, however, the Board in <span class="Italic">McGrath</span> cited statutory authority for an appellant's right to a hearing, not his right to an in-person hearing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In fact, there is no statutory mandate for an unlimited entitlement to an in-person hearing. An unlimited right to such a hearing not only infringes on judicial efficiency, economy, and discretion, but unduly expands the statutory "right" of appellants. As noted, an appellant has "the right...to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1). A videoconference hearing is such a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not unlike the rest of the federal government, the Board is facing serious challenges to work harder and faster, and to decide cases more efficiently. We cannot ignore the existence of videoconference technology if we are to meet these challenges. Almost daily advances in this field have succeeded in removing many of the limitations formerly associated with this type of proceeding. Videoconference hearings provide a less costly alternative to affording every appellant an in-person hearing, particularly in the absence of statutory authority for such a "right," and where the alternative does not detract from an appellant's right to "appear before" an AJ. <span class="Italic">Bommer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 543, 549 (1987) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) requires an oral hearing before an administrative judge, even when material facts are not in dispute).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that there are cases in which courts have expressed concerns over the technology of videoconference hearings. For example, in interpreting the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which applies to defendants in criminal cases, courts have been reluctant to approve arrangements whereby defendants or witnesses were not permitted to be present in person at hearings. <span class="Italic">Maryland v. Craig</span>, 497 U.S. 836, 850, 110 S. Ct. 3157, 111 L. Ed.2d 666 (1990) (the right to face-to-face confrontation during such proceedings is not absolute, but can be denied only when denial of such confrontation is necessary to further an important public policy and only where the reliability of the testimony is otherwise assured). Concerns that might be present in these types of cases, however, where an individual's life or liberty is at stake, are simply not present in Board cases and, therefore, do not compel the same result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore hold today that, in conjunction with the broad discretion afforded them to control proceedings at which they officiate, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b), AJs may hold videoconference hearings in any case, regardless of whether the appellant objects.[3] To the extent that <span class="Italic">Crickard</span> and other such cases hold that, in an appeal where the AJ is required to make credibility determinations, he may not convene a videoconference hearing over the appellant's objection in the absence of a showing of good cause, those cases are hereby overruled.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Because this case involves a videoconference hearing, we need not, nor do we, extend this holding to telephone hearings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We acknowledge that the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, Chapter 10, &#x00A7; 6, provides guidance on the subject of videoconference hearings that relies on <span class="Italic">Crickard</span> and other related cases which we have today overruled. As such, that guidance no longer reflects the current state of the Board's law on this issue. The Handbook is not an independent source of authority for AJs and creates no greater substantive rights for appellants than that to which they are entitled by law, rule, or regulation, as developed through the Board's own current case law and that of our reviewing court, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Handbook, Chapter 1, &#x00A7; 1 ("This handbook is designed to provide supplemental guidance to the Board's regulations. The procedures in this handbook are not mandatory, and adjudicatory error is not established solely by failure to comply with a provision of this handbook."). Based on this announced change in policy, the Board will undertake to revise Chapter 10, &#x00A7; 6 of the Handbook to comport with this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AJs remain bound, of course, to ensure a fair and just adjudication in every case, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(5)(iii), and an appellant who believes that his rights have been prejudiced by the AJ's having conducted a videoconference hearing may, after duly noting his objection, ask the Board to review whether the AJ abused his discretion in this regard. The Board can and will review such claims on a case-by-case basis. In the instant case, the appellant suggests that the AJ was not watching her when she testified, arguing that he was out of camera range for a brief time. Even if true, the fact that the appellant could not see the AJ for a brief period of time does not mean that he failed to observe her. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has not shown, by her <span id="Page_1369"></span>claim, that the AJ denied her a fair and just adjudication by conducting this hearing as a videoconference hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 254 Fed. Appx. 814, 818 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), determined videoconference hearings to be unobjectionable "absent a showing that it resulted in specific unfairness in a particular case," the opinion adding "as to the witness who apparently testified by telephone, Mr. Burroughs has not made any showing that he was prejudiced by the administrative judge's decision to proceed in that manner with respect to that witness, who was otherwise unavailable." <span class="Italic">Toyama v. Leavitt</span>, 408 Fed. Appx. 351, 353 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Toyama alleges that the administrative judge made various procedural errors, including using video conferencing rather than transferring the hearing to Atlanta and recording the hearing rather than making a written transcript. These actions do not rise to an abuse of discretion. The Board has broad discretion as to how hearings are conducted, and the Board previously has approved of using video conferencing. <span class="Italic">Koehler v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 82 (2005). Given the administrative judges' heavy caseload and the fact that they are often stationed long distances from employment sites and places that are convenient to parties and witnesses, the use of video conferencing is acceptable absent a showing of specific unfairness in a particular case. While Ms. Toyama argues generally that the video conference format "harmfully compromised" her ability to confront and cross examine witnesses, she has not shown that the video conferencing caused particular unfairness.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS,</span> PH-0752-11-0254-I-1 (NP 3/29/2012), dismissed assertions that the videoconference hearing did not permit the AJ to assess witness credibility:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the hearing, which was conducted by video conference, was not fair because the administrative judge was unable to assess the witnesses' demeanor, and that not having her in the same room as the witnesses violated his right to due process. However, there is no statutory mandate for an unlimited entitlement to an in-person hearing before the Board; rather, an appellant has "the right...to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(2). The Board has determined that, in conjunction with the broad discretion afforded them to control proceedings at which they officiate, administrative judges may hold videoconference hearings in any case, regardless of whether the appellant objects. <span class="Italic">Koehler v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6; 13 (2005).

The Board has cautioned, however, that administrative judges remain bound to ensure a fair and just adjudication in every case, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(5)(iii), and that an appellant who believes that his rights have been prejudiced by the administrative judge's having conducted a videoconference hearing may, after duly noting his objection, ask the Board to review whether the administrative judge abused his discretion in this regard. <span class="Italic">Koehler</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge advised the parties 7 weeks in advance that the requested hearing would be held by video conference, that she and the court reporter would be in Philadelphia, and that all other participants would be at the Board's fixed hearing site in Baltimore. Although the appellant did not object, he now argues that his attorney could not clearly see the administrative judge's face, and that therefore it is "hard to believe" that she could clearly see the faces of the two complaining witnesses. However, the administrative judge specifically stated in the initial decision that she "carefully watched" those two witnesses during their testimony and that she was able to observe their demeanor. Under these circumstances, the appellant has not shown, by his claim, that the administrative judge denied him a fair hearing and just adjudication by conducting the hearing as a videoconference hearing. <span class="Italic">Koehler</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6; 14.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Koehler</span> was limited to videoconference hearings. As a result of provisions of the statute establishing the Department of Homeland Security Personnel System, the Board's regulations permitted both videoconference and telephonic hearings for appeals from employees covered by that system. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1210.19 (2008). However, on March 4, 2009, through notice in 74 Fed. Reg. 9343, the Board removed DHS-specific regulations because:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective October 1, 2008, the DHS rescinded application of 5 CFR 9701, Subparts A-G, of the DHS Human Resources Management System. 73 FR 58435. DHS took this action pursuant to the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009, Public Law 110-329 (2008) (the "FY 09 DHS Appropriations Act"), which barred DHS from using funds appropriated in this act or any other appropriations act for the development, testing, deployment, or operation of any portion of the DHS personnel system.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Law issued before <span class="Italic">Koehler</span> ordinarily precludes a telephonic hearing from being imposed on an appellant. After some years of considering circumstances of individual hearings conducted by telephone or videoconference--a process that reduced travel expenses for the Board, agencies, and appellants--the Board decided in <span class="Italic">Crickard v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CRICKARD_WESLEY_DC_0752_01_0282_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249332.pdf">92 MSPR 625</a>, 634-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-27 (2002), that "when an appellant in an appeal requiring the administrative judge to make credibility determinations requests an in-person hearing, that request may not be denied in the absence of a showing of good cause." The Board did not, however, define "good cause":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), an appellant in an appeal filed with the Board has "the right...to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept...." Neither the Board's regulations nor any statutory provisions expressly provide that hearings in which the participants view each other only through videoconferencing do or do not satisfy the appellant's right to a hearing. Moreover, although the Board has vacated initial decisions in cases in which videoconference hearings were held, and has ordered the holding of in-person hearings in those cases, it has done so based on evidence that technical difficulties prevented the administrative judges from observing the demeanor of witnesses who testified at the hearings. <span class="Italic">Vicente v. Department of the Army</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 80 &#x00B6; 8 (2000); <span class="Italic">Perez v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 168 &#x00B6; 7 (2000). In those cases, the Board has expressly declined to address the issue of whether a videoconference hearing without such difficulties satisfies the appellant's right to a hearing<span class="Italic">. Vicente</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 80 &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Perez</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 168 &#x00B6; 5. Because the hearing in the present appeal has not been shown to have been affected by any significant technical difficulties, we must address that issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To address that issue, we look for guidance to Rule 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which was amended in 1996 to authorize courts to permit testimony "by contemporaneous transmission from a different location." This authority, however, is to be exercised only "for good cause shown in compelling circumstances and upon appropriate safeguards...." Fed.R.Civ.P. 43(a). Moreover, the advisory committee note regarding this change includes the following statements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The importance of presenting live testimony in court cannot be forgotten. The very ceremony of trial and the presence of the factfinder may exert a powerful force for truthtelling. The opportunity to judge the demeanor of a witness face-to-face is accorded great value in our tradition. Transmission cannot be justified merely by showing that it is inconvenient for the witness to attend the trial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fed R. Civ. P. 43 advisory committee's note. The note also indicates that good cause and compelling circumstances may be shown by evidence that a witness has become unable to attend the trial because of unexpected circumstances such as accident or illness, particularly when there is a risk that, by the time the witness is able to testify, other witnesses will become unavailable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Other possible justifications for remote transmission," however, "must be approached cautiously," according to the advisory committee note. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it may look to those rules for guidance. <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Office</span> <span class="Italic">of Personnel Management,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 44, 47 (1997). The provision of Rule 43(a) that is quoted above <span id="Page_1370"></span>is helpful in our review of the issue addressed here because the subject of that rule--i.e., the conduct of a civil trial--has a central purpose that is essentially the same as one of the central purposes of a Board hearing, which is the promotion of accuracy in factfinding. Moreover, as we have indicated above, an in-person hearing, like an in-person trial, offers important advantages in eliciting truthful testimony and in enabling the fact-finder to make accurate credibility determinations. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Vicente</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 80 &#x00B6; 8, and <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 168 &#x00B6; 7, demeanor aspects other than facial expressions (including sweating, hand gestures, and the focus of the witnesses' attention on direct and cross-examination) may not be adequately communicated or observed over a video monitor. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Larson v. Department of the Army,</span> 260 F.3d 1350, 1356 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (in addressing the deference to be given an administrative judge's credibility determinations, the court noted that the administrative judge's observations of the witnesses during the hearing were "somewhat limited," since the hearing was conducted by telephone).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;While there is some recent case law regarding the hearing rights of aliens seeking asylum, that case law is of little help here. Congress enacted legislation in 1996 providing expressly that such hearings could be conducted "by telephonic or video connection." Pub.L. No. 104-208, &#x00A7; 302(a), 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-581, <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III); <span class="Italic">see United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Paredes Batista,</span> 140 F.3d 367, 377 n.13 (2d Cir. 1998). As noted above, no such express provision applies to Board hearings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that, when an appellant in an appeal requiring the administrative judge to make credibility determinations requests an in-person hearing, that request may not be denied in the absence of a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine here what circumstances might justify an administrative judge's holding a video-hearing over an appellant's objection. When the record reveals no reason at all for the denial, however, and no consideration by the administrative judge of factors and concerns such as those posed by Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 43(a), and when there are material factual disputes whose resolution requires credibility determinations, the denial is clearly improper. Those circumstances were present in this appeal. We therefore find that the administrative judge erred in denying the appellant's request for an in-person hearing....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board rejection of telephonic hearings to resolve material points involving credibility disputes was reaffirmed, <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 113 MSPR 16, 19-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15, 2009 MSPB 229 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in permitting two agency witnesses, Amanda Craycraft and Ashley Craycraft, to testify by telephone, rather than in person, over the appellant's objection. As noted by the appellant, the Craycraft sisters accompanied the locksmith to Ms. Formby's home on April 18, 2008, and thus witnessed the appellant's interactions with Ms. Formby on that date. The appellant specifically asserts that only the Craycraft sisters testified that he told Ms. Formby he would knock her door down, while he maintains that he told her that if she did not open the door the police would knock it down. He further asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding their testimony credible since they both testified that the garage door was closed when they arrived at Ms. Formby's residence, while the locksmith and the appellant testified that it was open.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), an appellant has a right to a hearing at which the administrative judge may observe the testimony of witnesses. <span class="Italic">See McCurdy v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 5 (2004). In <span class="Italic">Koehler v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13 (2005), the Board held that an administrative judge could satisfy that right by holding a videoconference hearing, even when the appellant objected to such an arrangement. It also indicated, however, that, because that case involved a videoconference hearing, and not a telephonic hearing, it did not need to, nor would it, extend its holding to telephonic hearings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 13 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In stating its holding in <span class="Italic">Koehler,</span> the Board in effect relied on an administrative judge's opportunity, during a videoconference hearing, to visually observe witnesses as they testified. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13 (reference to "advances [that] have succeeded in removing many of the limitations formerly associated with" videoconference hearings). This opportunity is critical to an administrative judge's ability to make the demeanor-based credibility determinations whose importance has been emphasized by our reviewing court. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so). Moreover, the Board has held that a videoconference hearing in which technical or other difficulties might have interfered with the administrative judge's ability to observe the demeanor of some witnesses does not satisfy an appellant's right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Vicente v. Department of the Army,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2000); <span class="Italic">Perez v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 7-8 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge's opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses while they are testifying over the telephone would appear to be far more limited than it would be if those witnesses testified before properly functioning videoconference equipment. In fact, the opportunity of the administrative judge in the present appeal to observe the Craycraft sisters' demeanor while testifying over the telephone would appear to have been even more limited than in cases, cited above, where the Board remanded the appeals based on difficulties arising during videoconference proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Vicente,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (appeal remanded based on the appellant's assertion that technical difficulties had interrupted the proceedings); <span class="Italic">Perez</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9 (appeal remanded based on evidence that the administrative judge did not have a full view of witnesses' faces).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge erred in ordering a partial telephonic hearing. Where an administrative judge improperly holds a telephonic hearing, the Board will undertake a careful review of the record to determine whether the error had a potential adverse effect on the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Lowe v. Department of Defense,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 97, 99-101 (1995); <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Department of Defense,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 112, 116 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the record demonstrates that the Craycraft sisters testified regarding disputed factual matters. Most notably, they testified that the appellant told Ms. Formby he was going to knock her door down if she did not come out of her home. The appellant testified that he told Ms. Formby that the police would knock her door down if she did not open it. The administrative judge explicitly found credible the testimony that the appellant threatened to knock down Ms. Formby's door. Although she had no opportunity to view the witnesses' demeanor, she found the Craycraft sisters credible simply because "they directly observed the appellant's interactions with [Ms.] Formby" and because they lacked bias concerning the events of April 18, 2008. The administrative judge then relied on their testimony to sustain specification two of the abuse of authority charge, part of which specifically alleged that the appellant "threatened to knock [Ms. Formby's] door down if she did not come out."

If a party to a telephonic hearing is to prevail on the basis of a procedural objection during the appeal, assuming no credibility issues, there would have to be some potentially adverse effect on the ability of the party to have evidence fairly considered. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jhin v.

<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Koehler</span> and <span class="Italic">Crickard</span>, it was considered that although a telephonic hearing may limit an AJ's ability to observe witnesses, <span class="Italic">Larson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 91 MSPR 511, 515 &#x00B6; 12 (2002), AJs had authority to conduct telephonic or videoconference hearings. But a hearing was considered of such importance that the Board would closely scrutinize efforts by the AJ to limit it by insisting on a telephonic rather than an in-person hearing. The Board modified its harmful error rule as it remanded a case for an in-person hearing when there was a possibility, but no demonstration, of harm to the appellant through a telephonic hearing. <span class="Italic">McGrath v. DOD</span>, 64 MSPR 112, 114-18 (1994) ("The Board has recognized that an appellant's right to a hearing provides more than just an opportunity to testify; it provides an opportunity to observe the proceedings and provide guidance to her representative. <span class="Italic">Starkey v.

Further, the appellant informed the administrative judge during the hearing that she and her representative had to use separate telephones. It is likely, therefore, that the appellant was not able to provide the kind of guidance to her representative that she would have been able to provide had she and her representative been seated together at an in-person hearing."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lowe v.

<p class="Body-Text">The use of videoconference hearings, although not banned outright, was heartily challenged in <span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PEREZ_RAY_A_DC_0752_98_0846_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248409.pdf">86 MSPR 168</a>, 170-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2000). The appellant twice objected to the use of a videoconference hearing prior to the hearing. There was a credibility issue involving whether the appellant was told he could resign prior to a RIF and still maintain his Board appeal right. The Board remanded the case for an "in-person hearing":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed an affidavit on petition for review in which he states that he watched the monitor during the hearing that showed what the administrative judge could see, and that the "view the Judge had throughout the hearing was primarily the back of witnesses' heads and sometimes a profile view."[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency's representative states in the agency's response to the petition for review that the agency does not agree with the appellant's description of the hearing. However, a statement of a party's representative in a pleading is not evidence. <span class="Italic">Hendricks v. Department of the Navy,</span> 69 MSPR 163, 168 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no videotape record to contradict the appellant's account. In the initial decision the administrative judge did not credit the appellant's testimony that he was told he could appeal the RIF even if he resigned, and credited the testimony of the witnesses who denied giving the appellant incorrect information about his appeal rights. However, there is no way for us to say that if the administrative judge had had a full view of the witnesses he would not have arrived at different credibility determinations based on their demeanor. In addition, apart from the witnesses' faces, there may have been other demeanor aspects of the witnesses (e.g., sweating; hand gestures; where their attention was directed on direct and cross-examination) that were not captured on the video monitor but which the administrative judge could assess in an in-person hearing. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Depart</span>ment <span class="Italic">of the</span> Army, 35 MSPR 453, 462 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by the agency's argument that the administrative judge's credibility determinations can be upheld on the ground that the testimony which was credited was corroborated by affidavits. Corroboration of testimony based on other evidence in the record may lend credibility to testimony, but witness demeanor is also a factor to be considered in assessing credibility. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 35 MSPR at 458. The agency in essence contends that witness demeanor is immaterial in this case, but this argument is circular, inasmuch as it assumes that a <span id="Page_1372"></span>demeanor assessment would not have made any difference to support the conclusion that a demeanor assessment was unnecessary. The administrative judge could have reasonably made credibility findings contrary to the ones he did make based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, witness demeanor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perez</span> noted the Board could not itself review the video of the hearing, because the Board maintains only a transcript, not a videotape, of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vicente v. Dept. of Army</span>, 87 MSPR 80, 83 &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (remanding for a hearing to receive in-person rather than video testimony of an employee who complained of sexual misconduct by the appellant; objection was made to the video hearing of her evidence; technical difficulties with the video hearing may have interfered with the AJ's ability to assess the demeanor of the witness).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Videoconferencing and teleconferencing present a degree of cost shifting because agencies may be required to supply facilities or pay for telephone charges necessary to the hearing process. The matter of shared costs has spawned two advisory memos within the Board. In 1994, the opinion provided to the Board was that agency payments toward videoconferencing expenses, estimated at $30 per hour, were <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and did not constitute an unlawful augmentation of the Board's budgetary appropriation. No conflict of interest or apparent conflict was considered to result from partial payment by an agency of administrative expenses associated with a videoconference. Agencies had long been called upon, as necessary, to supply hearing rooms to the Board. [Memo of 11/1/94 from General Counsel to MSPB Chairman.] In 1997, further internal guidance on the subject suggested that agencies did not unlawfully augment the Board's appropriation through participation in videoconferencing because the associated costs were a replacement for the costs the agencies would incur in transporting necessary witnesses to a distant hearing side. [Memo of 7/15/97 from General Counsel, MSPB Automation Committee.] [Refer to treatment of videoconferences in the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, Chapters 4, 9, and 10, discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-10-014.html#sec3-14">Failure to Request Hearing</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-10-056.html#sec3-56">Prehearing Conference</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-10-148.html#sec3-148">Control of Questioning</a>."]</p>
