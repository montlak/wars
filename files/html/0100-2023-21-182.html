<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-181"><span class="space">18.</span> Individual Retirement Record</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">It was long the Board's practice not to involve itself in disputes over the accuracy of agency individual retirement records for employees that show when individuals were employed. But as result of <span class="Italic">Lisanti v. OPM,</span> 573 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2009), matters changed and now, according to <span class="Italic">Denney v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 269, 274-75 n.4, 2012 MSPB 9 (2012), the accuracy of an IRR can be challenged through a retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lisanti,</span> the court modified prior Board decisions holding or implying that OPM and the Board are bound by the employing agency's IRR and that an appellant's remedy for a claim that the IRR is erroneous lies with seeking an amended IRR from the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Lee v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 7 (2008); <span class="Italic">Rainone v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 579 (2006). The court specifically rejected OPM's reliance on these decisions, finding that the IRR is not necessarily binding, and that, absent a clear Congressional intent to the contrary, both OPM and the Board are required to "entertain" a challenge to the employing agency's interpretation of the term "basic pay" on the IRR.<span class="Italic"> Lisanti,</span> 573 F.3d at 1239-40.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lisanti v. OPM</span>, 573 F.3d 1334, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2009), decided that OPM had authority to review a court reporter's "basic pay" and was not required to rely on the records of his employing agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Lisanti that OPM had authority to determine Lisanti's basic pay and that the Board also had the authority to review OPM's reliance on the Administrative Office's determination. Although the employing agency, the Administrative Office in this case, must certify an employee's basic pay in his individual retirement record, OPM is required under the CSRS to review the employing agency's legal determination of which categories of income qualify as basic pay....&#8197;Thus, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(b), OPM "shall adjudicate all claims under" the CSRS. Such claims require the interpretation of the term "basic pay," which falls under the CSRS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(3) (defining "basic pay" under the CSRS). OPM was therefore required to review the Administrative Office's interpretation of the term "basic pay," which excluded transcript income from Lisanti's basic pay. The Board was similarly required to review OPM's interpretation of "basic pay," as Congress directed that OPM's actions that affect "the rights or interests of an individual" may be appealed to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gunter v. OPM,</span> CH-0831-11-0435-I-1 (NP 4/27/2012), commented on <span class="Italic">Lisanti:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserts that it must follow the IRR transmitted to it by the Postal Service and that the appellant's remedy is to seek a correction of the IRR from the Postal Service. However, OPM is not bound by the IRR under all circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Lisanti v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 573 F.3d 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the court modified prior Board decisions holding or implying that OPM and the Board are bound by the employing agency's IRR and that an appellant's remedy for a claim that the IRR is erroneous lies with seeking an amended IRR from the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Lee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 7, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 301 F. App'x 926 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Rainone v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). The court specifically rejected OPM's reliance on these decisions, finding that the IRR is not necessarily binding. Additionally, the Board has found that it can determine whether OPM properly relied on the IRR. <span class="Italic">O'Connell v.

Under the circumstances of this appeal, where the appellant established by preponderant evidence that he made the deposit for his military service and the record shows that the payment was not recorded on the appellant's IRR and/or not transmitted to OPM, we find that OPM improperly relied on the appellant's IRR.</p>

Cir. 2016), sent an appeal back to the Board to resolve inconsistencies on an IRR that affected retirement pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Daniel Grover applied for a retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System after he retired as a customs officer. By statute, the annuity must reflect the highest average annual pay based on three consecutive years of specified service, and for a customs officer like Mr. Grover in the years in question, the calculation must include overtime pay up to $17,500. The Office of Personnel Management, in calculating Mr. Grover's pay for the years in question, did not include anything close to $17,500 in overtime pay, although Mr. Grover asserted that he received more than $17,500 in overtime pay in those years. The Merit Systems Protection Board rejected Mr. Grover's challenge to OPM's calculation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM relied on a particular official record for its calculation. But neither OPM nor the Board recognized that the record is internally contradictory about what overtime pay Mr. Grover received. Accordingly, neither OPM nor the Board sought further information--such as pay stubs--that might definitively resolve the uncertainty and determine what overtime pay Mr. Grover actually received. Moreover, the Board and OPM relied on a legal ground that seems to make the factual issue immaterial even in the face of internally conflicting information in the official record used by OPM for its calculation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That ground, as OPM now agrees, is incorrect, and the key official record, OPM also now agrees, is in fact internally inconsistent. Although OPM points to a regulation as independently supporting the result challenged in this appeal, by authorizing it to rely on the official record it used, that regulation does not address what to do when the record is internally contradictory. In this case, moreover, we have been shown no reason why objective documentation (pay stubs) should not be available to resolve the issue (the amount of overtime pay) definitively. At least in this circumstance, the regulation does not permit the Board to affirm OPM's calculation without resolving the amount-of-overtime-pay factual issue. <span id="Page_4404"></span>We vacate the Board's decision and remand for a determination of that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Mr. Grover retired, OPM turned for information about his pay to the National Finance Center, which "was the servicing payroll office for Customs and Border Protection." It did so in accord with its general practice under an OPM regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.103, which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Standard Form 2806 (Individual Retirement Record) is the basic record for action on all claims for annuity or refund, and those pertaining to deceased employees, deceased Members, or deceased annuitants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;When the records of the department or agency concerned are lost, destroyed, or incomplete, the department or agency shall request the General Accounting Office, through OPM, to furnish the data that it considers necessary for a proper determination of the rights of the claimant. When an official record cannot develop the required information, the department, agency, or OPM should request inferior or secondary evidence which is then admissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The National Finance Center prepared and certified Mr. Grover's Individual Retirement Record (IRR), Standard Form 2806, though--seemingly with some involvement from OPM--it had to prepare more than one version until it arrived at a final one. OPM, for its part, made calculations of average pay, revised them, and revised them some more before arriving--in Mr. Grover's second Board appeal--at a final calculation of average pay. The alterations involved details of the calculation that are not the focus of the current dispute. Also not in dispute is that the three years in question are Mr. Grover's final years on the job, from August 2005 to August 2008. OPM provided its final explanation in its April 2014 Letter, during Mr. Grover's second Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In choosing to rely on the deduction information of Form 2806 and not use the Remarks information, OPM followed a general practice reflected in a sentence of OPM's <span class="Italic">CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices</span> at Chapter 81, Section 81A2.2-2, Paragraph E (April 1998): "OPM computes Customs Service cases using deductions to determine the average salary." In this case, OPM in its April 2014 Letter did not state that the Remarks in Mr. Grover's Form 2806 were inaccurate, or otherwise explain them, and it did not even recognize that there was a striking internal disparity between the Remarks and deduction information on the Form. Accordingly, it did not recognize that the disparity might be addressed by seeking more information such as the actual pay stubs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision, following OPM's April 2014 Letter, strongly appears to rely on an incorrect legal ground. The Board asserted that "only pay subject to retirement deductions may be used to compute average pay for retirement purposes," just as OPM had stated that "[o]nly pay subject to retirement deductions can be used to compute an average salary for an annuity." The Board, like OPM, relied on that assertion as a basis for using the Form 2806 deductions (converted to earnings) without any inquiry into their accuracy, even into their consistency with other information on Form 2806. We therefore read the Board's statement, and OPM's, as a legal proposition that average-pay calculation <span class="Italic">must</span> be based on information about the deductions reported on Form 2806 as having been taken. That proposition is incorrect, as OPM now recognizes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At most, OPM has a "long-standing, OPM-wide practice," reflected in the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>. That "practice" does not and cannot override the clear statutory annuity standard, which provides no room for "excluding from the calculation of average salary for retirement annuity purposes any pay, including overtime pay under COPRA, that is actually received and is properly part of the average salary computation." The deduction converted-to-earnings method used by OPM will generally produce the statutorily required calculation "[p]rovided that the employing agency deducts the correct retirement contributions as required by law and properly certifies the amount of those deductions to OPM." But in this court OPM now correctly declines to defend the idea, reflected in its April 2014 Letter and in the Board's opinion, that the reported-deduction method is automatically legally correct, even when those assumptions do not hold true.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision is also unsupported by substantial evidence--evidence that a reasonable mind may take as sufficient to establish a conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Dickinson v. Zurko</span>, 527 U.S. 150, 162 (1999); <span class="Italic">Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm'n</span>, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). The Board (like the administrative judge) read Form 2806 as establishing that $17,500 was in fact included in the amounts from which deductions had been taken. But OPM now recognizes that the numbers on Form 2806 indicate the opposite. Indeed, OPM now states in plain terms that the information on Form 2806 is contradictory, inconsistent, and conflicting. The Board, like OPM until recently, failed to so recognize. Its contrary premise is conceded by OPM to be incorrect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no basis for saying that the errors made by the Board, following OPM's earlier presentations, were harmless. They led the Board, like OPM, to see no need for further inquiry into the amount of Mr. Grover's overtime pay. And this is hardly the kind of case in which there is no reason to think that further inquiry is likely to have been fruitless or unenlightening. Here, it is reasonable to expect that pay stubs could be retrieved that would objectively resolve the factual issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM makes one argument for nevertheless affirming. It points to the regulation we have quoted above, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.103, and notes that, in several non-precedential decisions, this court has deferred to OPM's interpretation of the regulation as requiring OPM to follow an Individual Retirement Record (Form 2806), rather than question its accuracy. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 350 Fed. Appx. 448, 451 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 301 Fed. Appx. 926, 928 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Rainone v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 249 Fed. Appx. 823, 825 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">see also O'Connell v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 103 M.S.P.R. 579, 580-81 (2006). We have no occasion here to question OPM's general view of the regulation. But neither the regulation nor any of our non-precedential decisions tells OPM what to do when the Form 2806 is internally contradictory on the matter in dispute. In such a situation, "follow the Form" is not an answer-producing directive. Further inquiry is required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case must be remanded to the Board. We do not know whether the record before the Board already contains the pay stubs that promise to be dispositive. At oral argument before this court, Mr. Grover's counsel--reading from a paper he was holding that he said was such a pay stub--stated that he believed the pay stubs were in the record. Regardless, as OPM noted at oral argument before us, the record in the Board was not developed with a focus on the apparent need for pay stubs as clarification. At this stage, more than eight years after Mr. Grover retired, we have been offered no reason why such pay stubs, if authentic, should not, if necessary, be added to the record to resolve this matter. Indeed, now that the focus has been placed on the factual question, perhaps the answer will prove sufficiently clear that the parties can quickly agree, and no further adversarial proceedings will be needed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under law predating <span class="Italic">Lisanti</span>, it seemed that accuracy of service dates was first to be addressed to OPM before a related annuity appeal is taken to the Board, as <span class="Italic">Rainone v. OPM</span>, 104 MSPR 423, 426-27 &#x00B6; 6-9, 2007 MSPB 12 (2007), implied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under OPM's regulations, the IRR maintained by the employing agency for employees under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) "is the basic record for action on all claims for annuity or refund."[2] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.103(a); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.102. Thus, the appellant's IRR as maintained by his employing agency, the U.S. Postal Service ("USPS"), is the basic record used in determining the appellant's annuity. Here, the appellant's IRR, as corrected by his employing agency, shows that his LDPS was July 28, 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Similarly, under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), the employing agency must establish and maintain individual retirement records for its employees that then becomes the "basic record for action on all claims for annuity or refund." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's review in determining whether OPM properly calculated a retirement annuity is limited to whether OPM properly relied upon the IRR. <span class="Italic">See O'Connell v.

The Board has found this limited review consistent with analogous situations where the Board has determined that it is without jurisdiction to review agency certifications regarding retirement matters. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Bacani v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 588, 592-94 (1994) (under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d), compensation determinations by the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot be reviewed by any other agency), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 56 F.3d 79 (Fed.

Indeed the Board has consistently held that OPM is entitled to rely on the information contained in the IRR unless and until the IRR is amended by the employing agency and that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review the employing agency's certification of an IRR. <span class="Italic">See O'Connell</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The annuity of an employee retiring under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337 for disability shall commence on the first day of the month after separation from service or after pay ceases and the service and age or disability requirements for title to an annuity are met. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(b)(1). Although the Board stated in its underlying opinion that the appellant's last day in pay status was June 19, 1999, and that he was disabled from performing useful and efficient service in his position of record during the period from June 19, 1999, to his voluntary retirement on January 31, 2004, <span class="Italic">Rainone</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 13, the corrected certified record of the appellant's IRR shows <span id="Page_4405"></span>that his last day in pay status was July 28, 2000. Moreover, it appears that this corrected date was predicated on the employing agency's pay documentation that the appellant worked in the year 2000 for one pay period (pay period 16). Thus, based on the documentation, it appears that although the appellant may have been disabled from performing useful and efficient service in his position since June 19, 1999, his pay had not "ceased" if he returned to a pay status prior to his separation. <span class="Italic">See Young v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 563, &#x00B6; 12 (2005). Because the record shows that OPM relied on a certified corrected IRR for a LDPS of July 28, 2000, in light of the employing agency's record that the appellant returned to a pay status in 2000, we find that OPM properly relied on the IRR for this information to calculate the appellant's disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See O'Connell</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant argues that his employing agency's certified record relating to his return to a pay status and his LDPS was erroneous, and that the Board should order OPM to rectify the matter.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that section 831.103(a) entitles OPM to rely on information in the employing agency's official IRR unless the agency amends that information. <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 579, 580-81 (2006). Based on that regulation, the Board has ruled that it lacks jurisdiction to order OPM to obtain a corrected IRR and has held that the Board is limited to determining whether OPM "properly relied" on the submitted IRR when calculating the amount of any retirement right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 580. The Board has explained that an employee's recourse, in cases in which the employee contends that the IRR is incorrect, is not to seek relief from the Board but to seek correction of the IRR by the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 581; <span class="Italic">see Maxwell v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 350, 357-59 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation does not by its terms state that neither OPM nor the Board may question the accuracy of an agency's IRR in the course of calculating a retirement annuity. However, OPM and the Board have construed the regulation in that manner. OPM's interpretation of its own regulation is entitled to substantial deference. <span class="Italic">Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 461-62 (1997); <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co.</span>, 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945); <span class="Italic">Cathedral Candle Co. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 400 F.3d 1352, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Because OPM's interpretation is not unlawful or plainly contrary to the text of the regulation, we defer to that interpretation. We therefore sustain the Board's ruling that an employing agency's IRR is binding on OPM and the Board with respect to questions as to an annuitant's employment record in cases in which the IRR or other similar record is not lost, destroyed, or incomplete.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board has explained, the proper remedy for a person in Mr. Rainone's position is to seek relief from the federal employer in the first instance, requesting a correction of his records. Absent a satisfactory resolution by the agency, the employee may not seek relief from the Merit Systems Protection Board, but is required to pursue his legal rights in district court under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it may not be necessary for Mr. Rainone to seek relief through that mechanism, as government counsel has advised us that the Postal Service has reviewed Mr. Rainone's records and has determined that a revision of his IRR may be in order. The government has further suggested that, after the Postal Service makes a final determination with respect to amending Mr. Rainone's IRR, it may be appropriate for us to remand this case to the Board with directions that the Board remand the case to OPM for adjustment of Mr. Rainone's benefits in light of the revision in his records. In response to the government's post-briefing submissions, Mr. Rainone has filed a motion for a stay of proceedings in this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we recognize that Mr. Rainone may be entitled to a change in the amount of his award from OPM, we do not believe that remanding the case to the Board is the proper course for us to follow. The Board has held that it lacks jurisdiction over this matter, and we have upheld that ruling; it is therefore not clear that the Board has any authority to order relief or to direct OPM to grant relief to Mr. Rainone. Nor do we believe there is any reason to postpone ruling on the narrow legal issue presented in this appeal, i.e., whether the Board has jurisdiction to review the correctness of an employee's IRR. Accordingly, we <span class="Italic">deny</span> Mr. Rainone's motion for a stay of proceedings. In light of the representations made to the court by government counsel, we are confident that the Postal Service will complete its reexamination of Mr. Rainone's employment records and amend his IRR, if appropriate, without further order from this court or the Board. If Mr. Rainone is dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter after the Postal Service decides whether and how to amend his IRR, his remedy is to seek to vindicate his rights by an action under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Lisanti</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 350 Fed. Appx. 448, 450-51 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), reemphasized the primacy of the individual retirement record and the rather indirect route that must be followed to obtain its correction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly concluded that OPM could only rely on the certified IRR when reviewing Ms. Thomas's average annual retirement salary and monthly annuities. In addition to pay stubs, Ms. Thomas offers, among other things, W-2s and emails between her and USPS employees as evidence of her higher average retirement salary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To calculate Ms. Thomas's retirement salary, the Board considered that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard Form 2806 (Individual Retirement Record) is the basic record for action on all claims for annuity</span> or refund, and those pertaining to deceased employees, deceased Members, or deceased annuitants.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.103 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and OPM interpreted &#x00A7; 831.103 to mean that they may not question the accuracy of an IRR when calculating a retirement salary. This court accords the OPM's interpretation of its own regulations substantial deference. <span class="Italic">See Easter v. United States,</span> 575 F.3d 1332, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 301 Fed. Appx. 926, 928 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (deferring to OPM's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.103 because "it is not unlawful or plainly contrary to the text of the regulation"); <span class="Italic">see also Rainone v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 249 Fed. Appx. 823, 825 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (same). Because Ms. Thomas's IRR was not "lost, destroyed or stolen," OPM was justified in relying on the information in the IRR and discounting Ms. Thomas's other evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Thomas argues that OPM and the Board submitted no proof that the IRR is correct. The burden, however, is on Ms. Thomas to show that the IRR is inaccurate. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 791 F.2d 138, 141 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Lee,</span> 301 Fed. Appx. at 928. If Ms. Thomas believes that the IRR is incorrect, then she must obtain a corrected IRR from the USPS. The AJ provided Ms. Thomas an opportunity to do so. Ms. Thomas, however, was unsuccessful in her attempt. If Ms. Thomas is unsatisfied with the USPS's production of her IRR, she may file suit in federal district court for a review of this issue, but not the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Lee,</span> 301 Fed. Appx. at 929 (noting that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(c) grants a cause of action in federal district court when an agency fails to maintain accurate records upon which a benefit determination is based).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Thomas also asserts that the AJ abused his discretion by denying her discovery and recusal motions. According to Ms. Thomas, discovery is needed so that the AJ can properly understand the case and ensure that "all positive letters, forms, etc. that are in appellant's favor are in the record." MSPB regulations permit the AJ to limit discovery if "the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(d)(3) (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ correctly noted that the IRR was the basic record for all annuity claims. Further, &#x00A7; 831.103(b) allows other evidence only if the IRR is "lost, stolen or incomplete." Ms. Thomas alleged that her IRR was incorrect, not lost, stolen or incomplete. Thus, the documents that Ms. Thomas sought through discovery were not admissible under &#x00A7; 831.103. As a result, the AJ did not abuse his discretion when he denied Ms. Thomas's discovery request because the burden on OPM outweighed the likely benefit to Ms. Thomas.</p>

The Board was not clear whether it was then disclaiming jurisdiction over all IRR disputes of all employees or agencies, or just as to those of VA medical personnel employed under Title 38 USC, as to whom the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has relatively unreviewable discretion in compensation matters under 38 USC 7422(d)).<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Lepore v.
