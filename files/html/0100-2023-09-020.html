<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-21"><span class="space">7.</span> Negative OPM Reconsideration Decision Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a> of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> explains the process of application and qualification for federal employees' retirement benefits. The MSPB adjudicates claims for those benefits once an appeal is taken from an unfavorable determination--a final decision often known as a reconsideration decision--on a retirement claim processed by the Office of Personnel Management. Without providing a right of OPM reconsideration as a prerequisite to a final and appealable decision, OPM may issue a final and immediately appealable decision--a path infrequently followed. The process is described by the OPM regulations explaining how final decisions are made by OPM and appealed to MSPB, 5 CFR 831.109-.110 (2022) (Civil Service Retirement System):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 831.109 <span class="Italic">Initial decision and reconsideration</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Who may file</span>. Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section any individual or agency whose rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System are affected by an initial decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may request OPM to review its initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Actions covered elsewhere</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A request for reconsideration of termination of annuity payments under 5 U.S.C. 8311-22 shall be made in accordance with the procedures set out in subpart K of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A request for reconsideration of a decision to collect a debt will be made in accordance with &#x00A7; 831.1304(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial decision</span>. A decision shall be considered an initial decision when rendered by OPM in writing and stating the right to reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reconsideration</span>. A request for reconsideration must be in writing, must include the individual's name, address, date of birth and claim number, if applicable, and must state the basis for the request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limits on reconsideration</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A request for reconsideration must be received by OPM within 30 calendar days from the date of the original decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The representative of the Associate Director for Compensation responsible for reconsiderations may extend the time limit for filing when the individual shows that he/she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he/she was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her control from making the request within the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Final decision</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;After reconsideration, the Associate Director's representative shall issue a final decision which shall be in writing, shall fully set forth the findings and conclusions of the reconsideration, and shall contain notice of the right to request an appeal provided in &#x00A7; 831.110. Copies of the final decision shall be sent to the individual, to any competing claimants and, where applicable, to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;OPM may issue a final decision providing the opportunity to appeal under &#x00A7; 831.110 rather than an opportunity to request reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section. Such a decision must be in writing and state the right to appeal under &#x00A7; 831.110.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Competing claimants</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;When a competing claimant files a request for reconsideration under this section, the other competing claimants shall be notified <span id="Page_884"></span>of the request and given an opportunity to submit written substantiation of their claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;When a determination in favor of one claimant would affect another claimant, all claimants concerned will be notified of that decision and those adversely affected will be given an opportunity to request reconsideration. OPM shall not execute its decision until the time limit for requesting reconsideration has expired. If reconsideration has been requested, OPM shall take no action after the reconsideration decision is rendered until the time limit to appeal has expired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 831.110 <span class="Italic">Appeals</span>.</p>

An OPM decision "is subject to reconsideration by OPM[ ] whenever the decision is in writing and states the right to reconsideration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 841.305.

As noted, both types of decisions must be final, must be in writing, and must notify the retiree regarding her right to appeal the final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The statutory and regulatory provisions governing the Board's jurisdiction from appeals involving disability retirement annuities, when read together, generally require a final decision by OPM as a prerequisite. For example, the statute governing FERS provides that "an administrative <span class="Italic">action or order</span> affecting the rights or interests of an individual...may be appealed to [the Board] under procedures prescribed by the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Joseph v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 776 F. App'x 676, 678 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (non-precedential). OPM's regulations provide, more specifically, that "an individual whose rights or interests under FERS are affected by a <span class="Italic">final decision</span> of OPM may request [the Board] to review the decision in accord with procedures prescribed by [the Board]." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.308 (emphasis added). The Board's regulations, in turn, reiterate that its "appellate jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation," and they further identify provisions governing "[r]etirement appeals," including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) and 5 C.F.R. part 844, as provisions that "authoriz[e] the Board to hear an appeal or claim." See 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3. Aside from cases involving final decisions by OPM, we have also recognized a limited exception in which the Board may exercise jurisdiction where OPM "has refused or improperly failed to issue a final decision." <span class="Italic">Stillwell v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 629 F. App'x 998, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board did not err in dismissing Ms. Henderson's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. "The party asserting jurisdiction bears the burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Board had jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Mouton-Miller v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 985 F.3d 864, 869 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (citing <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)); see also 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2). The record before us contains no indication that OPM issued an appealable decision or improperly refused to issue one, such that the Board could properly assert jurisdiction. Instead, the record shows that OPM notified Ms. Henderson that her disability retirement annuity rate had been recalculated after her 62nd birthday, as required by law, and that she disagreed with an OPM <span id="Page_885"></span>employee in a phone call regarding the salary figure that should be used to determine the rate of her annuity. These facts alone are insufficient to establish the Board's jurisdiction, and Ms. Henderson has not proffered any additional evidence or argument that suffices to do so. We therefore affirm the Board's decision dismissing Ms. Henderson's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, we note that, as far as we can determine from the informal briefs and record in this case, Ms. Henderson's case appears to remain pending before the OPM. It is not clear from the record whether she has submitted the proper paperwork to OPM challenging an actual reduction in her benefits that resulted from OPM's use of an incorrect salary figure. Nor does the record show that OPM has issued a final decision concerning which salary figure it will use to determine her annuity's rate. If and when OPM issues a final decision on which salary figure it will use, Ms. Henderson may agree with it, or she may not. If she does not agree, she can appeal that final decision in accordance with the instructions that should be provided in the final decision. See 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 841.306&#x2013;307.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bactad v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3501), noted that the Board and its reviewing court consider the merits of a retirement claim only after the administrative process is complete:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over retirement benefit cases is defined by 5 USC &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1), which states that "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the U.S. under this subchapter may be appealed to the [MSPB] under procedures prescribed by the Board." The "administrative action or order" referred to in &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) is a "final decision" by OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.110 (1993). Thus, a person seeking retirement benefits must first apply to OPM to establish his entitlement to benefits. If dissatisfied with OPM's decision, the applicant may seek review by the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government states in its brief that apparently Mr. Bactad has never filed an application for benefits with OPM. Mr. Bactad does not state that he did. He simply asked the MSPB and now asks this court to award him benefits. Mr. Bactad must apply to OPM first to establish his rights and must submit evidence to that agency of his employment. Neither the MSPB nor this court can undertake to investigate his claim or simply award benefits. We may only review his entitlement based on the record considered by OPM if OPM denies him benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Joseph v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-2241.Opinion.6-7-2019.pdf">776 Fed. Appx. 676, 678-79</a> (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB has jurisdiction over "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual...under [the FERS as] administered by [OPM]," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1); <span class="Italic">see Miller v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 449 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that the MSPB has statutory jurisdiction over OPM's administration of the law establishing FERS), which typically issues its determination as a final decision, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.308 ("[A]n individual whose rights or interests under FERS are affected by a <span class="Italic">final decision</span> of OPM may request MSPB to review the decision...." (emphasis added)). For purposes of OPM decisions under FERS, OPM's regulations identify two types of decisions that are final and appealable to the MSPB: (1) a "reconsideration" decision, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.306(e) and (2) a decision that expressly provides for an opportunity to appeal without "an opportunity [for a claimant] to request reconsideration," under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.307.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;By contrast, an OPM "decision subject to reconsideration" is not a final decision appealable to the MSPB under OPM's regulations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.305(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Joseph contends the MSPB erred in dismissing his challenge to OPM's refund decision, arguing that he was entitled to an annuity from OPM. He further claims that "OPM failed to respond to [his request] for reconsideration." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB did not err in determining that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Mr. Joseph's appeal. Mr. Joseph has failed to identify any supporting evidence of the alleged refund or any initial or final written decision by OPM on the issue of his entitlement to a refund of FERS payments rather than a retirement annuity. Additionally, Mr. Joseph has not alleged with any supporting evidence that he filed a request for reconsideration before OPM. The record similarly lacks evidence of a refund check, or an initial or final decision by OPM. Therefore, Mr. Joseph has failed to meet his burden to prove that OPM has issued an initial or final decision with notice of MSPB appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins</span>, 911 F.3d at 1373.[3] Although this court generally interprets the pleadings of a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioner liberally, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Durr v. Nicholson</span>, 400 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2005), we may not "take a liberal view of [a] jurisdictional requirement [such as the requirement to have a final decision] and set a different requirement for <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants only," <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Labor</span>, 812 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (italics omitted). Because Mr. Joseph filed his MSPB appeal before obtaining a final, appealable decision by OPM, the MSPB correctly found his appeal premature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We are aware that the MSPB has previously held that jurisdiction existed where OPM "has refused or improperly failed to issue a final decision" such as failing to issue a decision within a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">Stillwell v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 629 F. App'x 998, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <span class="Italic">Malone v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 590 F. App'x 1002, 1003 (Fed.

Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 41 F.3d 1520 (Table) (Fed. Cir. 1994) (acknowledging that the MSPB has held in another case that OPM's fourteen-month delay in responding to an individual's request for reconsideration did not preclude MSPB jurisdiction). Here, however, OPM has expressly stated it will be issuing a final decision on the merits of Mr. Joseph's MSPB Appeal, and therefore we do not find constructive denial as an applicable, narrow exception permitting the MSPB to take jurisdiction in this case without a final or reconsideration decision from OPM.</p>

Likewise, the Board is prohibited from issuing an advisory opinion on the appellant's eligibility to retire on a certain date. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h).

DOD,</span> DC-0752-10-0741-I-1 (NP 3/4/2011) ("The appellant also asserts that the agency should have provided him with the opportunity to retire under the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) and that the Board must have jurisdiction over the agency's decision not to authorize VERA....&#8197;However, the appellant offers no statutes, cases, or regulations to support his proposition that the Board has jurisdiction. In fact, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 573, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 65 F.3d 186 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), the Board held that it was unaware of any statute or regulation that gives the Board jurisdiction over such offers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 577."). And, as to law enforcement officer early retirement eligibility, <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 1, 7 (1998), emphasized the Board's adherence to OPM procedures governing submission of requests for status determinations to employing agencies. [<span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> is discussed in Chapter 14, "<a href="0100-2023-21-135.html#sec14-134">Agency Head Determination; Timeliness of Request for LEO Status</a>"; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-026.html#sec2-27">Law Enforcement Officer Retirement Credit Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(f), a final decision must contain a written notice of a Board appeal right. <span class="Italic">Lee v. OPM</span>, AT-0831-16-0252-I-1 (NP 9/23/2016). If OPM issued a past final decision on a retirement issue, correspondence from OPM referencing that decision does not reactivate the time for appeal; the correspondence is not itself another final and appealable decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Muli v. MSPB</span>, 268 Fed. Appx. 965 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP). For the effect of OPM's rescission of its earlier approval of a disability retirement annuity on the timing of a Board appeal, refer to <span class="Italic">Arizpe v. OPM</span>, 88 MSPR 463 (2001), and decisions discussed in that decision. But when OPM issues a second reconsideration decision, or something approximating a second reconsideration decision, the appellate time limit begins anew. <span class="Italic">Kalus v. DHS</span>, 123 MSPR 226, 229 &#x00B6; 11, 2016 MSPB 9 (2016), a whistleblower reprisal appeal, analogized OSC closeout letters to OPM reconsideration decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, our decision to accept this appeal as timely filed is consistent with the Board's analysis in appeals of the final decisions of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under similar circumstances. Like IRA appeals, which require exhaustion before OSC, certain retirement matters can be appealed to the Board within 30 days after the appellant receives a final decision from OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.110, 1201.22(b)(1). The Board has found that OPM's issuance of a second final decision creates a new filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 395, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9 (2010); <span class="Italic">see also House v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 161, 165-66 (1990) (finding that OPM's issuance of a letter supplementing its final decision created a new filing deadline). Similarly, the Board also has recognized that OPM's issuance of a prior final decision does not preclude the Board from taking jurisdiction over a matter pursuant to a subsequent final decision by OPM regarding the same matter. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2012); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an individual's appeal as to an annuity is dismissed as premature based on incorrect information from the appellant and OPM as to the status of a reconsideration decision, the Board may remand the case for a proper timeliness determination once the date of issuance of the reconsideration decision is sorted out.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Moorer v. OPM,</span> 104 MSPR 609, 2007 MSPB 36 (2007). The Board may remand to OPM to issue a reconsideration decision on a specific point raised during an appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">MacGregor v. OPM</span>, PH-0845-15-0340-I-2 (NP 7/27/2016) ("Here, as the administrative judge correctly found, OPM, in its reconsideration decision, did not address the material question in this overpayment appeal that the appellant raised in her request for reconsideration, namely, the proper calculation of her annuity. Thus, he properly remanded the case to OPM for issuance of a new reconsideration decision because OPM previously had not addressed all issues necessary for adjudication of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Litzenberger</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. Consequently, the Board cannot adjudicate the appellant's claims challenging the overpayment until OPM issues a reconsideration decision addressing all of the issues raised by the appellant in her request for reconsideration."). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a> for a detailed discussion of adjudication of appeals involving retirement entitlements and disability issues that arise in retirement appeals; refer to this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-131.html#sec2-129">OPM Rescinds Reconsideration or Final Decision; Overpayment Recovery; Withdrawal of or Additional Retirement Application; Disputed Retirement Calculations</a>," concerning moot appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined jurisdiction over a request to OPM to amend a favorable disability annuity determination to add other causes of the disability to the one cause found by OPM to justify the annuity. The other conditions could be later addressed if OPM discontinued the annuity, <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. OPM</span>, 118 MSPR 632, 633-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10, 2012 MSPB 125 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for disability retirement under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) based on a number of medical conditions. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) subsequently notified the appellant that it was approving her application on the basis of only one claimed condition, i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The appellant thereafter sent numerous letters to OPM requesting that it amend its determination so as to include her other claimed disabilities, i.e., lumbar disc, right heel, and psychological conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, OPM issued a September 28, 2009 letter denying the appellant's request to amend the basis upon which OPM approved her disability retirement application. After receiving subsequent requests by the appellant, on January 25, 2011, OPM again notified her that it would not amend its decision regarding her retirement application as requested and that it considered the matter closed. The appellant filed an appeal seeking review of OPM's denial of her requests to amend its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge advised the appellant that the Board may not have jurisdiction over her appeal and ordered her to file evidence and argument showing that the Board has the requisite jurisdiction. Thereafter, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, in part, on the ground that no legal authority provides for an appeal of OPM's decision not to amend the medical conditions that formed the basis for an approved disability retirement. The appellant timely filed a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If OPM has not issued a reconsideration decision on an appellant's entitlement to a retirement benefit, the Board generally lacks jurisdiction over an appeal of that matter. <span class="Italic">Fagone v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 49, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). However, the Board may take jurisdiction over a retirement appeal in the absence of a reconsideration decision if the appellant has made "repeated requests" for such a decision and the evidence indicates that OPM does not intend to issue a final decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the appellant's repeated requests for a final decision regarding her other allegedly disabling medical conditions, we believe that OPM's January 25, 2011 letter was tantamount to a final decision by OPM on this matter. <span class="Italic">See Sims v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 102, &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (the appellant made repeated requests for a decision, and OPM's letter explaining its position was tantamount to a reconsideration decision). Accordingly, the Board is not deprived of jurisdiction over the appeal based on OPM's failure to issue a reconsideration decision. Rather, as we discuss below, the Board lacks authority to adjudicate the instant appeal because OPM has not taken an action or made a decision that affects the appellant's rights or interests under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over final decisions of OPM in administering FERS derives from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1). <span class="Italic">Niederhofer v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6; 5 (2010). That section provides that "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual...under the provisions of this chapter administered by [OPM] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We interpret this language as meaning that the Board's statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) extends only to OPM actions or orders that <span class="Italic">adversely</span> affect an individual's rights or interests under FERS. Because the appellant in this case has failed to show how OPM has adversely affected her rights or interests under FERS, the Board lacks jurisdiction over her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, it is undisputed that OPM approved the appellant's disability application under FERS and has not terminated its approval. If OPM were to determine that the appellant was no longer entitled to a disability retirement annuity, it would first issue the appellant notice and allow her the opportunity to challenge that decision. Only after OPM has issued a decision terminating the appellant's disability retirement would the issue be ripe for the Board's consideration. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 118, &#x00B6; 14 (2010) (only after OPM issues a decision determining that the appellant has received an overpayment would the appellant be able to request reconsideration and, if necessary, file a Board appeal regarding that issue).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;While <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> is a case that arose under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), we have cited to it because the regulatory <span id="Page_887"></span>requirements for establishing disability retirement claims under CSRS and FERS are broadly similar. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 686, 689 n.2 (1992). Further, the differences that do exist between these systems do not affect the applicability of <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Board has the authority to consider evidence relating to a medical condition on which the appellant based her application. <span class="Italic">See Hunt v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6; 18 n.5 (2007) (the Board may consider medical evidence that was not submitted to OPM so long as it is related to a medical condition which formed the basis of the appellant's application). <span class="Italic">But see Ballenger v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 138, &#x00B6; 13 (2006) (the Board may not consider whether an appellant is entitled to reinstatement of a disability retirement annuity due to a medical condition that was neither the basis for the appellant's application nor the basis for OPM's decision to grant disability retirement). Here, the appellant is requesting that OPM find her disabled based on medical conditions listed in her disability retirement application. Thus, if OPM were to revoke the appellant's disability annuity, the Board would have the authority to consider medical evidence regarding these other allegedly disabling medical conditions. <span class="Italic">See Hunt</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6; 18 n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, based on the circumstances of this case, OPM has not taken an action or made a decision which adversely affected the appellant's rights or interests under FERS. The Board therefore lacks authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) to adjudicate this appeal.</p>
