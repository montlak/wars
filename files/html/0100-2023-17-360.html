<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-358"><span class="space">28.</span> Grievance, ULP Settlement</h4>
<p class="noindent">If a matter is settled and a party attacks the settlement during the course of arbitration, FLRA will not lightly disturb an award that protects the settlement, <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 40 FLRA 839, 848 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As noted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, "[t]hose who employ the judicial appellate process to attack a settlement through which controversy has been sent to rest bear a properly heavy burden." <span class="Italic">Asberry v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982). In order to attack a settlement agreement arising from a federal civilian personnel action, it must be shown that the agreement was tainted with invalidity, either by fraud or mutual mistake. In <span class="Italic">Asberry</span>, the court found no invalidity and determined that the case involved a typical settlement situation in which each party gives up something in order to terminate the dispute without further litigation....&#8197;Having found that the employee voluntarily accepted the settlement and its benefits, the court held that the employee was "equitably estopped to attack it."...&#8197;In this case, the Union makes no showing of fraud or mutual mistake. Because the Union has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's interpretation and application of the MOU is deficient or that the MCU is otherwise invalid, we find that the Union is barred from attacking it.</p>
<p class="noindent">A grievance settlement was upheld despite the union's claim that the proper union official did not authorize the settlement. Declining to set aside an award that sustained the settlement, FLRA outlined the principles of agency, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2207 and VAMC, Birmingham</span>, 52 FLRA 1477, 1480-81 (1997) (following remand on other issues, 55 FLRA 469 (1999)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The authority of the vice president to sign the settlement agreement is determined under principles of agency law.&#x2003;Applying these principles, the enforceability of the December 1989 settlement agreement requires an examination of: (1) the scope of the vice president's authority to enter into a settlement agreement; and (2) whether the December 8 letter effectively terminated that authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an agency relationship a principal confides to an agent the management of business to be transacted in the former's name. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 3 Am. Jur. 2d <span class="Italic">Agency</span> &#x00A7; 1 (1986). The authority of an agent to act on behalf of the principal can be either actual or apparent. Actual authority is authority that the principal has intentionally conferred upon the agent. <span class="Italic">See, for example, U.S. v. Schaltenbrand</span>, 930 F.2d 1554, 1560 (11th Cir. 1991). Apparent authority occurs where the principal has held out the agent as having such authority or has permitted the agent to represent that he has such authority. 3 Am. Jur. 2d <span class="Italic">Agency</span> &#x00A7; 78 (1986). It has been held that "when an agent is appointed to negotiate a collective-bargaining agreement that agent is deemed to have apparent authority to bind his principal in the absence of clear notice to the contrary." <span class="Italic">Metco Products, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 884 F.2d 156, 159 (4th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Metco</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">University</span> <span class="Italic">of Bridgeport</span>, 229 NLRB 1074 (1977)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority will be terminated if the agent is given sufficient notice. 3 Am. Jur. 2d <span class="Italic">Agency</span> &#x00A7; 51 (1986). Sufficient notice occurs if the agent actually knows, or has reason to know, facts indicating that the authority has been terminated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the acts of an agent whose authority has been revoked may continue to bind a principal as against third persons who, in the absence of notice of the revocation of the agent's authority, rely upon its continued existence. 3 Am. Jur. 2d <span class="Italic">Agency</span> &#x00A7; 52 (1986). <span class="Italic">See Southwest</span> <span class="Italic">Sunsites, Inc. v. F.T.C.</span>, 785 F.2d 1431, 1438 (9th Cir. 1986) (a principal is bound by the acts of its agent if those acts are within the scope of the agent's authority, unless the third party has actual notice that the acts are unauthorized).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Union president told the vice president to "handle" and "take care" of the October 1989 grievance. The Arbitrator also found that the union's national vice president, in a letter to the local president, stated that the local vice president told him that the president had given him the case to handle. Based on these findings, we conclude that, at a minimum, the vice president had apparent authority to negotiate the October 1989 agreement because he had been appointed to negotiate that agreement. <span class="Italic">Metco</span>, 884 F.2d at 159. The Arbitrator did not find that this authority was limited in any way. Based on the Arbitrator's findings, we conclude that the president gave the vice president the authority to negotiate the settlement agreement, and that this authority was not limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator did not find that the vice president's authority was later terminated. Rather, the Arbitrator credited the vice president's testimony that he had discussed the settlement with the president, who never told him that he should not proceed with it. Moreover, we note that the vice president continued to exercise such authority 14 months after the events at issue here, when he signed a supplemental agreement detailing the payments to be made as part of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, the Union would still be bound by the vice president's acts unless the Agency had clear and actual notice that his authority had been terminated. <span class="Italic">Southwest Sunsites</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc.</span>, 785 F.2d at 1438; <span class="Italic">Metco</span>, 884 F.2d at 159. The Union argues that the December 8 letter gave such notice by stating that the president "will make all final decisions on Step 3 and above issues unless he designates someone else." However, the Arbitrator found that the letter did not constitute proper notice to management of a termination of any authority the vice president may have had. Consistent with this finding, and the others set forth above, we conclude that the settlement agreement is enforceable....</p>

<p class="noindent">A settlement was upheld despite the argument that the union did not authorize it. The union had exclusive authority to invoke arbitration, but the employee could settle his own removal grievance, including a release provision, with the result that FLRA lacked jurisdiction to entertain exceptions to an award determining that a suspension was for just cause, involving a matter covered by the release, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Air Force Logistics Ctr., Warner Robins</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-047.html">61 FLRA 245</a>, 246-47 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2371"></span>Under Authority precedent, settlement agreements excluding a grievance from the negotiated grievance procedure and arbitration process are enforceable. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1592</span>, 57 FLRA 882, 883 (2002); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2207</span>, 52 FLRA 1477, 1481 (1997). Here, under the explicit terms of the settlement agreement, the grievant agreed to release "all claims and causes of action, whether administrative or judicial" that could have been asserted by the grievant against the Agency "with respect to, or in connection with, or which arise out of...his employment[.]" The terms of the agreement provide that the "sole and exclusive claim excluded" from the general release and wavier of claims is the "grievance submitted by [the grievant] under the negotiated grievance procedure on December 6, 2004, only to the extent it challenges, on the merits, the decision to remove him from federal service dated November 17, 2004[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The settlement agreement unambiguously states that the "sole and exclusive claim excluded" from the general waiver of claims is the removal grievance. It is undisputed that the parties were aware of the suspension grievance and the related exceptions pending before the Authority when they entered into the settlement agreement. As argued by the Agency, the fact that the settlement agreement specifically excludes only the removal grievance, and not the suspension grievance, from the general waiver of claims indicates that the suspension grievance was intended to be included in the waiver. Without regard to whether the grievant's fourteen-day suspension was a "first step" in his removal, the Union has not demonstrated that the suspension grievance was intended to be included in the exception to the waiver of claims for the removal grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that "the language of the settlement agreement was intended to apply to claims within the scope of claims pending in the [civil] action and to be silent on the issue of grievances." However, the agreement is not silent on the issue of grievances--it specifically excludes the removal grievance from the general waiver of claims. To permit the Union's interpretation of the waiver exception would render meaningless the grievant's release of "any and all claims and causes of action" arising out of his employment with the Agency, other than the removal griev<span class="Italic">ance. See Demarais v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America</span>, 2002 WL 31185918 at *3 (D. Minn. 2002) (where plaintiff's interpretation of waiver exception in a settlement agreement would render exception "meaningless," such interpretation was not adopted); <span class="Italic">see also McCall v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (upholding Merit Systems Protection Board's determination that employee agreed, in a settlement agreement, to waive his appeal rights where determination was consistent with unambiguous terms of the settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also claims that it cannot be bound by the settlement agreement because the grievant was the party to the settlement agreement, while the Union is the party to the arbitration of the suspension grievance, and because the settlement agreement does not resolve all of the Union's claims. Under the Statute and Authority precedent, while only the Union can invoke arbitration, an individual can file a grievance on his or her own behalf. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(C)(iii); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 17 FLRA 615, 617-18 (1985). As argued by the Agency, the grievant filed the grievance under the provision of the parties' agreement providing for individual employee grievances. The Union acknowledges that the grievant, in his individual capacity, had the authority to, and did, file an individual grievance regarding the suspension. The grievant then resolved all of his interests in the suspension grievance through the settlement agreement. The Union did not have any separate claims included in the suspension grievance. Accordingly, after the settlement agreement, no issues remained for resolution in the arbitration process. To find otherwise would permit the Union to litigate claims that the grievant had clearly waived.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the SA had no "force or effect" in the arbitration, the Arbitrator interpreted the terms of the SA. Because settlement agreements are considered to be contracts, the Authority applies the deferential "essence" standard to review an arbitrator's interpretation of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA 507, 508 (2006). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div. &#x0026; Seattle Dist.</span>, 64 FLRA 405, 409 (2010). Under the "essence" standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the settlement agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA at 508. The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained."[7] <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Labor (OSHA), </span>34 FLRA 573, 576 (1990) (<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The decisions cited in the concurrence are inapposite. In particular, none involves judicial review of an arbitrator's interpretation of a settlement agreement; all involve appellate court review of either a lower court's or an administrative agency's interpretation. It is well-established, in this regard, that judicial review of arbitral interpretations is deferential and not <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29, 36-38 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SA provides, in pertinent part, that it "shall not be used, cited[,] or relied upon by any party in connection with any other judicial or administrative proceeding[.]" The Arbitrator interpreted this as meaning that it resolved only those issues currently or potentially before the MSPB and, therefore, found that it was not a sufficient basis for dismissing the grievance. This interpretation is not inconsistent with the terms of the SA. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA at 509 (upholding arbitrator interpretation that "comports with the plain wording" of agreement). Although the Agency's contention that the agreement is a "general waiver[&#8197;] of claims," is one possible interpretation of the agreement, it does not establish that the Arbitrator's interpretation is irrational, unfounded, implausible, or manifestly in disregard of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The precedent cited by the Agency is inapposite because it does not involve Authority review of an arbitrator's interpretation of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 987</span>, 61 FLRA at 246. As stated above, where an arbitrator has interpreted an agreement between the parties, the Authority will defer to that interpretation as long as it draws its essence from the agreement. <span class="Italic">See OSHA</span>, 34 FLRA at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's interpretation draws its essence from the SA. We note that the Agency also challenges the other bases for the Arbitrator's decision that the SA had no "force or effect" in the arbitration, specifically, his findings that: (1) only the Union could withdraw the grievance because the Union, not the grievant, was a party to the arbitration; and (2) the SA was so heavily redacted that the Arbitrator could not determine whether it related to the arbitration or whether the grievant had received adequate consideration to make it binding. The Authority has held that when an arbitrator has based an award on separate and independent grounds, an appealing party must establish that all of the grounds are deficient in order to have the award found deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33, Locals 1007 &#x0026; 3957</span>, 64 FLRA 288, 291 (2009). Because the Arbitrator's interpretation of the SA constitutes a separate and independent ground for his decision not to apply the SA, and the Agency has not shown that the award fails to draw its essence from the SA, we find that there is no need to consider the Agency's remaining arguments regarding the SA. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Violation of a grievance settlement may result in a back pay award, <span class="Italic">VA Johnson Med. Ctr. and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, 58 FLRA 413, 415 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), an award of backpay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def, Educ.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that breach of a settlement agreement provides a basis for finding an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States DOD, Educ.

Region E., New Cumberland, Pa., </span>50 FLRA 282, 283 (1995)). The Arbitrator found that the grievants were affected by the Agency's violation of the parties' settlement agreement. Thus, the award satisfies the first Back Pay Act requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2372"></span>The Arbitrator also found that the grievants received "successful" performance ratings in April 2001 and that, in view of the fact that they were again rated "successful" in April 2002, there was insufficient evidence that their performance declined between April and October 2001. The Agency's contentions to the contrary do not establish that the Arbitrator's findings are in error. Further, as discussed previously, the Arbitrator found that the parties intended the settlement agreement to entitle the grievants to a promotion upon one year in grade and successful performance ratings. The Arbitrator's finding that both of these conditions were met satisfies the second Back Pay Act requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">None of the cases cited by the Agency supports a contrary conclusion.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of the Army,</span> 918 F.2d 214, 219-20 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the court specifically acknowledged that the Back Pay Act does not preclude payment in circumstances where, as here, an agency has entered into an agreement entitling employees to promotion under certain conditions. Similarly, in the three Comptroller General cases cited by the Agency, there was no settlement agreement--as there is here--requiring that the employees be promoted. <span class="Italic">See </span>unpublished Comptroller General decision <span class="Italic">In re F.E.C.,</span> B-229,290 at *1 (June 10, 1988); <span class="Italic">In re Agnes Mansell,</span> 64 Comp. Gen. 844, 846 (1985); <span class="Italic">In re Douglas C. Butler, </span>58 Comp. Gen. 51, 52 (1978). Finally, arbitrators in the two Authority decisions cited by the Agency did not make sufficient findings under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Orlando, Fla.,</span> 54 FLRA 609, 614 (1998) (arbitrator found promotion procedures improper but did not determine, "either explicitly or implicitly," what would have happened if proper procedures had been used); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2502,</span> 17 FLRA 382, 383 (1985) (arbitrator found that agency's action was arbitrary but did not find that grievant would have been promoted but for the arbitrary action). By contrast, the award in this case satisfies the Back Pay Act because the Arbitrator found that the grievants should have been, but were not, promoted in October 2001 pursuant to the settlement agreement and that, as a result, the employees were entitled to backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent">A settlement agreement may operate as an enforceable negotiated arrangement as to a matter embraced by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, meaning that an arbitrator may enforce the agreement despite a claim of infringement of management rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA 854 (2006) (sustaining award enforcing settlement pertaining to maintenance of recommended staffing levels). In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 4052 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MDC Guaynabo</span>, 65 FLRA 734, 736-37 (2011) (exceptions to award involving remedy dismissed as interlocutory, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 4052 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MDC Guaynabo</span>, 66 FLRA 688 (2012)), an abrogation standard was applied to claimed infringement on management rights of a grievance settlement involving staffing levels that the union sought to enforce through arbitration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Settlement Agreement excessively interfered with management's rights to determine its internal security practices and to assign work. The Authority recently revised the analysis that it applies when reviewing management rights exceptions to arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102, 106-07 (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>). Under the revised analysis, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted management right. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 115. If so, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority assesses: (1) whether the contract provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) if so, whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement abrogates the exercise of the management right. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116-18. In concluding that it would apply an abrogation standard, the Authority rejected continued application of an excessive interference standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 118. Furthermore, in setting forth the revised analysis, the Authority rejected the continued application of the "reconstruction" requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP. FDIC, S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA at 106-07.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that enforcement of the Settlement Agreement would "excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices" and its right to assign work and, thus, that "no remedy can be or is awarded." However, the revised analysis requires us to determine whether the award abrogates the exercise of a management right.[3] An award abrogates the exercise of a management right if the award precludes the agency from exercising the right. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 65 FLRA 171, 174 (2010). The Arbitrator's award does not preclude the Agency from exercising its rights to determine its internal security practices or to assign work because the Settlement Agreement does not require the Agency to assign a number two officer in all cases. Rather, the Settlement Agreement imposes this requirement only when the population at a housing unit at MDC reaches 150 inmates. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Atlanta, Ga.</span>, 57 FLRA 406, 411 (2001) (finding that the arbitrator's award did not abrogate management's rights where the agency was not required to fill vacant posts in all situations). Therefore, the Settlement Agreement does not abrogate the cited management rights, and the Arbitrator erred by finding that he could not enforce it and provide a remedy. Accordingly, we set aside the award and remand this matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The parties do not dispute that the Settlement Agreement affects management's rights to determine internal security practices and assign work. Additionally, the parties do not dispute that the Settlement Agreement is an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs Northwestern Div. and UPTO</span>, 64 FLRA 405, 407-08 (2010), upheld an award involving a grievance settlement resulting from impact bargaining over a management decision on how to fill vacancies, constituting a permissible subject of bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has expressly held that grievance settlements are binding on the parties and enforceable.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H.

In ruling that the question of the existence of a collective bargaining agreement is a question of fact, the Authority specifically relied on the approach of the National Labor Relations Board and the federal courts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bobbie Brooks, Inc. v. Int'l Ladies Garment Workers Union,</span> 835 F.2d 1164 (6th Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">Bobbie Brooks</span>); <span class="Italic">Arco Electric Co. v.

As explained by the court in <span class="Italic">Bobbie Brooks,</span> the principles controlling a determination of whether a collective bargaining agreement exists are well established. "A meeting of the minds of the parties must occur before a labor contract is created." 835 F.2d at 1168 (citing <span class="Italic">Interprint Co.,</span> 273 NLRB 1863 (1985)); <span class="Italic">accord FAA,</span> 53 FLRA at 317.

<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator's determination of <span id="page_2373"></span>the existence of a collective bargaining agreement is a factual finding to which we defer, the Agency's contrary-to-law arguments generally provide no basis for finding the award deficient. In this regard, the Agency claims that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator improperly found that the earlier grievance response letter issued by the Division's Chief of Operations constitutes a settlement agreement. However, the Arbitrator found that the earlier grievance response letter was the product of the Union Vice President's and the Division's Chief of Operation's joint efforts to resolve the earlier grievance. Based on the record, the Arbitrator made a "specific finding of fact" to conclude that the earlier grievance response letter was intended to constitute the settlement agreement for that grievance and that it was binding on the parties for future similar disputes, as here. In these circumstances, the Agency has not established that, by finding that the grievance response letter constitutes a settlement agreement, the award is contrary to law. As discussed above, in evaluating an exception alleging that an arbitration award is contrary to law, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, Arlington, Va.,</span> 60 FLRA 869, 880 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222,</span> 54 FLRA 1267, 1275-76 (1998)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that its decision to use term employees to fill the dam Operator positions constitutes a matter that is negotiable only at the election of the Agency under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. According to the Agency, because the substance of its decision to use term employees is negotiable only at the election of the Agency, any duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of its decision is likewise negotiable only at the election of the Agency. Contrary to the Agency's claim, however, it is well established that, even though an agency's exercise of its &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) right is permissive, impact and implementation bargaining over the exercise of that right is mandatory. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator relied on <span class="Italic">FAA</span> to conclude that he did not have jurisdiction to hear a grievance filed by the <span class="Italic">charged</span> party[9] that alleged the <span class="Italic">charging</span> party breached the settlement agreement. But, that is not what <span class="Italic">FAA</span> held. <span class="Italic">FAA</span> did not address whether a charged party could allege a breach of a settlement agreement by the charging party through the parties' grievance procedure. Instead, <span class="Italic">FAA</span> addressed breaches by the charged party where the GC was a signatory to the settlement. In those circumstances, we determined a violation of a settlement agreement would not be a violation of sections 7116(a)(5) or 7116(b)(5) of the Federal Service Labor&#8209;Management Relations Statute (the Statute).[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 43 FLRA at 1231. We note the 1992 decision cited 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.11(b)(1) of the Authority's Regulations. That section is found currently at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.12(a) and it provides no relief for any <span class="Italic">charged</span> party who claims the <span class="Italic">charging</span> party has failed to perform its obligations under the approved informal settlement agreement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.12(a) ("If the <span class="Italic">Charged</span> Party fails to perform its obligations under the approved informal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may institute further proceedings." (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even in the furthest dicta of <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, we did not opine on the appropriate forum for a grievance filed by the charged party. Quite the opposite, we discussed that there are regulations that provide for the Regional Director, and then the GC, to proceed with the adjudication of the <span class="Italic">charging</span> party's underlying unfair labor practice charge, or complaint, should the settlement agreement have been breached by the <span class="Italic">charged</span> party.[12] Both <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, and our current regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.12(a), are silent as to the appropriate forum when the charged party alleges the <span class="Italic">charging</span> party failed to abide by the settlement agreement. Moreover, both <span class="Italic">FAA</span> and &#x00A7; 2423.12(a) of the Authority's Regulations concern the violation of a settlement agreement that has been "approved by" a Regional Director of the Office of the GC.[13] Here, there is no record evidence that the Regional Director either approved, or was a party to, the parties' settlement agreement. Thus, <span class="Italic">FAA</span> and &#x00A7; 2423.12 are entirely inapplicable and cannot possibly have deprived the Arbitrator of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA declined to set aside an arbitrator's award reducing a disciplinary sanction on the argument of the agency that the arbitrator improperly admitted evidence of a grievance settlement concerning discipline of a similarly situated employee. The arbitrator was not required to strictly apply or to construe rules of evidence. The agency's exception was based on no more than general considerations of public interests, insufficient to show that the award was contrary to public policy. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 32 FLRA 765, 769-70 (1988).
