<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-416"><span id="Page_815"></span><span class="space">c.</span> Likelihood Issues Will Be Addressed in a Different MSPB Appeal or a Different Forum</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Regulation implementation review is undertaken following Board consideration of "the likelihood that a given issue will be reached in a timely fashion through ordinary channels of appeal, the availability of other equivalent remedies, the extent of the regulation's application to the Federal service, and the strength of the arguments against the validity of its implementation." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDiarmid v. Fish and Wildlife Serv.</span>, 19 MSPR 347, 349, 23 MSPB 420 (1984) (challenge to agency implementation of performance appraisal system). After <span class="Italic">McDiarmid,</span> the Board limited the likelihood of review of some regulation implementation cases in <span class="Italic">National Council of Field Assessment Locals v. DHHS, SSA</span>, 31 MSPR 590, 591 (1986). As to challenged performance standards, the Board determined that if the validity of a regulation can or will reach the Board through ordinary channels of appellate jurisdiction, the validity of regulations will not be reviewed under the Board's extraordinary, but limited, jurisdiction under 5 USC 1205(e) [now &#x00A7; 1205(f)] . <span class="Italic">AFGE v. SSA</span>, 31 MSPR 590 (1986). If an issue raised in a regulation review request was addressed in prior litigation involving a different type of appeal, the Board is not likely to consider the matter under the regulation review process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Potter v. OPM</span>, 118 MSPR 587, 589-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11, 2012 MSPB 102 (2012) (challenge to guidance in the OPM VetGuide concerning time-in-grade requirements for VEOA consideration was an issue previously adjudicated by the Board); <span class="Italic">Lynch v. OPM</span>, 115 MSPR 480, 485 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 2 (2011) (validity of an OPM regulation defining "preference eligible," 5 CFR 211.102(c) [now 5 CFR 211.102(d)] was earlier addressed in appellant's VEOA case). <span class="Italic">Asatov v. OPM,</span> CB-1205-15-0039-U-1 (NP 5/6/2016), expressed the Board's preference for adjudication under alternate, effective remedies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board's authority to grant a petition for regulation review is discretionary, and the Board has established prudential criteria for declining to exercise its discretion. <span class="Italic">See McDiarmid v. U.S. Fish &#x0026; Wildlife Service,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 347, 349 (1984). Two of these criteria provide a clear basis for denying review of the petitioner's challenge to the agency's implementation of these regulations: the likelihood that a given issue will be reached in a timely fashion through ordinary channels of review and the availability of other equivalent remedies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The petitioner in fact has already filed another Board appeal under the Veterans' Employment Opportunity Act in which he challenged the same nonselection by AID in dispute here and in which he raised the same issue, whether the agency's action violated the pass over requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b). Thus, the issue raised was actually addressed, and had the petitioner prevailed he could have obtained any remedy available in a regulation review proceeding. Accordingly, the Board finds it appropriate to exercise its discretion not to review the petitioner's invalid implementation claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's reluctance to use regulation review or regulation implementation review to reach issues that may be addressed through more traditional appeals is expressed in a variety of cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 86, 89-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2004) (availability of, despite the possible unsuccessful resort to, VEOA and USERRA appeals led the Board to decline to consider through regulation or implementation proceedings claimed violations of regulations pertaining to the use of veterans preference or military experience in making an appointment to a federal position); <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">In re Implementation of 5 CFR Part 430</span>, 35 MSPR 146, 147-49 (1987), confirmed curtailment of regulatory implementation review, declining review of allegedly arbitrary performance standards:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's <span class="Italic">McDiarmid</span> [19 MSPR 347, 23 MSPB 420 (1984)] analysis is founded upon its recognition that striking down the implementation of regulations can be an extremely intrusive remedy. It combines aspects of class action and injunctive relief, and must be judiciously applied. Consideration of whether the government or its employees will be irreparably harmed by the Board action on a petition is, therefore, appropriate. This is especially so here, where we are asked to overturn significant portions of the agency's performance appraisal system, an action which would have broad impact on the agency and its employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the issues raised in a...petition can be reached by the Board through the ordinary channels of appeal, there is no irreparable harm to possibly affected employees in denying a petition for regulation review. Moreover, given the breadth and finality of the relief which is available in a regulation review proceeding, it is preferable for the Board not to issue such sweeping rulings on important matters in abstract cases. Our ability to issue a fully informed and well reasoned decision is significantly increased when the issues are presented to the Board in a case with a fully developed record. That type of record can more easily be prepared in the context of a Chapter 43 or Chapter 75 appeal where adversarial parties have had the opportunity to engage in pretrial discovery and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in considering whether or not to grant a petitioner's request, the Board, aware of the substantial impact of such decisions and of the dangers inherent in deciding issues in the absence of concrete, fact-specific controversies, must also consider the potential harm that a precipitous ruling might have on the government and the public. Just as federal courts must evaluate the possible effects on the public interest in deciding whether to grant or deny injunctive relief, it is appropriate for the Board to consider comparable public policy concerns in deciding how it should rule upon petitions for review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board may also consider the ability of the petitioner to represent adequately the interests of all the employees who could be affected by the Board's ruling. In making rulings on petitions...it is appropriate for the Board to take into account the same due process considerations relating to the need for adequate protection of the interests of absent individuals which underlie the adequacy of representation requirement contained in the class action provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.... Based on the submission of the petitioner here, we have no reason to conclude that it could not adequately represent the interests involved. However, in light of the fact that review is not appropriate for the reasons already discussed, this factor is not determinative.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">NTEU v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 244, 249-52 (1997), announced that, although the regulation challenged was not invalid, the regulation review process was appropriately invoked to challenge OPM regulations conferring service credit in RIFs for certain levels of performance appraisals. NTEU challenged the regulation as requiring the commission of a prohibited personnel practice to the extent the regulation conferred service credit for work performed in positions having no relationship to the position sought in RIF competition. Ordinary appellate channels were insufficient because "the remedies they provide are after the fact":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has identified several considerations as relevant in deciding whether to exercise its discretion to review an OPM regulation: the likelihood that the issue will be timely reached through ordinary channels of appeal, the availability of other equivalent remedies, the extent of the regulation's application, and the strength of the arguments against its validity<span class="Italic">. Senior Executives Association v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 67 MSPR 643, 648 (1995), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 113 F.3d 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table); <span class="Italic">McDiarmid v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</span>, 19 MSPR 347, 349 (1984). The challenged regulation has broad application since it governs RIF retention standing government wide, but OPM asserts that this fact does not support granting review because the feature of the regulation to which petitioner objects will often not be a factor in a particular RIF action. While this may well be the case, it is still plain that the regulation's provision concerning crediting of performance is one which is likely to have extensive application in agency RIF's.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also points out that an employee affected by the regulation can challenge it through an appeal to the Board or a bargaining agreement grievance, both of which proceedings can provide the employee an effective remedy should the regulation be found invalid. However, when the timing of other remedies is considered in a larger perspective, we believe that this factor supports granting NTEU's request. As petitioner points out, ordinary channels of appeal do not provide the most efficient method of resolving the legal issue presented here because the remedies they provide are after the fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A RIF regulation which is illegal affects not only the employee directly affected, but other employees of the agency who are undergoing the RIF because each employee's rights are determined in relation to those of others. If the Board were to require employees to challenge the regulation in individual RIF appeals and should then invalidate the regulation, providing an effective remedy at that point would result in greater disruption than would a remedy in this review proceeding. Agencies would likely be required to reconstruct retention registers and redo already implemented RIF's, and they could incur liability for back pay to employees previously wrongfully released. For the Board to decline review here because of the availability of individual remedies would ignore the statutory propose of permitting it to review OPM regulations directly in order to "avoid[ ] the necessity for multiple proceedings to correct abuses that have a common source." <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPR 208, 247 (1979). The issue raised by petitioner is a purely legal one well suited to adjudication in a regulation review proceeding, and there is every reason to resolve it in advance of agency RIF's, which can be expected to increase in number in a time of widespread efforts towards downsizing of the federal government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM asserts that NTEU's challenge to the regulation on its face must fail because there are admittedly proper applications of the regulation, i.e., in many cases the employee's prior performance will have been in the same or a related position and retention credit for it will not be unlawful under NTEU's theory. For its assertion that a facial challenge under section 1204(f)(2)(A) must establish that there is no set of circumstances under which the regulation would be valid, OPM cites cases addressing constitutional review of Congressional legislation. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States v. Salento,</span> 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 2100, 95 L. Ed.2d 697 (1987). However, the rule that courts should not strike down a statute on its face unless it is invalid in every application is based upon the proper role of the judiciary in the constitutional scheme and the principle that a court should avoid invalidating more of a statute than is necessary to address the constitutional issues in the case before it<span class="Italic">. See Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.,</span> 472 U.S. 491, 501-02, 105 S. Ct. 2794, 2800-01, 86 L. Ed.2d 394 (1985); <span class="Italic">United States v. Raines,</span> 362 U.S. 17, 21-22, 80 S. Ct. 519, 522-23, 4 L. Ed.2d 524 (1960). This constitutional jurisprudence is not relevant to a determination of the Board's authority under section 1204(f)(2)(A), which depends on the intent of Congress when it enacted the statute. In any event, NTEU is not requesting the Board to invalidate section 351.504(b)(1) in every application but only to the extent that it entitles employees to additional service credits on the basis of performance ratings in positions unrelated to the position for which they are competing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, to the extent that OPM is contending that a regulation cannot be invalid on its face unless it requires a prohibited personnel practice in every application, the Board has previously rejected such an interpretation. In <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris,</span> the Board ruled that an OPM regulation "requires" a violation of section 2302 within the meaning of the statute if it is reasonably foreseeable that it will result in a prohibited personnel practice. The Board determined that the statutory purpose and the legislative history demonstrate that "a narrow interpretation in the sense of a literally imperative or mandatory command" should not be given to the statutory terms "require" and "has required." A more restrictive interpretation would subvert Congressional intent because it would permit OPM to avoid entirely the Board's review authority by the skillful use of permissive or precatory language. A broader interpretation, the Board found, was consistent with the statement of a sponsor of the amendment which added this provision that it authorizes the Board to eliminate any rule or regulation which would result in prohibited personnel practices if implemented. The interpretation advanced by OPM would be inconsistent with the Board's intended ability to prevent reasonably foreseeable illegal action from occurring. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPB 199, 1 MSPR at 246-47.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 184, 191 &#x00B6; 11 (2000) (to decline regulation review because of the availability of individual remedies would ignore the statutory purpose of permitting regulation review to avoid the necessity of multiple proceedings to correct abuses having a common source).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal has already been pursued to reach an issue later raised through implementation or regulation review, there may be a <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> issue.
