<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-7"><span class="space">c.</span> Decision Remanding Case to Judge</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, 571 F.3d 1359, 1361-63 (Fed. Cir. 2009), invoked the "final judgment" rule to preclude review of a Board order remanding to the AJ a merits determination on a VEOA selection claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold matter, we are called upon in this case to exercise our "special obligation" to satisfy ourselves of our own jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist.</span>, 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986). One constraint on this court's jurisdiction is the "so-called 'final judgment rule,' [which] ordinarily limits our jurisdiction to appeals from a decision or order that 'ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.'" <span class="Italic">Allen v. Principi</span>, 237 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Firestone Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co. v. Risjord</span>, 449 U.S. 368, 373 (1981)). "The requirement of finality has been called 'an historic characteristic of federal appellate procedure.'" <span class="Italic">Cabot Corp. v. United States</span>, 788 F.2d 1539, 1542 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (quoting <span class="Italic">Flanagan v. United States</span>, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that the final judgment rule applies to appeals from the Merit Systems Protection Board. "Section 1295(a)(9) of Title 28 circumscribes our jurisdiction to review the Board's decisions, limiting it to jurisdiction over 'an appeal from a final order or final decision of the' Board." <span class="Italic">Haines v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 44 F.3d 998, 999 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (2006) (conferring jurisdiction over "an appeal from a <span class="Italic">final order or final decision</span> of the Merit Systems Protection Board, pursuant to sections 7703(b)(1) and 7703(d) of title 5" (emphasis added)); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) (2006) ("[A] petition to review a <span class="Italic">final order or final decision</span> of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit." (emphasis added)). "Our jurisdiction over [a] petition, then, turns on whether the [determination that the petitioner seeks to appeal] constitutes a 'final order or final decision' for purposes of section 1295(a)(9)." <span class="Italic">Haines</span>, 44 F.3d at 999-1000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The Supreme Court has consistently held that as a general rule an order is final only when it 'ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute [the] judgment.'" <span class="Italic">Cabot</span>, 788 F.2d at 1542 (quoting <span class="Italic">Firestone</span>, 449 U.S. at 373). In the particular context of determinations by the Board, we have held that "we look to the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113 to determine what constitutes a 'final order' for jurisdictional purposes." <span class="Italic">Haines</span>, 44 F.3d at 1000. That regulation provides in relevant part that, "[i]f the Board grants a petition for review or a cross petition for review, or reopens or dismisses a case, the decision of the Board is final <span class="Italic">if it disposes of the entire action</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(c) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board granted the Agency's petition for review and reversed the determination of the administrative judge concerning willfulness, but then forwarded Weed's petition to its field office for "further adjudication." <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. at 144, 148. Because that decision required that the field office conduct "further adjudication," it did not "leave[&#8197;] nothing for the court to do but execute [the] judgment" and it did not "dispose[&#8197;] of the entire action." Rather, the Board's decision in this case was, in essence, a remand to the field office for adjudication in the first instance of Weed's challenge to the reconstruction process. As such, it was not a "final order or final decision" for purposes of &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case provides a strong illustration of the important purpose of the final judgment rule. As the Supreme Court has said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The final judgment rule... helps preserve the respect due trial judges by minimizing appellate-court interference with the numerous decisions they must make in the pre-judgment stages of litigation. It reduces the ability of litigants to harass opponents and to clog the courts through a succession of costly and time-consuming appeals. It is crucial to the efficient administration of justice. For these reasons, this Court has long held that the policy of Congress embodied in [the final judgment rule] is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions which do not terminate the litigation... .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Flanagan</span>, 465 U.S. at 263-64 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Weed asks this court to reverse the Board's determination that the Agency did not willfully violate his veterans' preference rights, and to authorize the award of liquidated damages for a willful violation. But as the administrative judge stated, and as Weed himself concedes, Weed cannot be entitled to liquidated damages for a willful violation unless, following the reconstruction process, the Agency determines that Weed would have been hired had the Agency afforded him veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See A.J. Op.</span> at 8 ("At this point, it has yet to be determined whether the appellant is entitled to appointment to the position or whether he is entitled to back pay and, therefore, an award of liquidated damages is not appropriate at this time."); Oral Arg. at 4:31-42, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-3112.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/mp3/2008-3112.mp3</a> (June 1, 2009) (counsel for Weed agreeing that "any entitlement to liquidated damages would be contingent on his success in the restructured hire"). Though the record is not clear, it appears that the Agency and the Board have yet to reach any final determination as to whether Weed would or would not have been hired in a properly reconstructed selection process. An appeal concerning the availability of liquidated damages for a willful violation--while litigation continues at the Board level concerning whether there was any violation at all--is precisely the kind of "piecemeal appellate review" that the final judgment rule is designed to prevent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the decision of the Board on appeal is not a "final order or final decision" for purposes of &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). Neither Weed nor the Agency has argued that any exception to the final judgment rule applies, and, in fact, Weed concedes that he knows of nothing that would foreclose him from appealing the issue of willful violation once the judgment of the Board is final. We therefore conclude that we lack jurisdiction over Weed's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weed</span> was relied on in <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 876 F.3d 1106, 1109-1111 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our jurisdiction over petitions for review of orders of the Merit Systems Protection Board appeals derives from 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). That statute provides that this court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal "from a final order or final decision" of the Board. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A) ("[A] petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit."). Our jurisdiction over a petition therefore turns on whether the determination that the petitioner seeks to appeal "constitutes a 'final order or final decision' for purposes of section 1295(a)(9)." <span class="Italic">Weed v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory requirement that we limit our review to "final" orders and decisions of the Board parallels the familiar "final judgment rule" in appellate proceedings, which is aimed at curbing "piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions which do not terminate the litigation." <span class="Italic">United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co.,</span> 458 U.S. 263, 265 (1982). As a general rule, an order is final only when it "ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment." <span class="Italic">Catlin v. United States,</span> 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same policy underlies the principle that "an order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not final." <span class="Italic">Cabot Corp. v.

Wright <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 3914.32, at 237-38 (2d ed. 2006) ("The general rule is that a remand is not appealable as a final decision... . Since the remand is not final, it can be reviewed on appeal from the eventual final disposition... .").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has remanded the case for further proceedings, we look to whether the agency has required further administrative adjudication; we do not base our decision on whether the agency has formally denominated its action as a "remand." If the agency's order contemplates further adjudication or other proceedings beyond the ministerial implementation of the agency's directive, the order will be treated as a remand. <span class="Italic">See Weed,</span> 571 F.3d at 1362 (dismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction where the Board's decision was "in essence[&#8197;] a remand" because it forwarded the petition to the Board's regional office for "further adjudication" and ordered the Social Security Administration to reconstruct the hiring process for the position for which the petitioner had applied); <span class="Italic">Cummings v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 500 Fed. Appx. 941, 944 (Fed.

Given <span id="Page_5165"></span>that proceedings continue in [the agency], the MSPB's decision was not 'final' because it failed to dispose of the 'entire action.' We therefore lack jurisdiction over Mr. Cummings' appeal at this time." (internal citation omitted)).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Morrison argues that the Board's order was final because the Board denominated its decision as its "final order." The Board's characterization of its order does not, however, govern our jurisdiction under our jurisdictional statutes. In the <span class="Italic">Weed</span> case, for example, the Board characterized its order as a "final decision," <span class="Italic">see Weed v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 142, 149 (2007), but we nonetheless held that the Board's action was not final for purposes of our jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Weed,</span> 571 F.3d at 1361.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board concluded that Mr. Morrison's retirement was involuntary and that he should be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the Board did not "dispos[e] of [the] entire action." <span class="Italic">Haines,</span> 44 F.3d at 1000. Rather, the Board stated that, to ascertain the appropriate relief, "the agency [must] first determine if and when [Mr. Morrison] would have been removed had he not retired." The Board then outlined various potential outcomes, depending on how the Navy ultimately decided that question. Because it is not the case that the Board's decision left "nothing for the [agency] to do but execute judgment," the Board's ruling was not a final order or decision, and we lack jurisdiction over the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Cabot,</span> 788 F.2d at 1543 (an order seeking "additional findings, determination, and redetermination" from the agency is not final for purposes of appellate review); <span class="Italic">see also Gingery v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 392 Fed. Appx. 855, 856 (Fed.

'an order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not final.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Cabot,</span> 788 F.2d at 1542)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Morrison argues that the Board merely sent this case back to the Navy to implement and comply with the Board's decision, not to conduct any further proceedings. We disagree. As the Board's opinion makes clear, the Board required the Navy to decide, in the first instance, whether and when Mr. Morrison would have been terminated if he had not retired. That was the critical modification that the Board made to the initial decision, in which the administrative judge had ruled that Mr. Morrison "would have been separated effective July 13, 2012." The Board directed that such a determination had to be made by the agency.[3] As such, the Board's decision was not final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), and we therefore dismiss the petition without reaching the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Mr. Morrison suggests that on remand the agency was virtually certain to decide that he would have been removed as of July 13, 2012, and that subsequent events have proved that to be true. But our jurisdiction cannot turn on a party's estimate of the probability of losing on remand. And the fact that there has been a decision by the agency on remand, which has been appealed to the Board, is a further indication that it is not this appeal, but the subsequent one, which includes the full record of the remand proceedings, that is the proper vehicle for determining whether Mr. Morrison is entitled to back pay for any or all of the period between July 13, 2012, and his mandatory retirement date in June 2014.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, for a lack of a Board final order, an appeal by an individual whose case was remanded to the agency for reconstruction of a selection action initially conducted in violation of VEOA; the appeal was premature because the controversy was not fully determined by the Board, <span class="Italic">Schoenrogge v. DOJ</span>, 385 Fed. Appx. 996, 998 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... Our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) extends only to "appeal[s] from a final order or a final decision of the Board." <span class="Italic">Weed v. Soc.

We have held that the final judgment rule applies to appeals from the MSPB, and that under the Board's regulations, "[i]f the Board grants a petition for review or a cross petition for review, or reopens or dismisses a case, the decision of the Board is final <span class="Italic">if it disposes of the entire action</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(c).

Where a decision of the Board requires that the agency conduct further proceedings, we have held that such a decision is not final for jurisdictional purposes as it does not "leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment" and does not "dispose of the entire action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362 (alterations omitted). In particular, in <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, we remarked that where the Board remands a case to an agency to "reconstruct the selection process," a petitioner's request for review to this court is "premature." 587 F.3d at 1315; <span class="Italic">see also Patterson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 111 Fed. Appx. 590, 593 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Schoenrogge sought review of the Board's decision ordering the agency to reconstruct the selection process. Because the Board's February 17, 2010, decision effectively remanded to the agency for further adjudication, it was not a final decision for jurisdictional purposes.
