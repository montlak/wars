<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-108"><span class="space">d.</span> Lack of Proper Notice From OPM Concerning Annuity Election</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM is supposed to notify retirees on an annual basis of their options to establish or increase a survivor annuity. The notice does not always get through. Deadlines are missed and appeals result when survivor annuity benefits are denied by OPM. Under <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. OPM</span>, 118 MSPR 678, 681 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2012 MSPB 128 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRS, the surviving spouse of a retired federal employee is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the retiree's annuity unless the survivor consented in writing to receive no such survivor annuity or a reduced annuity at the time of the employee's retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), 8341(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Luten</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 10; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614. A retiree may, within 18 months after retirement, choose to elect a survivor annuity for the spouse to whom he was married at retirement if he did not previously do so or to increase the size of such an annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(o)(1); <span class="Italic">Nunes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2009); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has a statutory obligation to notify annuitants annually that they have 18 months after retirement to provide or increase a spouse's survivor annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(o)(6). When OPM fails to show that it complied with the statutory notice requirements and "the annuitant's conduct is consistent with his having made the election at issue," survivor benefits have been ordered as if the deceased had made a timely election. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 347 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 318 F.3d 1127, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Wood v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 241 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM bears the burden of proving that it sent the notice. <span class="Italic">Nunes</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 20. OPM may establish by preponderant evidence that it sent the notice by submitting the affidavit of the OPM official responsible for printing and distributing retirement forms and notices. If OPM can establish through credible evidence that it is more probable than not that it sent the notice, the burden of going forward falls upon the appellant, who must put forth credible testimony or other evidence tending to support her contention that the annuitant did not receive the notice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge must then decide whether to credit the appellant's evidence of non-receipt and whether such evidence overcomes the presumption that the annuitant received the notice. <span class="Italic">See Reynolds v. Department of Justice</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 189, 193, <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 36 F.3d 1112 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Stracquatanio v. Walkama</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1992) (a letter properly addressed, stamped, and mailed is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined that if OPM misinforms a divorced annuitant concerning the proper means for electing a former spouse annuity, and if there is evidence that the annuitant intended to establish the annuity for the former spouse, OPM must grant the annuity, <span class="Italic">Wood v. OPM</span>, 241 F.3d 1364, 1366-68 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Wood asserts that OPM failed to satisfy the statutory requirement to notify Mr. Wood of his election options, and that this failure, combined with evidence of his intent in the form of his letter and continued acceptance of reduced annuity benefits, entitles her to the annuity. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute clearly requires notice of election rights to the affected employee. Section 8339 note provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall, on an annual basis, inform each annuitant of such annuitant's rights of election under sections 8339(j) and 8339(k)(2) of Title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. 8339 note; <span class="Italic">see also Brush v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (holding that the "plain meaning of this provision [5 U.S.C. 8339 note] is that the annual notice is mandatory").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have twice held that, if the required notice is not provided, OPM cannot deny the annuity even if formal election has not been made during the applicable time period, so long as there is some evidence that the employee wished his former spouse to receive the annuity. <span class="Italic">See Vallee v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 58 F.3d 613, 615-16 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1562. In another case, <span class="Italic">Holder v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 47 F.3d 412, 415 (Fed. Cir. 19995), we held that the notice provided was adequate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this appeal, the government argues that Mr. Wood was statutorily required to file an election of a former spouse annuity within two years following entry of the divorce decree on December 30, 1986, and that his letter dated August 20, 1986, was insufficient because it was sent before his divorce became final. We do not reach the question of the adequacy of Mr. Wood's letter to serve as a formal election because we find that the government failed to provide adequate notice. The letter received by Mr. Wood from OPM in September of 1986 made no mention of a requirement that he make an election after the divorce. That letter simply listed the three ways in which Mrs. Wood could receive a former spouse survivor annuity, and one of them, without further explanation, was Mr. Wood's ability to "voluntarily elect to provide survivor coverage for an ex-spouse." Nor did the letter inform Mr. Wood that his continued receipt of a reduced annuity would not suffice to constitute an election. Under these circumstances, Mr. Wood could have reasonably believed that his August 20, 1986, letter to OPM had already elected a former spouse survivor annuity for Mrs. Wood, and that he was not required to do anything else to provide Mrs. Wood with that annuity. Under <span class="Italic">Brush</span> and <span class="Italic">Vallee</span> the September 1986, notice was plainly inadequate. Indeed, this very issue was addressed in <span class="Italic">Vallee</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he notice form that was sent to Mr. Vallee in 1984 and 1986 was silent on the need to make an election under the Spouse Equity Act. Nor did the notice form state that no survivor annuity would be paid to his divorced spouse even if he continued to reduce his own annuity.&#8197;...As the court held in <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> the OPM was under an affirmative statutory duty to provide the requisite information to annuitants. That duty was not met as to Mr. Vallee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Vallee,</span> 58 F.3d at 615-16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that here the December 1987 notice from OPM set forth the election requirements; that <span class="Italic">Holder</span> held that this form of notice, standing alone, was adequate, 47 F.3d at 415; and that the December 1987 notice may have been the first notice required by the statute. But this case is quite different from <span class="Italic">Holder.</span> In <span class="Italic">Holder</span> this court did not find that before and during the election period, Mr. Holder had received confusing notices. Rather in <span class="Italic">Holder</span> a compliant notice was sent during the election period, and the supposedly confusing notices were sent <span class="Italic">after</span> the election period, and thus could not have affected the election decision. Here, in September 1986, immediately <span class="Italic">before</span> the election period, the government sent Mr. Wood a most confusing notice, and we hold that, having done so, it was not enough that OPM sent him a compliant notice at a later time during the election period (in December 1987), particularly since that compliant notice was itself hardly a model of clarity, and did little to correct the earlier confusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By our reliance on the misleading nature of OPM's September 1986 response to Mr. Wood's letter of inquiry, we do not mean to suggest that the mere fact that a federal agency gives misleading information to an applicant for benefits about the statutory or regulatory restrictions on the availability of those benefits is sufficient to waive those restrictions. The Supreme Court has held that the government is not generally subject to estoppel or a waiver of restrictions on eligibility for benefits even when the applicant is given misleading information that results in prejudicing his efforts to obtain the benefits. <span class="Italic">See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414 (1990). Congress, however, has specifically directed OPM to inform annuitants on an annual basis of their rights to elect survivor annuities for former spouses, and this court has held, reasonably enough, that a statutory directive to provide such information means that the information must be correct and not misleading. It is not a significant extension of that principle to hold that OPM is required to provide accurate information to annuitants not only in the document that is denominated the annual notice of election rights, but in any other earlier document OPM provides to annuitants on that subject so that the statutorily-required notice is not diluted or contradicted. Because of the misleading September 1986 letter, the principles of <span class="Italic">Brush</span> and <span class="Italic">Vallee</span> are fully applicable here, and <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> does not compel rejection of Mrs. Wood's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It remains only to be determined whether Mr. Wood adequately manifested his intention that his former spouse receive the annuity. We hold that he did. As this court noted in <span class="Italic">Vallee,</span> "in order to authorize payment of the survivor annuity in these circumstances (where the retiree is now dead), there must be evidence sufficient to show that the retiree indeed intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse." 58 F.3d at 616; <span class="Italic">see also Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1562 ("Every indication in the record here compels the conclusion that Brush affirmatively desired the annuity for Mrs. Brush.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4225"></span>Here, there is clear evidence that Mr. Wood intended to provide the survivor annuity for Mrs. Wood. After divorce, Mr. Wood continued to receive a reduced annuity. When OPM notified him of his right to have his annuity restored to its full value after the divorce in 1986, Mr. Wood declined to do so. In both Brush and Vallee, this court found that an employee's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity following divorce, standing alone, adequately demonstrated that employee's intent to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse. <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1562 (noting that the divorced employee continued to receive the reduced annuity "over a period of two years after his own self interest could have dictated a change, if he had so desired"); <span class="Italic">Vallee,</span> 58 F.3d at 616 (emphasizing the employee's decision to forego restoration of the full value of the annuity). Moreover, in his August 20, 1986, letter to OPM, Mr. Wood informed that agency that he wished for Mrs. Wood to receive the survivor annuity following their divorce. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Mr. Wood adequately manifested his intention that Mrs. Wood receive the survivor annuity following his death.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After its decision in <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> in <span class="Italic">Hairston v. OPM</span>, 318 F.3d 1127, 1130-31 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the Federal Circuit again remanded with instructions to MSPB ensure processing of a former spouse annuity when the annuitant's intent to do so appeared clear through the continued receipt of a reduced annuity, but the notice of election rights received from OPM after divorce was unclear, and the divorce decree only split the lifetime annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board correctly determined that the evidence of record proves that Mr. Hairston intended to provide Ms. Hairston a survivor annuity. Mr. Hairston, upon retirement, elected to provide Ms. Hairston a survivor annuity. Subsequent to the divorce, Mr. Hairston continued to receive a reduced annuity payment and never requested that this annuity be restored. The government does not contest this finding of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the only issue remaining is whether the first relevant notice received by Mr. Hairston was confusing and therefore ineffective. To resolve this issue it is necessary to examine the facts relating to the various notices received by Mr. Hairston and the timing of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court entered a judgment of dissolution of marriage on September 12, 1984, but the final judgment of dissolution was not entered until March 18, 1987. In December 1986, prior to the final judgment of dissolution, Mr. Hairston received the first form notice advising him of his right to elect to provide a former spouse survivor annuity. Shortly after the divorce became final, Mr. Hairston received a notice from OPM with respect to OPM's intention to honor the divorce decree and divide his pension equally with Ms. Hairston. Noticeably absent from this notice was any notification of the need to affirmatively elect to provide Ms. Hairston with a former spouse survivor annuity. For the reasons discussed in <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> we hold that this first notice received after the divorce became final was confusing and therefore ineffective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of this holding we do not consider the suitability of the notice sent to Mr. Hairston in 1986 because it was prior to the final judgment of dissolution. It is the first notice received after the finalization of the divorce that is critical because it is at that point at which the employee's election rights to provide a former spouse annuity begin. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3) ("An election under this paragraph shall be made...within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee...is dissolved."). Under California law, the entry of the final divorce decree "grants the divorce, dissolves the marriage, restores the parties to the status of single persons, and permits each to marry again." In re <span class="Italic">Estate of Seiler,</span> 164 Cal. 181, 182 (Cal. 1912); <span class="Italic">Adler v. Superior Court of Alameda County,</span> 187 Cal. App. 2d 207, 212 (Dist. Ct. App. 1960). The evidence of record shows that the final judgment of dissolution, giving rise to Mr. Hairston's election rights, was not entered until March 18, 1987. Thus, because the notice of December 1986 was prior to this final divorce decree, it is not relevant for the purpose of notification under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nixon v. OPM</span>, 452 F.3d 1361, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (OPM misled the annuitant by stating that he could not discontinue a survivor annuity for his former spouse, without providing a certificate showing her remarriage; "The requirement that Mr. Nixon submit proof of his former spouse's remarriage is predicated on the counterintuitive assumption that the relationship between former spouses is cooperative"; OPM should have itself made inquiry of the former spouse; if because of that error, the annuitant failed to make an election for a survivor annuity upon his own remarriage, the spouse at the time of the annuitant's death should receive a survivor annuity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cross v. OPM,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220124154">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), determined that OPM did not prove notice of a required annuity election. The court directed that an annuity be granted when the circumstances demonstrated that the retired employee desired continuation of a survivor annuity for his former spouse:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse of a deceased federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity under two circumstances: if (1) the annuity is expressly provided for in an affirmative election or a divorce or annulment decree, court order, or court-approved settlement agreement incident to such a decree, see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8445(a); or (2) "the statutorily required notice is ineffective; and [ ] the evidence shows that the employee...intended to provide a former spouse survivor annuity," <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 318 F.3d 1127, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see also Wood v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 241 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Vallee v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 58 F.3d 613, 615-16 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Brush v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, 1562-64 (Fed. Cir. 1992). It is undisputed that neither the Crosses' separation agreement nor their divorce decree expressly awards the survivor annuity benefit to Ms. Cross.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal therefore focuses on the second option available to Ms. Cross. Regarding intent, the Board found, and the Government does not challenge on appeal, that there is "no doubt that Mr. Cross did intend until his death that [Ms. Cross] would receive a former spouse survivor annuity based on his federal service." Accordingly, the dispositive question on appeal is whether OPM provided the statutorily required notice. For the reasons below, we conclude that the Board's finding that OPM provided notice to Mr. Cross is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM is "under a very clear and mandatory directive from Congress" to provide annual notice of annuity election rights to all annuitants. <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1563. "When a nonfrivolous allegation is made that OPM has not sent" the notice as required by statute, the burden of production falls to OPM to show, by "more than a bare allegation," that notice was sent and to offer proof of its contents. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1560-61. "OPM presumably has access to the pertinent records, as well as to the people who deal with those records," and this burden of production cannot be "upon the petitioner in the first instance to prove a negative." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1561. To meet this burden, OPM ordinarily submits "a sworn affidavit...attesting that general notices regarding survivor elections were mailed to all annuitants every December during the pertinent time period." Appx. 4 n.4; <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., DuBoise v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 363 F. App'x 35, 36-37 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the "agency provided no documentary evidence" to show that it provided the required notices annually. Appx. 4; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Oral Arg. at 17:36-43 ("OPM did not provide an affidavit in this case explaining that it provides annual notice."). The only evidence regarding notice in the proceedings before OPM and the Board was provided by Ms. Cross herself. That evidence was a single OPM notice "addressed to her former spouse, from December 2012, which she said [she] located in a ‘burn pile' after [Mr. Cross's] death." Appx. 4; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Oral Arg. at 17:53-17:59 (explaining that the only evidence is the "2012 notice that was provided to Mr. Cross that [Ms.] Cross turned over").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree that a single notice from 2012--found and produced by Ms. Cross--suffices as substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the statutorily required notice was provided annually to Mr. Cross. This single notice, dated 2012 and found in a "burn pile" in which documents would presumably be disposed of in a first in, first out order, is not substantial evidence to prove that Mr. Cross received annual notices subsequent to 2012. Therefore, the statutorily required notice was ineffective.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Simpson v. OPM</span>, 347 F.3d 1361, 1361-67 (Fed. Cir. 2003), essentially construed an election of a former spouse survivor annuity when OPM's election notices were unclear and when the annuitant continued to accept a reduced annuity after his divorce until his death:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carole Simpson appeals from the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board affirming the Office of Personnel Management's ("OPM's") denial of her application for a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 210, 2002 WL 1906866 (M.S.P.B. 2002) ("<span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>"). Because we hold that OPM failed as a matter of law to provide adequate notice to Mrs. Simpson's late ex-husband that he needed to take affirmative steps to provide her with a survivor annuity following their divorce, we conclude that the Board erred in finding that Mrs. Simpson is not entitled to receive the annuity. We accordingly reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carole and Harold Simpson were married in 1966. They separated in 1987. Upon his retirement from government service in 1988, Mr. Simpson elected reduced annuity benefits for himself and a survivor benefit for Mrs. Simpson. The couple were divorced in February 1993, amicably by all accounts, and Mr. Simpson continued to receive reduced benefits until his death in June 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In August 1994, Mrs. Simpson applied for the survivor annuity that Mr. Simpson had elected for her in 1988. OPM denied her application, stating that the election of survivor benefits had automatically terminated upon the couple's divorce, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A),[1] and that Mr. Simpson had neither reelected the survivor benefit within two years of the divorce nor provided for such a benefit in the couple's divorce decree, as required to reinstate the benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;That provision states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for the current spouse of a retired employee...shall be terminated for each full month--after the dissolution <span id="Page_4226"></span>of the spouse's marriage to the employee..., except that an appropriate reduction shall be made thereafter if the spouse is entitled, as a former spouse, to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Simpson requested reconsideration, and OPM upheld its decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Mrs. Simpson appealed to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on an affidavit from Mary Beth Smith-Toomey, the administrator of OPM's contract for printing and distribution of forms and notices, the Board's administrative judge ("AJ") found that OPM had sent standard notices to all annuitants each year from 1989 to 1994 and in 1996, with information concerning the right of an annuitant to make survivor elections. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 6. According to the AJ, Ms. Smith-Toomey's affidavit satisfied OPM's burden of showing that Mr. Simpson was notified of the need to make an election, and the burden then shifted to Mrs. Simpson to prove that Mr. Simpson did not receive the required notices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ credited and found persuasive affidavits from several of Mr. Simpson's friends and relatives, all of whom testified that Mr. Simpson would have wanted to elect a survivor benefit for Mrs. Simpson, irrespective of the couple's divorce. The AJ also credited testimony of Mrs. Simpson and the Simpsons' son that Mr. Simpson had been very careful concerning his financial records, keeping all bills, receipts, payments, and annuity checks for at least the seven years prior to his death, and yet that there was no evidence in his records of his having received a notice requiring reelection of benefits. Nonetheless, the AJ concluded that the petitioner had not met her burden, finding "it equally possible that [Mr.] Simpson provided for his former wife to the extent that he wanted to in [the Separation Agreement and his Last Will and Testament] and that he had no intention of providing a survivor annuity," despite what he told his friends and family; and also that it could be that Mr. Simpson only "kept all of the financial records on those matters upon which he acted, but that he did not keep documents on those matters wherein he took no action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Simpson raises three principal arguments on appeal. First, she contends that the government failed to meet its burden of proving that it actually sent the required notice to Mr. Simpson. Second, she argues that the Board erred in finding that the information allegedly provided to Mr. Simpson gave adequate notice that he needed to take affirmative steps to provide her with a survivor annuity following their divorce, notwithstanding his previous election. Finally, Mrs. Simpson asserts that Mr. Simpson's election to provide her with a survivor annuity prior to their divorce became irrevocably restated at the time of his death within the two-year period for making an election. Mrs. Simpson cites <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 982 F.2d 1554 (Fed. Cir. 1992), for the proposition that "[t]he accident of death, before that [statutory] period [for making an election] expired, terminated his ability to yea <span class="Italic">or</span> nay that election," and, thus, "the election he had made, in writing [at the time of his retirement] ,...in fact became irrevocably restated at the time of his death, which was within the two year period." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1558 n.11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds to Mrs. Simpson's first argument by arguing that, under this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 180 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999), Smith-Toomey's affidavit stating that annual notices were sent to all annuitants sufficed to meet the government's burden of establishing that an annual notice was sent to Mr. Simpson during the relevant period, and that the burden then shifted to the annuitant to come forward with evidence that the notice was not received. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1380-81. According to the government, the Board therefore properly ruled that Mr. Simpson was sent the required notices and that Mrs. Simpson failed to demonstrate that Mr. Simpson had not received them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to Mrs. Simpson's second argument, the government, citing this court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Holder v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 47 F.3d 412 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">Wood v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 241 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 318 F.3d 1127 (Fed. Cir. 2003), argues that the language of the annual notices sent by OPM has "been held to be generally sufficient to provide sufficient notice to an annuitant in the absence of some other OPM communication that might have confused the annuitant regarding his or her annuity election obligation following a divorce, even if the language is not a model of clarity." The government thus asserts that, "[b]ecause Mrs. Simpson could not rebut the record evidence that [Mr. Simpson] received OPM's notices, the MSPB properly concluded that Mr. Simpson was warned that he needed to take steps if he wanted to provide her a former spouse annuity."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the government responds to Mrs. Simpson's third argument that there is no precedent for holding that an annuitant who fails to make an election should be deemed to have done so if he or she dies prior to the expiration of the time period for making an election, and that, on the contrary, this court rejected similar arguments in <span class="Italic">Belanger v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 1 F.3d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1993), and <span class="Italic">Darsigny v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 787 F.2d 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The government further argues that <span class="Italic">Brush</span> can be distinguished on the ground that OPM had conceded in that case that it had not sent <span class="Italic">any</span> annual notices to the annuitant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Mrs. Simpson that OPM's notice was legally deficient in that it failed to adequately inform Mr. Simpson that, if he still intended that his former spouse receive an annuity, he must make a new election within two years of their divorce. Public Law 95-317, 92 Stat. 382 (1978), as amended by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978, &#x00A7; 102, 92 Stat. 3783 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note (1988)), states that "[t]he Director of the Office of Personal Management shall, on an annual basis, inform each annuitant of such annuitant's rights of election under sections 8339(j) and 8339(k)(2) of title 5, United States Code." In relevant part, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee...who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to have the annuity computed under subsections (a)-(i), (n), and (q) of this section or a portion thereof reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse....An election under this paragraph shall be made at the time of retirement or, if later, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is dissolved....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A] former spouse of a deceased employee...is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under section 8339(j)(3) of this title, or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These statutes provide that an employee may elect an annuity for a former spouse and that such an election must be made within two years after the marriage has been dissolved. A former spouse for whom such an election is made is entitled to an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's notices of record fail to comply with the statutory requirement of notice because an annuitant who elects an annuity for his (or her) spouse while married reasonably expects that he has complied with the statute sufficiently to cause the annuity to be paid on his death. At the time of his divorce, Mr. Simpson had already made an election. The problem was that he did not make that election after the divorce, and OPM's notice did not state that he had to do so again even if he had previously made such an election. Mr. Simpson had no reason to know that his election must be renewed following a divorce if he still intended that his former spouse receive the annuity. It is the statutory purpose of a notice to adequately inform an annuitant of the requirements that must be met for a spousal annuity to be provided. Thus, an annual notice is deficient when it fails to inform an annuitant that, even if he had previously elected a spousal annuity when married, he must make a new election after his divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brush</span> we held that "OPM must show two things when attempting to prove that it has met its burden of providing retirees with the notice here in issue. First, OPM must attempt to prove that the notice was actually sent....Second, OPM must offer proof as to the contents of the annual notice." 982 F.2d at 1561. We do agree with the government that the AJ's finding that a notice was sent to Mr. Simpson during the relevant time period was supported by substantial evidence. Smith-Toomey submitted an affidavit stating that a general notice was sent to all annuitants, including Mr. Simpson, each year, including, of special relevance here, in December 1993 (<span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> after the Simpsons' divorce). Moreover, we held in <span class="Italic">Schoemakers</span> that a similar affidavit, also from Smith-Toomey, satisfied the government's burden of establishing that notice was sent. 180 F.3d at 1380-81. Nonetheless, although Smith-Toomey's affidavit may have met the government's burden of showing that <span class="Italic">a</span> notice was sent to Simpson, there is no indication in the affidavit or anywhere else in the record that a notice was sent that informed Mr. Simpson that he needed to make a reelection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes four undated notices, all including a section entitled "Information and Reminder About Survivor Annuity Benefits," any or none of which might have been the notice that was actually sent to Simpson in 1993. No purpose would be served by quoting the notices in the record here, as the government's attorney conceded during oral argument that it is unknown which, if any, of the notices was sent, but that the actual notice would have likely been similar, if not identical, to the notices in the record. Each of the notices in the record is legally deficient, because none of them contains any statement that a pre-divorce election automatically terminates upon divorce and that an annuitant must make a new election to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse. That fact is not disputed by the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that <span class="Italic">Holder</span> supports its position. We do not agree. <span id="Page_4227"></span>We held in <span class="Italic">Holder</span> that a notice similar to a section of two of the notices in the present record had "reasonably informed [the annuitant] of his former spouse election rights," 47 F.3d at 415. This case is different from <span class="Italic">Holder,</span> however. It raises the question, not discussed in <span class="Italic">Holder,</span> whether an employee who makes an election for a spousal annuity was properly notified that he must make a <span class="Italic">reelection</span> after a divorce in order to provide such an annuity for a former spouse. <span class="Italic">Holder</span> dealt with the question whether OPM's notice informed Mr. Holder that he needed to make an election by a certain date following the implementation of a new regulation. The notice in <span class="Italic">Holder</span> was unequivocal, stating "`[s]uch an election must be filed in writing with the OPM no later than September 8, 1987.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We held that "[t]his language informed Mr. Holder that he was required to make an affirmative election with OPM by September 8, 1987 for Ms. Holder to receive a survivor annuity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the issue in <span class="Italic">Holder</span> was quite different from the issue here. The government's reliance on <span class="Italic">Hairston</span> is similarly deficient, as merely quoting and relying on <span class="Italic">Holder,</span> but also finding for the survivor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government also relies on <span class="Italic">Wood.</span> However, in <span class="Italic">Wood</span> we reversed a decision of the Board under circumstances similar to those at issue here. In that case, the annuitant, Mr. Wood, had written to OPM in August 1986 to ask whether or not his wife would still be entitled to previously elected survivor benefits if he divorced her and did not remarry. In response, OPM sent a letter identifying three ways in which the former spouse of a retired federal employee could obtain a former spouse survivor annuity. A hand-written note on the letter also stated that Mr. Wood should notify OPM if his marriage ever was terminated. The Woods' divorce decree issued in December 1986; Mr. Wood failed to notify OPM of that fact, but instead continued to receive a reduced annuity until his death in 1998. After her application for survivor benefits was denied by OPM, Mr. Wood's ex-wife appealed to the Board, which affirmed OPM's decision, and then to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reversing the Board's decision, we held that the letter sent to Mr. Wood was defective because it made no mention of a requirement that he make an election after the divorce, and it did not inform him that his continued receipt of a reduced annuity would not suffice to constitute an election. <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 241 F.3d at 1367. Under the circumstances, we concluded, Mr. Wood could have reasonably believed that he was not required to do anything else to provide his ex-wife with an annuity. Although annual notices similar to those approved in <span class="Italic">Holder</span> were also sent to Mr. Wood in December 1986 and December 1987, we distinguished <span class="Italic">Holder</span> on the basis of the confusing notices that had been sent to Mr. Wood before the election period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, although the annual notices sent to Mr. Simpson may have contained language similar to the December 1987 notice that we approved in <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> those notices were nonetheless defective for the following reason. The notices here have a section entitled "Events Which <span class="Italic">May</span> Increase Your Annuity" (emphasis added), which states that, "[i]f your annuity is now reduced to provide a survivor annuity[&#8197;] spouse, former spouse, or `insurable interest' beneficiary[&#8197;] reduction <span class="Italic">can</span> generally be eliminated if one of the following ev[er] occurs: Your marriage to your current spouse ends by death, divorc[e] annulment....Notify us in writing if any of the above events occurs...." (emphasis added). The language used in that section's title and corresponding text would reasonably lead an annuitant to conclude that his earlier election of a survivor annuity would remain in effect as long as he continued to accept a reduced annuity, but that he could optionally increase his annuity if his marriage ended. Thus, <span class="Italic">Wood</span> supports Mrs. Simpson more than it does the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, <span class="Italic">Brush</span> also supports Mrs. Simpson's appeal. In <span class="Italic">Brush</span> we held that "annual notice is mandatory," 982 F.2d at 1559, and observed that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board has previously recognized an implied exception to [the] election requirements...in section 8339(j). Where OPM fails to show that it has complied with the notice requirement under Pub.L. No. 95-317 and the annuitant's conduct is consistent with his having made the election at issue, the Board has either ordered OPM to allow the annuitant to make the election in issue or the Board has ordered OPM to grant the survivor benefits as if the deceased had made a timely election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1560. The latter course of action is appropriate in this case, because, as we noted in <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> "[i]n both <span class="Italic">Brush</span> and <span class="Italic">Vallee</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 58 F.3d 613 (Fed. Cir. 1995)], this court found that an employee's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity following divorce, standing alone, adequately demonstrated that employee's intent to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse." 241 F.3d at 1368; <span class="Italic">see also Hairston,</span> 318 F.3d at 1130 ("Evidence that the employee, upon retirement, elected to provide a spousal annuity, and after divorce declined to restore benefit payments or did not object to the continued discounted payment consistent with election of a spousal annuity is sufficient to prove the employee intended to provide a former spouse survivor annuity."). Moreover, regrettably, Mr. Simpson, being deceased, is no longer able to make a reelection himself. The Board is therefore instructed to order OPM to grant Mrs. Simpson the former spouse survivor annuity as if Mr. Simpson had made a timely reelection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we conclude that all of the notices of record are defective with respect to someone in Mr. Simpson's situation and that Mrs. Simpson was improperly denied a former spouse survivor annuity, we need not reach Mrs. Simpson's argument that her ex-husband's death within the two-year period after their divorce resulted in an unequivocal restatement of his pre-divorce election.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Simpson</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Dachniwskyj v. OPM</span>, 713 F.3d 99, 102-04 (Fed. Cir. 2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal employee who qualifies for a retirement annuity may elect to receive a reduced annuity during his lifetime to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse or former spouse if the annuitant predeceases the spouse or former spouse. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j). Divorce generally terminates a prior election of spousal survivor benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A)(ii). An annuitant who wishes to reinstate the survivor annuity for a former spouse following a divorce must re-elect a survivor annuity within two years of the divorce.[2] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.631(b)(5). Additionally, an annuitant who remarries after divorce may elect a survivor annuity for the new spouse within two years of remarriage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(C)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Alternatively, a divorce or annulment decree may require that the former spouse be awarded the survival annuity benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). No such provision was made in Myron and Theresa's divorce decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM is statutorily obligated to inform each annuitant annually of his right to elect a survivor annuity. Pub. L. No. 95-317, 92 Stat. 382 (1978) <span class="Italic">as amended by</span> Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978, &#x00A7; 102, 92 Stat. 3783 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note (1988)). When this notice is inadequate to inform the annuitant of his rights and obligations in electing a beneficiary for his survivor annuity "and the annuitant's conduct is consistent with his having made the election at issue," OPM should allow the annuitant to make the relevant election or, if the annuitant is deceased, grant the survivor benefits as if the deceased had made a timely election. <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 982 F.2d 1554, 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1992). For instance, this court has held that "[a] former spouse may receive survivor annuity benefits even without an affirmative election by the annuitant if (1) the annuitant did not receive the required notice, and (2) there is evidence sufficient to show that the retiree indeed intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse." <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 450 F.3d at 1334-35 (citations and quotations omitted). Where OPM fails to comply with the notice requirement, and there is evidence of the annuitant's intent, the Board has either ordered OPM to allow the annuitant to make the election outside the statutory time limits "'or grant the survivor benefits as if the deceased had made a timely election.'" <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 347 F.3d 1361, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">Brush</span>, 982 F.2d at 1560).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Simpson</span>, this court held that OPM's annual notice was insufficient to notify an annuitant of his rights and obligations with respect to electing a former spouse since it failed to inform the annuitant that a pre-divorce election is automatically terminated and he must make a new election to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse. 347 F.3d at 1364-65. Here, there is no dispute that the notices sent to Myron failed to inform him that his divorce voided his prior election of spousal survivor benefits. Accordingly, OPM's annual notice was inadequate to notify Myron of his rights and obligations with respect to electing his former spouse, Theresa, to receive the survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice was also insufficient to inform Myron of his rights and obligations with respect to electing his new spouse, Roksoliana, to receive the survivor annuity, and the Board erred in holding otherwise. The notice explains only that an annuitant may request a reduced annuity to provide survivor benefits for a spouse married before or after retirement within a specified period of time. The notice suffers from the same flaw recognized in <span class="Italic">Simpson</span>; it failed to inform Myron that his initial election was terminated by virtue of his divorce. Due to this failure, the notice was inadequate to inform Myron of the requirement to make a new election following his divorce from Theresa in order to provide a survivor annuity for his chosen beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, the notice was insufficient to notify Myron of his rights and obligations with respect to electing either his former spouse, Theresa, or his new spouse, Roksoliana. Accordingly, the next step is to consider evidence of Myron's intent and whether the Board's grant of benefits to Theresa is supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Brush</span>, 982 F.2d at 1560.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Simpson</span> the court determined that the annuitant's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity following a divorce, standing alone, adequately demonstrated the annuitant's intent to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse. 347 F.3d at 1367-68; <span class="Italic">see also Hairston v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 318 F.3d 1127, 1130-31 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, in <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, the court found that the annuitant's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity was insufficient in light of other evidence showing he <span id="Page_4228"></span>had taken affirmative steps to discontinue survival benefits for his former spouse after the divorce. 450 F.3d at 1335. The court stated that "[s]uch actions are fundamentally inconsistent with the intent to continue to provide such benefits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board found Myron had the intent to provide a survivor annuity to his former spouse, Theresa. In doing so, the Board improperly discounted the evidence and actions Myron took that demonstrate his intent to provide a survivor annuity for Roksoliana, not Theresa. The Board determined that the 2002 and 2006 communications between Myron and OPM "discussed <span class="Italic">replacing</span>" Theresa as the designated beneficiary with Roksoliana. <span class="Italic">Final Op</span>. at 3 (emphasis in original). The Board stated that "[t]here is only one document in the record that <span class="Italic">unconditionally</span> requests the appellant be <span class="Italic">removed</span> as beneficiary," but it "bears no date, does not indicate if there were additional pages that may have conditioned the request, and bears no proof that it was ever submitted to OPM." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis in original). The Board concluded that because it could not "confirm the veracity of this document, and [Myron] did not choose to submit this document to OPM, we cannot interpret it as an expression of his intent to unconditionally revoke his election of [Theresa] as his beneficiary." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reasoning is flawed. As noted above, it is true that "'an employee's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity following divorce, standing alone, adequately demonstrate[s] that employee's intent to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse.'" <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 450 F.3d at 1335 (quoting <span class="Italic">Wood v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 241 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001)) (alteration in original). Here, however, Myron's continued acceptance of a reduced annuity does not stand alone. He took multiple affirmative steps to replace his former spouse with his current spouse as beneficiary. Even ignoring the document the Board concluded could not be verified, Myron's actions are completely inconsistent with the intent to continue to provide benefits for his former spouse. In 2006, Myron submitted a request to OPM to change his beneficiary from Theresa to Roksoliana, providing his divorce decree from the former and marriage certificate to the latter. OPM requested clarification of his intent and Myron responded that he was electing to transfer survivor benefits to Roksoliana. OPM notified Myron that his election to transfer survivor benefits from Theresa to Roksoliana was effective immediately. We believe OPM's decisions to grant Roksoliana survivor annuity benefits and to deny Theresa survivor annuity benefits were correct. For these reasons, the Board's finding that Myron intended to provide Theresa with a survivor annuity is not supported by substantial evidence. That finding is reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Continued receipt of a reduced annuity, absent proper notice of the right to elect a former spouse annuity, sufficed to warrant waiver of the election deadline, <span class="Italic">Brush v. OPM</span>, 982 F.2d 1554, 1560-64 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously recognized an implied exception to election requirements which required action within one year of post-retirement remarriage in section 8339(j).[20] Where OPM fails to show that it has complied with the notice requirement under Pub.L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Davies,</span> OPM denied the retiree's application to make an election for survivor benefits for his spouse whom he acquired after retirement. The marriage was Davies' second. The wife to whom he was married at the time of his retirement died. The marriage at issue in his case was a post-retirement remarriage. OPM denied Davies' application to elect survivor benefits for his new wife because he had not notified OPM of the remarriage within one year as required in 8339(j). The Board found that OPM had not complied with the mandatory notice provision in Pub.L. No. 95-317 and ordered OPM to grant Davies a reduced annuity with survivor benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has previously approved of the Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Davies</span> to the problem presented when OPM fails to meet the burden placed upon it by the clear language of the statute.[25] Both <span class="Italic">Darsigny</span> and <span class="Italic">Harris</span> cite the Board's decision in Davies with approval. We agree with our two prior cases in their approval of Davies.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no meaningful distinction between the one-year limit for post-retirement remarriages faced by the Board in its prior decisions and the two-year limit at issue here. Both of these time limits on election periods are located in the same code section. More importantly, Pub.L. No. 95-317 mandates that notice be sent to all annuitants informing them of all election rights available in sections 8339(j) and (k)(2). The election at issue here is located in section 8339(j)(3); it is subject to the same notice requirement and must be treated the same in the event OPM fails to send the notice mandated by statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The onus is, as it must be in a case such as this, upon OPM to show that notice was sent. When a nonfrivolous allegation is made that OPM has not sent the mandatory notice as required by statute, the burden of going forward (or the burden of production) falls to OPM. The statute itself supports this statement, for it is the statute that places the initial burden on OPM to send the statutorily mandated notice of election rights to retirees. Further, OPM carries the ultimate burden of persuasion on the issue whether it sent the mandatory notice. OPM's ability to show that it sent the statutorily mandated notice is an essential element of its case. In addition, OPM is in a position to have knowledge of the particular facts necessary to support its position that it sent notice.[26] The Board's statement that Mrs. Brush did not show that notice was not sent places the burden of production on the wrong party. The Board's statement is contrary to common sense. The burden can not be upon the petitioner in the first instance to prove a negative. OPM presumably has access to the pertinent records, as well as to the people who deal with those records. Thus, the ultimate burden must be on OPM to show that the notice was actually sent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1986929791f2d1381894">791 F.2d 138</a>, 140 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the statutory mandate, OPM must show two things when attempting to prove that it has met its burden of providing retirees with the notice here in issue. First, OPM must attempt to prove that the notice was actually sent. Such evidence must be more than a bare allegation that notice was sent. Second, OPM must offer proof as to the contents of the annual notice. This must be so, because the statute clearly directs OPM to notify annuitants of all elections available under sections 8339(j) and (k)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the event that OPM is able to establish through credible evidence that it is more probable than not that the annual notice was sent, the burden of going forward falls upon the petitioner. The petitioner, if able to do so, must put forth such credible testimony or other evidence tending to support the contention that the annuitant in question did not receive the annual notice. The Board must then decide whether it will credit the applicant's testimony, and whether that testimony overcomes the presumption that the notice was received. As in other cases before the Board, evidence regarding the annuitant's conduct (in this case, Mr. Brush) is probative evidence regarding the question whether the annuitant would have made the election in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not speculate why Brush continued this payment to his detriment and to his former wife's benefit for yet another two years, but nothing in the record indicates that he lacked comprehension of his actions, or that he was unaware that he was continuing his election to "pay" for an annuity for Mrs. Brush, or that, if he had been notified, he would not have confirmed his choice by filing the additional piece of paper demanded. Every indication in the record here compels the conclusion that Brush affirmatively desired the annuity for Mrs. Brush. Furthermore, it is clear that he had no reason to believe that he needed to do anything further to effectuate it. One need not strain to perceive the election by Brush, in spite of the agency's failure to give notice. Arguably, he had indeed made the very election expected, in writing, at least constructively. And he "paid his dues."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice and election requirements are not only for the protection of the public fisc, but protection also of the individual. Here again we look to purpose. Notification protects the government from, among other things, claims that persons seeking entitlement might make in indeterminate circumstances. Congress anticipated that it would be clear, where notice is given, that a claimant acts or fails to act with knowledge with respect to the benefits provided by the statute. Also, Congress' obvious concern for individuals who by reason of age or any other considerations might not be aware of rights intended for them, is reflected in the notice requirement. If the notice reveals incomplete qualification, the employee can respond with knowledge. Here the employee had done everything necessary for the protection of both parties, except to restate in a specific form, a choice already known to both parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4229"></span>When Brush died, there still was remaining time within which he could have restated that choice. The happenstance of death is not an appropriate hook upon which to hang a finding of deficiency in meeting this technical or "paper" requirement, when all substantive economic requirements have been met. Failure of the agency to issue the notice did not harm the agency. Notice would have merely generated information it already had. But that failure did prevent Brush from being notified of the "paper" requirement, and conclusively so at the time of his death. There is a significant distinction with respect to the facts and the equities presented by Richmond and Brush; Richmond received erroneous information from a government employee who had no statutory authority or obligation to provide information, accurate or otherwise, while Brush never received information from a government agency that had an affirmative statutory duty to provide it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Brush maintains that OPM's failure to comply with its mandatory duty should not work to the government's benefit and to her detriment. We agree.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is affirmed with respect to its decision that Mrs. Brush did not qualify for an annuity as the surviving widow of Richard Brush.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, 1559 (Fed.

No. 98-615, 98 Stat. 3195 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), requires that OPM "must notify each annuitant annually of his or her rights of election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j) and (k)(2)." The court in <span class="Italic">Brush</span> referred to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note, which provides:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">Brush</span> rejected the government's position that this notice was required to be sent only in the event of post-retirement marriages, and held that the statutory notice requirement applied to all annuitants who were within the scope of sections 8339(j) and 8339(k)(2) of the Spouse Equity Act. Mr. Brush, who retired in 1984 and was divorced in 1987, was, under the Spouse Equity Act, entitled to elect a survivor annuity in favor of his former spouse. This court held that OPM was required by statute so to inform him. <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1559.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Vallee retired in 1982 and was divorced in 1984. He thereafter became, under the Spouse Equity Act, entitled to elect a survivor annuity in favor of his former spouse. Although OPM proposes to distinguish Mr. Vallee's facts from those of Mr. Brush, the Spouse Equity Act does not draw such distinction, and indeed it is undisputed that Mr. Vallee was entitled to invoke the benefits of the Spouse Equity Act. Thus we discern no controlling distinction between Mr. Vallee's situation and that decided by this court in <span class="Italic">Brush.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3) An employee or Member who has a former spouse may elect...to have the annuity computed under subsections (a)-(i), (n), and (q) of this section or a portion thereof reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under section 8341(h) of this title.&#8197;...An election under this paragraph shall be made at the time of retirement or, if later, within two years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is dissolved,...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also enacted was &#x00A7; 8341 note, which established a transition period whereby an employee who had already retired could elect the benefit of the Spouse Equity Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note [A survivor annuity will be provided if] the retired employee or Member elects, in writing, within eighteen months after the date of enactment of this Act, according to procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to have the annuity of such employee or Member reduced under section 8339(j)...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8341 note thus provided an additional window of opportunity for a retiree to elect the rights granted under &#x00A7; 8339(j). Since these rights arise pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j), the annual notice provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> applies, whether these rights are elected during the transition time period provided in &#x00A7; 8341 note, or the permanent time period stated in &#x00A7; 8339.&#8197;...The text is in contrast with the general public notice provision contained in &#x00A7; 4(c) of the Spouse Equity Act, which relates to retirees who marry after retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM admits that it did not advise Mr. Vallee that he could elect to provide a survivor annuity for Mrs. Vallee after the divorce. Mr. Vallee's annuity had already been reduced for Mrs. Vallee's survivorship benefit at the time of his retirement, before the divorce. Mr. Vallee declined to eliminate the reduction in his annuity following the divorce, when OPM notified him that he could restore his annuity to its full amount. He continued to receive a reduced annuity until his death in 1992, with former spouse Mrs. Vallee designated as his beneficiary. OPM did not notify him of the need to re-designate her as the beneficiary, despite 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that it was not required to notify a retiree who retired before May 7, 1985, the effective date of the Spouse Equity Act, of the election obligations and opportunities of that Act. OPM proposes to distinguish <span class="Italic">Brush</span> on the ground that Mr. Vallee was already divorced at the time the Act came into effect, whereas Mr. Brush was not. However, as this court explained in <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> the notice was intended to be given to those entitled to specific benefits under the Act. The notice form that was sent to Mr. Vallee in 1984 and 1986 was silent on the need to make an election under the Spouse Equity Act. Nor did the notice form state that no survivor annuity would be paid to his divorced spouse even if he continued to reduce his own annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is incorrect to read a statute contrary to its plain text, absent compelling evidence of contrary congressional intent. Congress specifically required that annuitants would be notified annually of the election rights of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j) and (k)(2). As the court held in <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> the OPM was under an affirmative statutory duty to provide the requisite information to annuitants. 982 F.2d at 1559. That duty was not met as to Mr. Vallee. As in <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> the failure of OPM to give the mandated notice excused the retiree's noncompliance with the election requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as in <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> in order to authorize payment of the survivor annuity in these circumstances (where the retiree is now dead), there must be evidence sufficient to show that the retiree indeed intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse. 982 F.2d at 1560. In Mr. Vallee's case the evidence is similar to that deemed sufficient in <span class="Italic">Brush.</span> Mr. Vallee had elected a survivor annuity for Mrs. Vallee when he retired. When he was notified in 1984 and again in 1986 of his right to have his annuity restored to its full value after the divorce, he declined to do so. These actions are evidence of the intent to provide a survivor annuity for Mrs. Vallee, and are inconsistent with the contrary position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that Mr. Vallee intended to provide a survivor annuity for his former wife, and that the failure of statutory notice excused the absence of re-election. It is ordered that Mrs. Vallee shall be paid the survivor annuity that was elected on her behalf by Mr. Vallee at his retirement, as if the re-election had been duly made.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brush</span> was distinguished by <span class="Italic">Belanger v. OPM</span>, 1 F.3d 1223, 1229-30 (Fed. Cir. 1993), when OPM's notices, although not entirely clear, differed from those required in <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> and were sufficient to notify the annuitant of what he had to do to properly create a former spouse survivor annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Robert Belanger's case differs significantly from the facts in <span class="Italic">Brush</span>. First, <span class="Italic">Brush</span> holds in accordance with the statute that OPM is obligated to provide annual notice to "annuitants." 982 F.2d at 1559. Robert Belanger did not become an "annuitant" until December 13, 1989, when his application for retirement was granted. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(9) (1988) ("annuitant" means a former employee....) <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. Sec. 831.112(b)(2) (1989) (annuitant is a "person who has been separated from service...."). From that point onward, OPM was obligated to give him annual notice of his "rights of election." <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1559. Since Robert Belanger died within a year of his retirement, OPM could not have violated this notice provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's argument also fails because the right to change an election within thirty days of receiving the initial payment is not a "right of election" within the notification requirement of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8339. The notification requirement at issue here is limited to those "rights of election" found in 5 U.S.C. Secs. 8339(j) and (k)(2)--namely, the right to elect for a former <span id="Page_4230"></span>spouse a survivor annuity in the event of post-retirement divorce, and to elect for a new spouse a survivor annuity in the event of a post-retirement marriage or remarriage. Such "rights of election" are changes which may arise after a government employee retires--i.e., after he or she becomes an "annuitant." Periodic reminders of the available options is of obvious importance when those elections must be made within a certain time period, and the occasion for those elections may arise years after retirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> S. Rep. No. 904, 95th Cong. 2nd Sess. (1978), 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1024, 1035 (letter of Jule Sugarman, Chairman of the Civil Service Comm'n, supporting passage of the notification provision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to make changes amongst the options initially elected at retirement is quite different. Congress provided by statute that a former spouse annuity "shall be made at the time of retirement...." 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8339(j)(3). Pursuant to OPM's statutory authority to "prescribe such regulations as are necessary and proper to carry out this subchapter," 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8347(a) (1988), OPM provided a limited grace period in which to correct a mistake: "An employee...may name a new survivor or change his election of type of annuity if, not later than 30 days after the date of the first regular payment, the...employee...files with OPM a new written election." 5 C.F.R. Sec. 831.609.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to change an initial election is thus limited by statute and regulation. Given the size of the retirement program which OPM administers, common sense dictates that an employee's elections at retirement become irrevocable, absent some future change in circumstances as envisioned by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8339 and its notification provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that Robert Belanger in fact had been given notice of the permanency of his elections. The instructions accompanying the retirement application form, which Maureen with his power of attorney filled out and signed in 1989, state: "[C]onsider your election carefully. No change will be permitted after your annuity is granted except as explained in the instructions." Absent a specific Congressional directive, OPM need do no more. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 918 F.2d 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Nordstrom v. United States,</span> 342 F.2d 55, 59, 169 Ct. Cl. 632 (1965)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to notice of the obligation to elect a desired spousal survivor annuity following divorce, under <span class="Italic">Beckstead v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210107136">842 Fed. Appx. 578</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also worth noting that when Mr. Beckstead initially elected a survivor annuity for Mrs. Beckstead, he did so by filling out Standard Form ("SF") 2801 ("Application for Immediate Retirement"). SF 2801 includes a section with the heading "Section F--Annuity Election," in which it explicitly states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An election for your spouse ends if your marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Immediately below that language, the form again states the effects of <span id="Page_4231"></span>divorce, this time in specific reference to the survivor annuity that Mr. Beckstead actually elected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If your marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment, this election terminates and you must notify the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that the combination of the language in SF 2801 and OPM's Annual Notice constitutes legally sufficient notice of survivor annuity election rights under the law. <span class="Italic">Downing</span>, 619 F.3d at 1378. Therefore, because it is not disputed that OPM sent Mr. Beckstead the Annual Notice, we conclude that OPM met the statutory notice requirements in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Turning to Board decisions, if OPM does not provide proper notice concerning the need to affirmatively notify OPM of the election of a survivor annuity following divorce (and remarriage), the Board may construe an election based on circumstances indicative of the annuitant's intent before his death, <span class="Italic">Painter v. OPM</span>, 106 MSPR 385, 388-89 &#x00B6; 5-10, 2007 MSPB 189 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Divorce terminates a prior election of spousal survivor benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 450 F.3d 1332, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Thus, when Mr. Painter divorced the appellant on December 11, 1998, his election of a survivor annuity was terminated. A former spouse may receive survivor benefits if the CSRS annuitant makes an affirmative election to grant such benefits, however. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3); <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1334. OPM has a statutory obligation to notify each annuitant annually of his election rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note; <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1334; <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, 1559-60 (Fed. Cir. 1992). On appeal, OPM has the burden of proving both that it sent the annual notice and that the notice was adequate to inform the annuitant of the specific election requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j). <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1335; <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1561. A notice regarding election of former spouse survivor benefits is insufficient if it does not "stat[e] that a pre-divorce election automatically terminates upon divorce and that an annuitant must make a new election to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse." <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1335 <span class="Italic">(</span>quoting<span class="Italic"> Simpson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 347 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, OPM has provided no evidence that it sent the statutorily mandated annual notice to Mr. Painter and that Mr. Painter was sufficiently put on notice that he had to make a new election to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1561 (OPM must attempt to prove that the notice was actually sent; such evidence must be more than a bare allegation that a notice was sent; and OPM must offer proof as to the contents of the annual notice). We therefore find that a remand is necessary to determine whether OPM did send the statutorily mandated annual notice and whether the notice was adequate to inform Mr. Painter of the election requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse may receive survivor annuity benefits even without an affirmative election by the annuitant if (1) the annuitant did not receive the required notice, and (2) "there [is] evidence sufficient to show that the retiree indeed intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse." <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1334-35 <span class="Italic">(</span>quoting <span class="Italic">Wood v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 241 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). Thus, if OPM failed to notify Mr. Painter of his right to elect a survivor annuity for the appellant after their December 11, 1998 divorce, and the evidence shows that he intended to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant, the appellant is entitled to former spouse survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM alleged that: On January 4, 1999, Mr. Painter requested cancellation of the survivor annuity that he had elected for the appellant; the reduction in Mr. Painter's retirement annuity therefore was eliminated; and effective January 1, 1999, Mr. Painter's annuity was reissued at the unreduced rate. OPM has not provided a copy of Mr. Painter's January 4, 1999 request that the pre-divorce survivor annuity be canceled and has not provided documentation to support its allegations that the survivor annuity was eliminated from Mr. Painter's retirement annuity and that his retirement annuity was restored to an unreduced annuity. <span class="Italic">See Frye v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 11 (2006) (statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence). Because these alleged actions by Mr. Painter relate to whether or not he intended for the appellant to receive a former spouse survivor annuity, we find that a remand is necessary also to determine whether Mr. Painter intended to provide the appellant a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez,</span> 450 F.3d at 1335 (inadequate notice only entitles a former spouse to benefits if there is sufficient evidence that the annuitant intended for the former spouse to receive benefits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that Mr. Painter signed an SF-2808 Designation of Beneficiary on January 26, 1999, naming his three children as beneficiaries to receive any lump-sum benefit payable after his death and canceling his previous designation, executed on October 1, 1996, naming the appellant as the beneficiary. The SF-2808 clearly states, however, that "this designation of beneficiary will not affect the rights of any survivors who may qualify for annuity benefits after [the annuitant's] death. The administrative judge therefore erred in relying on this form in finding that such an action is inconsistent with Mr. Painter's intent to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant. ID at 6; <span class="Italic">see Kirk v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 10 (2003) (the SF-2808 does not manifest the appellant's unmistakable intent to elect a survivor annuity benefit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that, because the interests of Mr. Painter's three children may be directly affected by the outcome of this appeal on remand in view of the SF-2808 mentioned above, they should be afforded an opportunity to intervene in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(a); <span class="Italic">Boulware v.

<p class="Body-Text">The AJ must properly evaluate evidence, including hearsay, concerning receipt of OPM notices on survivor annuity elections, <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 335, 337-338 (1997) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. OPM</span>, 180 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant bears the burden of proving her entitlement to the retirement benefits that she seeks. <span class="Italic">Isabelle v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 176, 180 (1996). It is undisputed that Mr. Schoemakers did not make an election to provide a survivor annuity for Mrs. Schoemakers before the end of the 2-year time limit on October 2, 1992, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A). However, the statutory deadline may be waived if the annuitant did not receive from OPM the annual notice required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.681 of his right to make an election. <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 982 F.2d 1554, 1559-60 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered OPM's evidence that it sent Mr. Schoemakers annual notice of his right to make an election in the years relevant to this appeal. OPM submitted an April 20, 1994 affidavit by Mary Beth Smith-Toomey, Manager of the printing and distribution of forms and notices operation for OPM's Retirement and Insurance Group, in which she stated that general notices regarding survivor elections <span id="Page_4232"></span>were sent to all annuitants in, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, December 1990 and December 1991, according to procedures detailed in the affidavit. Smith-Toomey's affidavit was supported by photocopies of OPM's general notices sent to all annuitants. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have held that an affidavit by an OPM official familiar with the history of OPM's notices stating that OPM general annual notices of election rights, including the election at issue in the particular appeal, were sent to all annuitants at the relevant times constitutes probative evidence that, if unrebutted, proves that OPM provided the required notices. <span class="Italic">See Darsigny v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 787 F.2d 1555, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Alton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 292, 294-95 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, although noting that the appellant argued that the 2-year deadline should be excused because he never received notice of his right to make an election of a survivor annuity for Mrs. Schoemakers, found that the appellant's failure to present evidence of that in the form of an affidavit or declaration was fatal to his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that Mr. Schoemakers produced no evidence that he did not receive the notice of a right to make an election. We agree with the appellant that that finding was overly broad. In <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 211, 228 (1995), we held that unsworn statements by an appellant in an initial appeal file constitute hearsay evidence entitled to the weight that they deserve under <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 83-87 (1981) (assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily depends on the circumstances of each case). Here, Mr. Schoemakers stated in his September 12, 1995 request for reconsideration by OPM that, after his marriage, he and his wife went to an attorney to prepare wills and an irrevocable trust, that he believed no more was necessary for his wife to receive all of his benefits, and that his attorney did not inform him of the necessity of notifying OPM of his marriage. He further stated that he learned of his obligation to notify OPM of his marriage from an acquaintance and that he notified OPM as soon as he could. It appears that the administrative judge did not consider Mr. Schoemakers' statement because it was unsworn. We therefore remand this appeal so that the administrative judge can consider this evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, the Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. OPM</span>, 180 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Darsigny v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 787 F.2d 1555, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1986) dealt with a similar affidavit by "a man familiar with the history of notices included with civil service checks." It stated that "Darsigny received his annuity checks via Electronic Funds Transfer directly to his bank, that the computer generated a tape, listing all annuitants...which was sent to the Treasury Department who then mailed the notices according to the tape" and that "no one who received the August 1981 and April 1982 payments could have been missed. Via this procedure, notices must have been sent to Maurice Darsigny since payments for those months were made." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We held that this affidavit was sufficient to prove the sending of the notices. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Although the affidavit in Darsigny did not show the identical practices the affidavit in this case disclosed and, unlike the latter, twice referred by name to the particular annuitant involved, these distinctions do not warrant rejecting the affidavit in this case as inadequate proof that OPM mailed the notices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brush</span> we required that OPM's evidence "must be more than a bare allegation that notice was sent," and must show "the contents of the annual notices." 982 F.2d at 1561. As we have shown, the proof in this case satisfied both requirements. <span class="Italic">See id</span> at 1561 n.27 (citing <span class="Italic">Darsigny</span> with approval).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Schoemakers challenges the sufficiency of the affidavit because it described OPM's practices generally, but did not "specifically relate to any notices that were allegedly sent to Mr. Schoemakers during that period." There is no requirement, however, that OPM's proof relate to any specific notices sent to the particular annuitant, as <span class="Italic">Darsigny</span> makes clear. The question simply is whether OPM has "establish[ed] through credible evidence that it is more probable than not that the annual notice was sent." <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1561. Since there is no claim that Mr. Schoemakers did not receive his annuity payments, his name must have been on OPM's list of annuitants. The affidavit stated that "[g]eneral notices regarding survivor elections were sent to all annuitants" and that, as a result of the procedures OPM followed, "a notice was sent to each and every annuitant on [OPM's] rolls at the time of each mailing." It is a reasonable inference from these statements that the notices were sent to Mr. Schoemakers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the affidavit here satisfied OPM's burden. This holding also disposes of Mrs. Schoemakers' other argument that the affidavit was inadequate because it did not include evidence from the contractor who mailed the notices that it had done so, which she claims is a necessary "foundation" to the use of the affidavit. The technical rules of evidence do not apply to Board proceedings, and we reject this contention.</p>

OPM</span>, CH-0831-16-0094-I-1 (NP 9/8/2016) ("There is no requirement that OPM provide such specific evidence. <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 180 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The question is whether OPM has provided credible evidence showing that it is more likely than not that the annual notice was sent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, OPM provided an affidavit from a responsible OPM official averring that general notices regarding survivor elections were sent to all annuitants annually and explaining the procedures by which notices were mailed to each annuitant on the master annuity roll.

The notices explain that a new survivor annuity election must be made within 2 years after the date a former spouse loses entitlement to a survivor annuity.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although deductions for a survivor annuity continued (and were refunded) after the death of appellant's wife, the ability to designate a survivor annuity following remarriage was not effective when it was untimely following proper notice from OPM in <span class="Italic">Stillwell v. OPM</span>, AT-0843-15-0122-I-1 (NP 9/22/2015), also declining to permit waiver of the appellant's election deadline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon remarriage, an annuitant who was married at the time of retirement and subsequently remarries may elect within 2 years following his remarriage to receive a reduced retirement annuity so as to provide for a survivor annuity for his current spouse. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(C)(i); <span class="Italic">see Duzon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 7 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his deceased wife remained entitled to the survivor annuity, regardless of the fact that his election terminated upon her death, until on or around October 29, 2014, when OPM notified him of his refund. Therefore, he contends, his February 2014 election request was timely filed within 2 years of the end of his deceased wife's entitlement. He bases this argument on the fact that in OPM's June 17, 2014 initial decision denying his request to elect a survivor annuity for his current wife, OPM stated that it "ha[d] not made the adjustment to remove [his deceased wife] from his annuity" and instructed him to advise OPM if he "would like to make that adjustment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument has no merit. The law is clear that the appellant's election of a survivor annuity terminated upon the death of his former wife and that, to provide a survivor annuity for his current wife, he was required to make the election within 2 years of his remarriage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A)(i); <span class="Italic">see Williams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 29, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). OPM's apparently erroneous action of continuing the deductions from the appellant's annuity to fund a survivor annuity following the death of the appellant's previous wife, as documented in the June 17, 2014 letter, did not alter this requirement. <span class="Italic">See Calkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 9 (2011) (addressing the fact that the payment of a retirement benefit may not be made in direct contravention of CSRS). Indeed, OPM later recognized and corrected its error, refunding the improperly deducted amount to the appellant. We therefore find that the appellant did not timely elect a survivor annuity for his current spouse because he failed to do so within 2 years of their marriage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">OPM properly notified the appellant of the specific requirements for electing a survivor annuity.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Public Law No. 95-317 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note), OPM is required by statute to notify annuitants annually of their survivor annuity election rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j) and (k)(2). <span class="Italic">Cartsounis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 5 (2002). This statutory obligation is not satisfied simply by providing accurate annual notices. <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 452 F.3d 1361, 1365-67 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Rather, OPM is statutorily obligated to provide straight forward, full and accurate information regarding election rights in all of its communications to the employee or former employee, so that statutorily-required notice is not diluted or contradicted. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Wood v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 241 F.3d 1364, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If OPM fails to provide such notice, it cannot deny an annuity even if formal election has not been made during the applicable time period, so long as there is some evidence that the employee wished to elect a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Wood</span>, 241 F.3d at 1366. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, the annuitant sent a letter to OPM, prior to his divorce, requesting information regarding how to continue his spouse's survivor annuity once the divorce was finalized. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1365. OPM informed him that he could voluntarily elect to provide survivor coverage for an ex-spouse and that he should notify OPM if his marriage were ever terminated, but did not provide any further information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1365-66. Wood did not notify OPM of his divorce but, after he divorced and within the 2-year election period, he received a notice from OPM informing him of the requirement to elect a survivor annuity within 2 years of his divorce and that he would receive a reduced annuity if he so elected. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1366. Wood never made an election after his divorce, but continued to receive a reduced annuity until his death. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that, notwithstanding Wood's failure to make an election following his <span id="Page_4233"></span>divorce, his ex-wife was entitled to a survivor annuity because OPM did not provide Wood with adequate notice of his election rights and Wood had manifested an intention to provide her with one. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1367-68. In particular, the court noted that OPM's failure to mention, in response to Wood's inquiry letter, that he was required to make an election after his divorce became final could have caused him to believe that his letter was sufficient to constitute an election, particularly given that he continued to receive a reduced annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1367. Although the annual notice Wood received following his divorce, standing alone, was adequate, it was insufficient to put him on notice of the election requirements because it was "hardly a model of clarity, and did little to correct the earlier confusion" created by OPM's incomplete response to his inquiry letter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserted below, and reiterates on review, that he contacted OPM in or around April 2011 to inquire about electing a survivor annuity for his then-fianc&#x00E9;e upon their marriage and an OPM representative informed him that she would not become eligible to be his survivor annuity beneficiary until 9 months after their marriage, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(C)(ii), but made no mention of the requirement to file an election within 2 years of their marriage. The administrative judge failed to address this argument below and we thus modify the initial decision in this regard. For the reasons set forth below, we discern no harm because to the extent that the appellant alleges that he did not receive adequate notice because the OPM representative misled him into believing that the sole restriction governing his election of a survivor annuity for his new wife was the 9-month waiting period, we disagree. <span class="Italic">See Panter</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. at 282.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we note that the appellant's assertions concerning his April 2011 communication with OPM are made through his attorney. He has not provided any sworn statement or affidavit to support this claim. Thus, there is no evidence that this communication occurred as alleged.[3] <span class="Italic">See Hendricks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 163, 168 (1995) (finding that the statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence). Even if it did, we find that OPM's annual notices were sufficient to correct any confusion the appellant may have had.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The record contains what the appellant's attorney asserts are contemporaneous notes the appellant took during the April 2011 conversation; and a calendar entry the appellant made following his April 2011 communication with OPM, reflecting that he recorded the date his new wife would become eligible for a survivor annuity. However, the appellant did not provide a sworn statement or affidavit explaining what these documents are and, in any event, the handwritten notes are illegible. The appellant also submitted telephone records indicating that he called OPM in April 2011, but this does nothing to prove the content of that telephone conversation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the content of OPM's annual notices to an annuitant adequately informed him of his election rights, we look to the notice sent immediately after the event that would result in his election or reelection decision. <span class="Italic">Duzon</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 11. There is no dispute that the appellant received annual notices from OPM in or around December 2011 and December 2012, after he remarried and within the 2-year election period. Yet, he disputes that these notices were adequate to inform him of the requirements for electing a survivor annuity for his current spouse. We disagree. OPM's notices informed him that: "Survivor elections terminate upon the death of the person elected...a survivor annuity election made at retirement...terminate[s] upon death...and the annuitant must make a new election (reelection) within 2 years after the terminating event to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement. Continuing a survivor reduction, <span class="Italic">by itself</span>, is not effective to reelect a survivor annuity for a spouse married after retirement." The notices further stated that a "survivor election for a spouse you marry after retirement" "must" be submitted "in writing, before the expiration of the 2-year time limit."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that these notices are abundantly clear and the appellant's arguments to the contrary, including his claim that he had "a reasonable and good faith belief that he had properly elected to provide survivor annuity benefits for his current spouse," are unpersuasive. Further, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, we cannot find that these notices lacked clarity and thus were insufficient to correct any confusion that may have resulted from the appellant's alleged April 2011 communication with OPM. If OPM somehow misled him into believing that there was no time limit for making an election, other than having to wait for 9 months after his marriage, this was corrected when he was twice notified that an election must be made within 2 years of the date of his marriage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the administrative judge erred in citing to <span class="Italic">Downing v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 619 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2010), in support of his finding that the appellant received adequate notice. Specifically, he notes that <span class="Italic">Downing</span> concerned language relating to making an election for a former spouse, whereas the issue in the instant case is the language relating to making an election for a current spouse upon post-retirement remarriage. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We discern no error. The administrative judge discussed in detail the factors he considered in finding the notices at issue in this appeal adequate. We agree with his analysis and we also find additional support for his analysis in the notices, as discussed above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We deny the appellant's request for a waiver of the election deadline.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that, even if his election request were untimely filed, the "equitable principles of justice and good conscience" demand that the Board waive the filing deadline because: (1) the delay was minimal; (2) he had a lengthy Federal career; (3) he had a "reasonable and good faith belief that he had properly elected to provide survivor annuity benefits for his current spouse"; and (4) denying his request would have a "devastating and permanent impact."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that equitable considerations do not provide a basis for awarding benefits not otherwise authorized by law. <span class="Italic">Hunt v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 449, &#x00B6; 9 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990)). We recognize that, in addition to OPM's failure to provide required statutory notice, a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation may be waived if: (1) the statute or regulation specifically provides for a waiver under the circumstances; or (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct precludes enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, at least where such estoppel would not result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of a statute. <span class="Italic">See Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 8 (2007). However, neither of these exceptions is applicable here. As a result, we deny the appellant's request. Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision except as modified herein.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harris v. OPM</span>, DE-0843-15-0066-I-1 (NP 2/10/2016), considered a combination of factors, including alleged estoppel based on misrepresentation, but declined to waive a requirement of a written election for a survivor annuity under FERS for an employee within 18 months of retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Harris died on May 6, 2013, approximately 13 months after her retirement. On May 28, 2013, the appellant wrote to OPM, stating that OPM had provided him with misinformation regarding the ability to change Mrs. Harris's annuity election pursuant to the power of attorney, and requesting that "Survivor Benefits for [Mrs. Harris] [be] allowed as she wished on her death bed." The appellant subsequently filed an application for survivor annuity benefits, which OPM denied on the ground that its records reflected that Mrs. Harris did not elect to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual seeking retirement benefits bears the burden of proving entitlement to those benefits by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8416(d)(1), an annuitant, such as Mrs. Harris, who was married at the time of retirement and jointly waived any right that her spouse had to a survivor annuity, has an 18-month window after her retirement to elect to reduce her monthly annuity payment to provide a survivor annuity for her spouse. However, pursuant to an OPM regulation, such an election must be made before the retiree dies. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.610(b)(1), (6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, although Mrs. Harris could have elected to provide the appellant with a survivor annuity within an 18-month window after her retirement, she had to file such an election with OPM prior to her death, which occurred approximately 13 months after her retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8416(d)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.610(b)(1), (6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither Mrs. Harris, nor the appellant acting on her behalf pursuant to the power of attorney, filed an election of a survivor annuity with OPM prior to her death. Therefore, the pertinent inquiry is whether the appellant established a basis for waiver of this deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) the statute or regulation may provide for a waiver under specified circumstances; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel; and (3) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline, where such notice is required by statute or regulation, may warrant a waiver of the deadline. <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 7 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the appellant has not challenged the administrative judge's finding that the first potential basis for waiver does not apply, and we discern no reason to disturb this finding on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant argues on review that basis (2), the doctrine of equitable estoppel, warrants waiver of the filing deadline. In OPM's response to the show cause order, it argues that equitable estoppel is unavailable as a potential basis for waiver under <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414 (1990). We agree with the <span id="Page_4234"></span>administrative judge that equitable estoppel is available as a potential basis for waiver but that the requirements for invoking the doctrine are not met here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Richmond</span> holds that estoppel against the Government cannot result in the payment of money not otherwise provided for by law. 496 U.S. at 415-16, 424, 434. However, the Board previously has held that equitable estoppel would not result in the unlawful expenditure of appropriated funds in violation of Richmond where appellants untimely sought to provide for or increase survivor annuities. <span class="Italic">See Nunes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 18 (2009) (finding that equitable estoppel would not result in the unlawful expenditure of funds where an appellant sought to reduce his Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) annuity to provide his spouse with a survivor annuity, although his election of a survivor annuity was untimely); <span class="Italic">Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2007) (determining that equitable estoppel would not result in the unlawful expenditure of funds where an appellant untimely sought to change her CSRS annuity election to provide her domestic partner with a survivor annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that the present case is distinguishable from prior cases in which the Board has held that equitable estoppel is available as a potential basis for waiver because Mrs. Harris did not "pay for" a survivor annuity by receiving a reduced annuity during her lifetime. We find this argument unpersuasive. We perceive no pertinent distinction between the present case and a situation where a retiree dies immediately after filing an election with OPM. In either scenario, the retiree did not "pay for" the survivor annuity through receipt of a reduced annuity during his or her lifetime. However, OPM permits a survivor to collect an annuity if the retiree died before his or her payments were reduced, provided that the retiree paid the required deposit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8416(d)(2)(B) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.610(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, if the filing deadline were waived, OPM could simply reduce the appellant's survivor annuity to recover the deposit that Mrs. Harris was required by law to make to entitle the appellant to such an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7-10 (2004) (finding that OPM was in compliance with an order to provide a CSRS survivor annuity when it reduced the annuity to recover the deposit that the appellant's decedent was required to make). For these reasons, we discern no reason to depart from the Board's prior decisions in <span class="Italic">Nunes</span> and <span class="Italic">Blaha</span>, and find that <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> is not a barrier to the availability of equitable estoppel as a possible basis for waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, although equitable estoppel is available as a potential basis for waiver, we agree with the administrative judge that equitable estoppel does not form a basis for waiving the regulatory filing deadline under the facts of this case. The appellant argues on review that the filing deadline should be waived based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel because OPM negligently provided him with misinformation when the OPM representative told him that he could not change Mrs. Harris's survivor annuity election pursuant to a power of attorney. In OPM's response to the show cause order, OPM submitted evidence, in the form of printouts from OPM's website and OPM's Representative Payee Application, indicating that OPM will not make a payee change based upon a power of attorney and that OPM does not recognize power of attorney filings, with the sole exception of changes to Federal Employees Health Benefits Program coverage.[3] Therefore, the OPM representative accurately informed the appellant that OPM would not allow him to change Mrs. Harris's survivor annuity election pursuant to a power of attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant argues that these provisions are not applicable to him because he did not apply to be a representative payee. However, although several of the documents submitted by OPM refer to representative payees, the documents reflect that OPM generally does not recognize power of attorney filings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, although the OPM representative accurately conveyed OPM's policy, the policy was not arrived at after a formal adjudication or notice-and-comment rulemaking, and therefore, is not entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984). <span class="Italic">See Christensen v. Harris County</span>, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (finding that interpretations of statutes contained in "opinion letters--like interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law--do not warrant <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>-style deference"). Nevertheless, the policy potentially would be entitled to a lesser degree of deference depending on "the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade." <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Company</span>, 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944); <span class="Italic">see Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 380, 384-85 (1994) (declining to afford deference to an alleged OPM policy where OPM failed to provide "meaningful guidance or substantial evidence of a consistent policy" on this issue) (citing <span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 974 F.2d 164, 168 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (declining to defer to an OPM policy that was not "properly or publicly announced")).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide the issue of whether to defer to OPM's policy, however, because, even assuming that the policy is invalid, we agree with the administrative judge that we cannot waive the filing deadline based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel. Our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), has held that, to establish a claim of equitable estoppel against a Government agency, an appellant must demonstrate affirmative misconduct on the part of Government officials. <span class="Italic">Zacharin v. United States</span>, 213 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The Board also has repeatedly held that an agency's negligent provision of misinformation does not constitute affirmative misconduct. <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Scriffiny v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2008), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Nunes</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 15. The appellant failed either to allege or establish that the OPM representative who informed him of OPM's policy intentionally provided him with inaccurate information, or otherwise engaged in affirmative misconduct. Therefore, we conclude that the filing deadline in this case cannot be waived based upon the doctrine of equitable estoppel. <span class="Italic">See Perez Peraza</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 10 (determining that an administrative judge erred in applying equitable estoppel where the evidence did not demonstrate that the relevant Government officials knew that they were providing the appellant with inaccurate information). We have considered the appellant's arguments on review that the application of these standards is unfair, but the equities of the situation do not alter our obligation to apply the relevant legal standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant also asserts that the filing deadline should be waived because the OPM representative allegedly failed to advise him that he could change Mrs. Harris's annuity election if he obtained a guardianship. We construe the appellant's assertion as an argument that basis (3), an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline where such notice is required by statute or regulation, warrants waiver of the filing deadline. However, in response to the show cause order, OPM submitted evidence, in the form of OPM's representative payee approval notice and OPM's internal guidance, indicating that OPM does not allow court-appointed guardians or other representative payees to make decisions regarding survivor annuities on behalf of annuitants. Therefore, the appellant's assertion that OPM would have permitted him to change Mrs. Harris's survivor annuity election if he had obtained a guardianship is incorrect. In any event, no statute or regulation requires OPM to provide notice regarding the ability to change a survivor annuity election by means of a guardianship, and accordingly, OPM's failure to provide such notice would not form a basis for waiving the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Speker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385-86 (1990) (finding that OPM's failure to notify an appellant of her right to elect an alternative annuity did not form a basis for waiving a filing deadline where the applicable statute and regulations in effect at the time did not require OPM to provide such notice), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 602, 606 n.4 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An election will not be construed based on a choice of a survivor annuity before divorce if a divorce decree or order does not then provide for a former spouse annuity and if the evidence is conditional or unclear as to the contention that an OPM notice was not received by the annuitant, <span class="Italic">Briggs v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">At retirement, a federal employee can elect to receive a reduced annuity to provide survivor annuity benefits. Divorce, however, terminates a prior election of spousal survivor annuity benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Ms. Briggs concedes that her former husband never made a new election and that the divorce decree does not grant her survivor annuity benefits.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When OPM is able to establish "through credible evidence that it is more probable than not that the annual notice was sent," the burden shifts to the petitioner to establish that the annuitant never received notice. <span class="Italic">Brush</span>, 982 F.2d at 1561; <span class="Italic">see also Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1380. The petitioner "must put forth such credible testimony or other evidence tending to support the contention that the annuitant in question did not receive the annual notice." <span class="Italic">Brush</span>, 982 F.2d at 1561. If the petitioner comes forward with such evidence, the Board must determine "whether it will credit the [petitioner's evidence], and whether that testimony overcomes the presumption that the notice was received." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Briggs argues that OPM did not prove that Mr. Briggs received annual notice.[2] Because the Government concedes that substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Mr. Briggs intended to provide Ms. Briggs with survivor annuity benefits, the only issue on appeal is whether substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that OPM provided Mr. Briggs with annual notice of his election rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;It is unclear whether Ms. Briggs also argues that, in the alternative, if her husband did in fact receive the December 2009 notice that, because Mr. Briggs' medical condition prevented him from being able to understand the notice, the two-year statutory period for requesting a survivor annuity should be waived. To the extent Ms. Briggs raises this argument, we must reject it. <span class="Italic">See Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1382 (holding that the two-year statutory period for requesting a survivor annuity for a new spouse who was married after the annuitant's retirement could not be waived because of the annuitant's mental condition).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, OPM submitted an affidavit stating, "that it sent general notices providing information regarding survivor elections to all annuitants on various dates, and...that such notice was sent in December 2009--while Mr. Briggs was still alive and after the divorce."<span class="Italic">--</span>The affidavit explains, moreover, how the list of addresses to which OPM sent notices was created and how the computer system created mailings from the "Mastery Annuity Roll."<span class="Italic"></span> Ms. Briggs testified that the address that OPM had on file for Mr. Briggs was his residence at the time in question. Finally, the Government attached a copy of the form notice sent to annuitants. This notice informed the annuitant that a divorce terminated a prior survivor election and that a new election needed to be made to within two years from the date of the divorce to enable a former spouse to receive survivor benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 24. We have previously held that the language in this form provides adequate notice that an annuitant must reelect within two years of divorce to provide survivor annuity benefits. <span class="Italic">See Downing</span>, 619 F.3d at 1378 &#x0026; n.2. This evidence is sufficient to establish that OPM sent adequate annual notice to Mr. Briggs. <span class="Italic">See Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1380-81. The burden, thus, shifted to Ms. Briggs to present evidence that Mr. Briggs never received the December 2009 notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To rebut the presumption that Mr. Briggs received the December 2009 notice, Ms. Briggs offers a letter from her son, Kevin Briggs, who took care of Mr. Briggs during the relevant time period. This letter is insufficient for three reasons. First, the letter is not a sworn affidavit. Second, it was never presented to the Board. The letter is not, therefore, record evidence. Lastly, even if we could consider the contents of the letter, it is still insufficient to establish that Mr. Briggs did not receive the December 2009 notice. In the two-sentence letter, Kevin Briggs states that "[Mr. Briggs] could not do much for himself I did his meals, his appointments, his prescriptions, his mail, his bills and anything else he needed me to do." He then states that "I want to confirm that [Mr. Briggs] did not receive a form from OPM regarding changes in his retirement annuity status, if he had he would have certainly made the change for my Mother to remain as his surviving former spouse."<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This letter fails to establish that Mr. Briggs did not receive the December 2009 notice. First, as evidenced by the final sentence of the letter, Kevin Briggs does not state unequivocally that his father did not receive the notice. Second, to the extent that Kevin Briggs is at-tempting to make such an unequivocal statement, his certainty is based upon his belief that, if Mr. Briggs had received the December 2009 notice, he would have sent the required election to OPM. Such a conditional statement is insufficient to establish that Mr. Briggs did not receive the December 2009 notice. <span class="Italic">See Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1381 (rejecting a conditional affidavit that merely established that petitioner's wife did not receive the required annual notice and not that her husband, the annuitant, did not receive it).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this case presents us with a straightforward legal question, its disposition is a difficult one. We are sympathetic to Ms. Briggs' plight. The record makes clear that Mr. Briggs intended to provide his ex-wife with survivor annuity benefits and that, during their marriage, he reduced his own annuity benefits so as to make that happen. Unfortunately, Mr. Briggs failed to follow the procedures necessary to bring this outcome to fruition. Other than noting our sympathy for Ms. Briggs, there is nothing we can do to alter the outcome dictated by the system Congress put in place. Here, to establish her entitlement to benefits, Ms. Briggs was required to establish that, among other things, Mr. Briggs did not receive the required annual notice. Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that OPM proved that Mr. Briggs received adequate annual notice in December 2009, however. Accordingly, Ms. Briggs is not entitled to receive survivor annuity benefits. We must affirm.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Clearly, it is not unreasonable for OPM to assume that appellant received the notice, since it was supposedly sent to everyone. Yet there is no reliable proof that the notice was sent and received by appellant. Notwithstanding this, we find that at the time appellant was married the controlling statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 (k) (2), specifically and clearly set forth the one-year time limit for electing a reduced annuity with survivor benefits. There was, however, no provision either statutory or regulatory which required OPM to notify the annuitants of their right to make this election. Thus, OPM had no duty to notify appellant of his right of election, nor of the time limits during which such election must be made. <span class="Italic">Cf. Davies v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 5 MSPB 251 (1981) (the Board found for the appellant when OPM failed to offer preponderant evidence on the issue of annual notice to each annuitant of their right of election, required by Public Law No. 95-317 (1978)). Appellant, having failed to comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 (k)(2), has forfeited his right to elect a reduced annuity with survivorship benefits. We find that appellant's letters to OPM within the one year deadline period clearly related to retirement, health and life insurance and not to a survivorship annuity for his wife. Appellant has offered no evidence to show that any provision of the statute or OPM regulations permits an exception to the one-year statute of limitations contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 (k)(2). Following the mandate of Congress, OPM had no discretionary authority to waive the statutory one-year deadline. <span class="Italic">See Shelley v.
