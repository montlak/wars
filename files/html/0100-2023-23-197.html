<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-192"><span class="space">7.</span> Time for Initiating Enforcement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1201.182(a) (2022), an enforcement petition should be brought "promptly," but within 30 days if the agency provides notice that it has complied with a settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appellate jurisdiction</span>. Any party may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision or order issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, or for enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. The petition must be filed promptly with the regional or field office that issued the initial decision; a copy of it must be served on the other party or that party's representative; and it must describe specifically the reasons the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance. The petition also must include the date and results of any communications regarding compliance. Any petition for enforcement that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulation was traditionally applied to Board final orders adjudicating cases in favor of appellants. The agency was supposed to certify compliance with the Board order, and then the appellant was supposed to quickly raise with the Board compliance issues. Final Board orders accepting settlements into the Board record for purposes of enforcement were gradually <span id="Page_5050"></span>brought within the scope of the Board regulation, and some agencies do get around to certifying compliance with settlements, but that is the exception. Most agencies do not send a letter or file a notice certifying compliance with a settlement, probably because the initial decision closing out a settled case simply references the acceptance of the settlement into the Board record for purpose of enforcement and dismisses the appeal as settled, but the initial decision does not order the agency to do anything (unlike a decision reversing an adverse action; then specific requirements are imposed on the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an agency violates a settlement, the appellant is entitled to file an enforcement petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whaley v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 340, 347 (1994). Assuming no certification of compliance with a settlement, enforcement petitions must be filed in a reasonable time after the alleged breach of a settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Poett v. USDA</span>, 92 MSPR 44, 46 n.* (2002) (if no deadline was set by the settlement, the petition to enforce must be filed within a reasonable time after the alleged breach, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach and the particular circumstances of the case); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 332, 334 (1996) (declining to excuse enforcement efforts brought years after the operative events); <span class="Italic">Shapira v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 136, 138-39 (1987) (rejecting, with little analysis, an enforcement action brought several years following the settlement agreement). [Refer to Chapter 1 concerning "<a href="0100-2023-08-281.html#sec1-276">Laches</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is a qualification concerning timing of an enforcement petition following a breach, and that is that the petition cannot be filed before the initial decision accepting the settlement becomes final, <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DC-0752-15-0227-C-1 n.3 (NP 5/4/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not raised by either party on review, when the appellant filed her petition for enforcement, the compliance initial decision dismissing her appeal as settled had not yet become final, and, accordingly, the administrative judge should have dismissed the petition for enforcement as premature. <span class="Italic">See Niday v. Department of the Army</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 673, 679 (1990) (finding that an appellant's contention that an agency failed to comply with a settlement agreement was premature when the initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled had not become final because the appellant had filed a petition for review); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a) (providing that a party may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision or order issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, or for enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction). However, we find that this adjudicatory error does not form a basis for reversing the compliance initial decision because it did not affect either party's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (finding that an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant seeking to enforce a settlement may await compliance, make a demand for compliance, and initiate proceedings with the Board within a reasonable time following further noncompliance. The appellant must act within a reasonable time following clear notice of repudiation of the bargain by the other party to the settlement. The Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Kasarsky v. MSPB</span>, 296 F.3d 1331, 1334-38 (Fed. Cir. 2002), that an enforcement petition alleging a breach of a settlement agreement must be filed within a reasonable time from the date the petitioning party becomes aware of a breach of the agreement, and that the reasonableness of the time period depends on the circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has not addressed the time limit within which a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement must be filed. Thus, we are faced with a question of first impression. In reaching its decision, the Board looked for guidance to an analogous regulation pertaining to enforcement of a final decision or order issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a) (2001). Under that regulation, a petition alleging a breach of a final decision "must be filed promptly" and "must describe specifically the reasons the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The regulation further provides that "[a]ny petition for enforcement that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because an agency that enters into a settlement agreement is not required to serve a notice of compliance, these provisions are not directly applicable to petitions for enforcement of settlement agreements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bostick v. Dep't of Health and Human Serv.</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 399, 401 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the above regulation does not directly apply to settlement agreements, the underlying rationale for the regulation is nevertheless instructive in the enforcement of settlement agreements. A party's obligation to abide by the terms of a settlement agreement is no less than its obligation to follow the Board's own orders. In the context of complying with an order from the Board, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.181(a) mandates that the parties "cooperate fully with each other so that compliance with the Board's orders and decisions can be accomplished promptly and in accordance with the laws, rules, and regulations that apply to individual cases." When an agency has complied with an order from the Board, the regulations require the agency to "inform the appellant promptly of the actions it takes to comply, and it must tell the appellant when it believes it has completed its compliance." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.181(b) (2001). The regulations also place a burden upon the appellant to "provide all necessary information that the agency requests in order to comply, and, if not otherwise notified, he or she should, from time to time, ask the agency about its progress." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The purpose of those provisions is to avoid unnecessary petitions for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The timeliness of a petition for enforcement of a final Board decision is measured against the date that the agency notifies the appellant of its compliance. Because the agency is not required to serve a notice of compliance in a settlement context, the timeliness of a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement must be measured against a different standard. The Board, in <span class="Italic">Adamcik v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 493 (1991), recognized this and adopted a rule governing this issue. In that case, the Board held that an enforcement petition alleging a breach of a settlement agreement which the Board retained the authority to enforce must be filed "within a reasonable amount of time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into account the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 496. The Board further noted that "[t]he reasonableness of the time period depends on the particular circumstances of the case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board, in <span class="Italic">Adamcik</span>, based its reasoning, in part, on the underlying rationale found in the regulations relating to enforcement of the Board's orders. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the rule formulated in <span class="Italic">Adamcik</span> draws reasonable parallels to and is consistent with the underlying rationale found in regulations relating to enforcement of Board orders, we find the reasoning expressed and the conclusions drawn by the Board in <span class="Italic">Adamcik</span> to be sound.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The limitations period for filing a petition to enforce an order of the Board is triggered by the agency's notice of compliance. Because a party who settles with an agency is entitled to expect that the agency will comply with the terms of the agreement until the party has reason to believe otherwise, it is reasonable to conclude that the limitations period for filing a petition to enforce a settlement agreement should be triggered when the party alleging a breach of the settlement agreement first becomes aware of such breach. Thus, we hold that an enforcement petition alleging a breach of a settlement agreement must be filed within a reasonable amount of time of the date the petitioning party becomes aware of a breach of the agreement. The reasonableness of the time period depends on the circumstances of each case. A petition for enforcement is presumed to be timely and subject to the jurisdiction of the Board until challenged, either by the Board on its own initiative or by the agency. As a result of such a challenge, if on its face the petition is untimely, then the burden is on the petitioner to show facts establishing why the petition is not untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the agency and Kasarsky reached a fee agreement whereby the agency would pay a fixed sum in exchange for dismissal of the fee petition. It is also undisputed that the agency did not pay Kasarsky the agreed amount. Under the rule set forth above, we must ascertain the following: Was there a breach of the settlement agreement? If there was a breach, when did the breach occur, and when did Kasarsky become aware of the breach? Finally, once Kasarsky became aware of the breach, did he thereafter file a petition for enforcement within a reasonable amount of time?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disputes involving settlement agreements are governed by contract principles<span class="Italic">. See Tiburzi v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("It is 'axiomatic that a settlement agreement is a contract.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). The contract principles involved here relate to when a contract to pay money--with no date of performance specified--is breached. A breach of contract is simply the non-performance of a contractual duty. <span class="Italic">See Franconia Assocs. v. United States</span>, 536 U.S. [129], 122 S. Ct. 1993, 2002 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second)</span> <span class="Italic">of Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 235(2) (1979) (hereinafter Restatement); J. Murray, <span class="Italic">Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 206, p. 417 (2d rev. ed. 1974)); <span class="Italic">Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. v. United Int'l Holdings, Inc.</span>, 532 U.S. 588, 596-97 (2001) (describing a breach of contract as "a simple failure to perform"). When no time for performance is specified and one party performs, the non-performing party is not in breach of the contract until either (1) the performing party demands performance within a reasonable amount of time, and the other party still fails to perform within the time specified; or (2) the non-performing party repudiates the contract, and the performing party chooses to treat the repudiation as a breach. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roehm v. Horst</span>, 178 U.S. 1, 13, 20 S. Ct. 780, 44 L. Ed. 953 (1900) (repudiation gives the promisee the right of electing either to wait until the time for the promisor's performance has arrived or to act upon the renunciation and treat it as a final assertion by the promisor that he is no longer bound by the contract). Here, the parties agree that at some point, the agency's non-performance with respect to the fee agreement amounted to a breach. The dispute centers around when that breach occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5051"></span>Certainly, the government is entitled to resolve disputes promptly and is not obligated to retain files open indefinitely. But the rule we adopt today does not leave the government subject to the whims or procrastinations of other parties to settlement agreements. The government is free to take steps to conclude open matters at any time by simply taking whatever action is called for in the agreement or by advising the contracting party that the government considers its obligations to have been satisfied. This is analogous to and no more burdensome than the obligation the government bears in the context of the enforcement of an order or decision to provide a notice of compliance before the duty to timely proceed with the filing of a petition for enforcement is triggered....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kararsky</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Arnold v. MSPB</span>, 572 Fed. Appx. 977, 981-82 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), determining that an enforcement petition is presumed to be timely filed and the burden is on the respondent to demonstrate its untimeliness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because "[a] petition for enforcement is presumed to be timely," we conclude that the initial burden to show untimeliness is on the party invoking the untimeliness defense--here, the Board or the agency. <span class="Italic">Kasarsky</span>, 296 F.3d at 1335. However, here we need not decide whether the agency established that the PFE was untimely on its face, because, even if it was facially untimely, we find that the agency failed to fully consider whether Mr. Arnold's delay in filing his PFE was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the proposition that "policy considerations counsel against dismissals for untimely filing and militate for providing employees with a hearing on the merits of their appeals" and that "broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience should be applied" when dealing with issues of timeliness. <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 183-84 (1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, "'if the employee gives a reasonable excuse for the delay, such excuse should be accepted by the presiding official, absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With these principles in mind, we conclude that the Board did not fully consider whether Mr. Arnold's ten month delay in filing his PFE was reasonable. We agree with the Board that delaying filing to save money for an attorney is not a reasonable excuse. But we hold that the Board failed to address the merits of Mr. Arnold's argument whether his reliance on the one-year time limit to challenge OWCP decisions, <span class="Italic">see</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.607(a) (2011), was reasonable. The AJ stated only that nothing in the Dismissal Order indicated that the time for filing a PFE would correspond to the time for seeking review of an OWCP decision. But that does not answer the question whether, in the absence of any instruction as to what "reasonable" means in this context, it was reasonable for Mr. Arnold to be guided by the OWCP deadline. <span class="Italic">Cf. Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583-84 (reversing and remanding where a notice stated that an appeal must be filed "within twenty (20) days" because it was unclear whether the notice meant calendar or working days). Here, Mr. Arnold's PFE was related to OWCP proceedings because the purpose of both was to obtain disability compensation. Furthermore, one-year time limits are common in a disability context, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b) (2012); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 8453. The AJ's analysis, which relied on another Board case where a ten-month delay was found to be unreasonable, does not address Mr. Arnold's argument or explain why the OWCP deadline was unreasonable for Mr. Arnold to rely upon. It thus fails to follow our instruction to consider each case according to its unique facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Kasarsky</span>, 296 F.3d at 1335.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case involves a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioner who was told only to file within a reasonable time. He had no guidance on what was reasonable. On remand, the Board must consider the facts and circumstances of this case: that Mr. Arnold was not given an indication of what a reasonable period would be; Mr. Arnold's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status; and Mr. Arnold's claim that he believed one year to be a reasonable period of time given that his OWCP claim provided a year in which to appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.; Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583; <span class="Italic">Pfaehler v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 783 F.2d 187, 189 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 966 F.2d 650, 653-54 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Because the facts of each case are different, the Board's prior determination that a ten-month delay was unreasonable does not answer the question whether Mr. Arnold had a reasonable excuse for his ten-month delay.[2]</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Martin v. USPS</span>, DC-0752-15-0108-C-2 (NP 3/9/2023), summarized how the Board views a reasonable time for initiation of an enforcement petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A petition for enforcement alleging breach of a settlement must be filed within a reasonable amount of time from the date the petitioning party becomes aware of a breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Kasarsky v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 296 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">see also Phillips v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 515, &#x00B6; 11 (2012); <span class="Italic">Eagleheart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 12 (2009). The reasonableness of the time period depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Kasarsky</span>, 296 F.3d at 1335; <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 515, &#x00B6; 11. The Board has found that a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement--filed within 4 months of a party's awareness of the breach--was filed within a reasonable time when the appellant was taking action to confirm that the breach had occurred. <span class="Italic">See Phillips</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 515, &#x00B6; 11. Here, nothing contradicts the appellant's assertion that she had been actively discussing with the agency how to resolve the alleged breaches of the 2016 agreement up to the date of filing her petition. Under the circumstances, we find that the petition for enforcement was filed within a reasonable amount of time. <span class="Italic">See Bostick v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 399, 402 (1994) (finding that a 4-month delay in filing a petition for enforcement was reasonable under the circumstances, though a 21-month delay was not); <span class="Italic">Chudson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 115, 118 (1996) (finding that a 1-year delay in filing a petition for enforcement was unreasonable when the appellant was an experienced Board litigant and was represented by counsel), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 132 F.3d 54 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained its position as to the timeliness of a petition to enforce a settlement in <span class="Italic">Adamcik v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 493, 496-98 (1991), concluding that the petition must be filed within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach, and offering some guidance concerning responses to enforcement submissions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations provide that any petition for enforcement of a Board final decision that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice of compliance must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). When the Board introduced this provision into its regulations, it explained that the parties to Board appeals have a responsibility to cooperate to assure that compliance is obtained promptly and completely. The Board also noted that the provision serves to improve the process, and shorten the time frame for the settlement of and adjudication of compliance disputes. <span class="Italic">See</span> 51 Fed. Reg. 6729 (Feb. 26, 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After public comment on this provision, the Board again stated that, although there is no time limit on the Board's authority to enforce compliance, the regulation's requirements encourage timely filing of requests for compliance in order to assure prompt resolution of compliance matters for the benefit of all concerned. <span class="Italic">See</span> 51 Fed. Reg. 25146 (Jul. 10, 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The underlying rationale for the regulation is equally applicable to enforcement of settlement agreements. Agencies that enter into settlement agreements are not required to serve notice of compliance. Thus, the time period for filing a petition for enforcement in a settled case cannot be identical to that of the regulation. The date of the alleged breach and/or the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach, can usually be identified, however. Also, in situations where a settlement agreement requires action by the agency, the Board has held that 30 days is a reasonable time in which to comply. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Graff v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 639 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we do not here set a specific time limit for the filing of a petition for enforcement by a party alleging breach of a settlement agreement which the Board retained authority to enforce, we hold that such petition must be filed within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. Veterans Administration</span>, 35 MSPR 136, 138 (1987) (the administrative judge properly dismissed as untimely a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement filed two years after the date of the alleged breach). The reasonableness of the time period depends on the particular circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency actions which form the basis of the appellant's allegations of breach of the settlement agreement occurred as follows: The agency returned the appellant to EAS 18, step 5, on August 12, 1989; the PS-50 that the appellant complains erroneously refers to her downgrade is dated December 21, 1989; and the agency reassigned the appellant on December 12, 1989. The appellant's petition for enforcement was filed on June 7, 1990, about 6 months after she was aware of the reassignment, the agency's last alleged breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the record establishes that, 4 months before the appellant filed the petition for enforcement, she viewed the reassignment as retaliation. On January 30, 1990, she filed an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint alleging that the reassignment was retaliation for filing earlier EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's acknowledgment order did not give the <span id="Page_5052"></span>appellant notice of the timeliness issue or afford her the opportunity to show good cause for the apparently delayed filing.... We therefore remand the case to the administrative judge for issuance of a show cause order and a determination as to whether the appellant filed within a reasonable time under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Board finds that the administrative judge erred in failing to afford the appellant an opportunity to submit evidence and argument in response to the agency's final submission. The Board's regulations provide that the procedures for processing petitions for enforcement include: the initial petition; a reply to the petition by the allegedly noncomplying party with evidence of compliance, evidence of partial compliance and a reasonable schedule for full compliance, or a statement showing good cause for noncompliance; and the petitioner's response to the allegedly noncomplying party's evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge allowed the agency to file a rebuttal to the appellant's response to its evidence of compliance. Although such a filing is not specifically permitted by the Board's regulations, the administrative judge has wide discretion in directing the course of the appeal proceedings and we find that she did not abuse her discretion here in allowing the submission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 MSPR 280, 283 (1988). We find, however that the administrative judge erred in failing to afford the appellant an opportunity to respond to the additional evidence in the agency's rebuttal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lyon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 MSPR 77 (1988). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Naekel v.

As noted above, the Board's regulations prescribe that the petitioner will have an opportunity to respond to the allegedly non-complying party's evidentiary submissions. Where, as here, supplementary submissions are permitted, the right to respond also must be afforded.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ is concerned about the timeliness of an enforcement petition, the AJ should provide the appellant with notice of a timeliness issue involving a petition to enforce a settlement and an opportunity to show good cause for a filing delay. <span class="Italic">Maddox v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Olson v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 383, 389 (1995), summarized the Board's approach toward timeliness of petitions seeking enforcement of settlements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Allegations of noncompliance with a settlement agreement are properly a matter for initial consideration by the regional office on a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 109, 112 (1992).

Because an agency that enters into a settlement agreement is not required to serve a notice of compliance, the time period for filing a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement cannot track the express requirements of these regulations. Rather than set a specific time limit for the filing of such a petition, the Board has stated that the petition must be filed "within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach," and that the "reasonableness of the time period depends on the particular circumstances of the case." <span class="Italic">See Bostick v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 63 MSPR 399, 401 (1994), citing <span class="Italic">Adamcik v. US Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 493, 496 (1991).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The question becomes whether the 4-month period between the appellant's receipt of the draft written version of the settlement agreement and his initial filing of noncompliance allegations with the Board means that his filing was untimely. A petition for enforcement alleging a breach of a settlement agreement must be filed within a reasonable period of time from the date the party alleging breach had <span class="Italic">actual</span> knowledge of a specific act that constituted a breach, not merely an unsubstantiated suspicion that a breach had occurred. <span class="Italic">Poett v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An Order and Summary of Telephonic Status Conference indicates that the appellant stated during that telephone conference that a former co-worker called him in late 2000 and told him that he (the co-worker) was told the terms of the appellant's settlement agreement. While a sworn statement by the appellant's former co-worker reveals that, in November 2000, Letsky told him that the appellant had settled for $2000, there is no evidence in the record reflecting when the former co-worker reported this to the appellant. The appellant apparently also stated during the telephonic status conference that he did not file a petition for enforcement in March 2001, when he received a copy of the draft settlement agreement and discovered the breach of the confidentiality provision, because he was "given the run-around" by the union and his former representative.[2] In his submissions, the appellant has contended that he was unaware of the terms of the settlement agreement until he received the draft from his representative in March 2001. Thereafter, the appellant alleges that he attempted to contact his representative, the agency, and the union in an effort to determine what had happened with regard to the settlement of his case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Additionally, the appellant asserted that he was hit by a car in March 2000, which left him permanently disabled and delayed his original appeal until August 2000. In one of the documents the appellant submitted to the administrative judge in July 2001, he indicated that he had been on powerful pain medications due to the accident for much of the past year. It is unclear, however, what impact, if any, this had on the appellant's ability to file his July 2001 submissions with the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances presented, <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 556, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 52 Fed. Appx. 148 (Fed. Cir. 2002), is instructive. In that case, the appellant first learned that his employing agency had possibly breached the parties' settlement agreement in 1997 and took steps other than filing a petition for enforcement to pursue the matter. <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 556 &#x00B6; 3. The appellant eventually filed a petition for enforcement with the Board in 1999. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the administrative judge found that the appellant believed he was pursuing a reasonable course of action to obtain proof of noncompliance from 1997 to 1999, he held that the delay in filing a petition for enforcement rendered it untimely. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) disagreed and found that the appellant did not unreasonably delay filing his petition for enforcement because he pursued a reasonable course of action after he first received information indicating that the agency may have violated the settlement agreement and then filed his petition for enforcement within a reasonable time "after it became clear that the course he had taken would not resolve the question of whether a breach had occurred." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 7 (citing <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v. Department of Justice</span>, No. 00-3385, 2001 WL 1313663, at *1, *3 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 19, 2001) (Table)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the appellant in this matter received the draft settlement agreement from his representative in March 2001, which coupled with the information that Letsky was revealing the terms of the settlement to others, may have led him to suspect that the agency had breached the confidentiality provision. The appellant asserts that he then made numerous attempts to contact his representative, the representative's supervisor, the agency, and the union to determine exactly what had occurred regarding the settlement of his case. When he did not receive the information he sought, he wrote to the administrative judge in July 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant sent letters to the administrative judge alleging noncompliance no more than 4 months after he first received the draft written settlement agreement, it is uncertain exactly when, after he received the draft, he realized that a settlement containing terms similar to those in the draft version had already occurred. It nonetheless appears that, between March 2001 and July 2001, he was reasonably attempting to ascertain what had transpired regarding the settlement of his appeal. Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the appellant filed his July 2001 allegations of noncompliance within a reasonable period of time. Because the petition for enforcement was timely with respect to the appellant's assertion that the agency breached the confidentiality provision of the agreement, remand for further adjudication of that allegation is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5053"></span>The second issue in this case is whether the appellant's allegation that the agency breached the agreement's payment provision was timely raised. The record indicates that the appellant first mentioned the agency's alleged failure to pay him in accordance with the settlement agreement in his October 2002 petition for enforcement. The appellant contends that he never had an opportunity to complain about the nonpayment before because everyone he attempted to contact about it ignored him or "passed the buck." He also asserts that, after numerous unsuccessful attempts to contact his representative, he asked the agency to send him a copy of the signed settlement agreement, but the agency did not reply. From this document, it appears that at least as of January 7, 2003, the appellant was still unaware that the settlement in this matter was oral. On the other hand, the appellant's October 2002 petition for enforcement indicates the appellant received a copy of an "oral conference" from the Board, which could be the conference where the oral settlement occurred. The appellant did not state when he received a copy of this "oral conference," however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear when the appellant realized that a settlement had occurred and what the actual terms of the settlement agreement were. Although he apparently received a written draft settlement agreement from his representative in March 2001, it appears that he did not immediately realize that a settlement had already occurred. It is also uncertain whether he knew that the terms set forth therein were the terms to which the parties had orally agreed on November 8, 2000. In fact, there were some significant differences between the oral settlement agreement in the record and the written draft the appellant received. For example, the written draft indicated that the appellant would submit a letter of resignation, though no date was given for doing so, and that the agency would pay the appellant $2000 within 6 weeks after the final signature was placed on the agreement. The oral settlement agreement, however, provided that the appellant would submit a letter of resignation with an effective date to be determined by the appellant prior to November 8, 2000. The oral agreement further provided that the agency would pay the appellant $2000 within 6 weeks of November 8, 2000. Therefore, if the appellant had only seen his representative's draft agreement, he would not have been aware that he was entitled to payment within 6 weeks after November 8, 2000. He may have been under the misapprehension that he had to sign the agreement to receive payment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are some similarities between this case and <span class="Italic">Kasarsky</span>. In <span class="Italic">Kasarsky</span>, the parties reached an agreement on the merits of the case and entered it into the record for enforcement purposes. 296 F.3d at 1332. The agency reduced the agreement to writing and sent the appellant a final, presumably signed, version in July 1997. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In October 1997, the parties entered into an agreement orally on the record regarding attorney fees, but no time was specified for the agency's payment of such fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1333. In December 1999, the appellant finally signed the written settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In January and February 2001, the appellant's attorney reminded the agency of its agreement regarding attorney fees and set a deadline for payment of March 5, 2001. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> When the agency failed to pay, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement in April 2001, which the Board dismissed as untimely. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1333-34. The Federal Circuit reversed the Board's decision and held that the agency did not breach the agreement until the appellant made a demand for payment by a date certain and the agency failed to pay by that date. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1337-38. The Federal Circuit further found that the appellant could not be charged with actual knowledge of the breach until he set a firm deadline for the agency's performance and the agency failed to meet it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> From that point, the appellant had a reasonable time for filing a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1338-39.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In March 2001, after the appellant received the draft written version of the settlement agreement and had heard from a former co-worker that an agency supervisor was discussing details of his settlement, he should have had a suspicion that there was an agreement which contained a payment provision that may have been breached. However, as stated previously, it is unclear when, if ever, the appellant learned that the agency was supposed to pay him within 6 weeks of the November 8, 2000 settlement, as the written draft he received contains a payment time linked to the signing of the written draft, which never occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it appears that the appellant may have eventually received a copy of the audiotape containing the settlement agreement in this matter, it is not certain whether he did. A determination of when he received it or some other representation of the agreement's actual terms, if ever, is necessary to determine when he had actual knowledge of an agency breach of the payment provision. Therefore, the Board remands this issue for the administrative judge to give the parties an opportunity to submit evidence and argument regarding (1) whether the agency breached the agreement's payment provision, (2) if there was a breach, when the appellant became aware of it, which will in part be determined by when the appellant became aware of the terms of the actual oral settlement agreement, and (3) once the appellant became aware of the breach, whether he filed a petition for enforcement within a reasonable period of time thereafter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kasarsky</span>, 296 F.3d at 1335-36. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant filed his petition for enforcement within a reasonable period of time after he had actual knowledge of a breach of the payment provision, the administrative judge shall adjudicate that issue on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bostick v. DHHS</span>, 63 MSPR 399, 401-02 (1994), provides another example of how the Board assesses timeliness of a petition seeking settlement enforcement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board regulations provide that a petition for enforcement of a final decision that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice of compliance must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). Because an agency that enters into a settlement agreement is not required to serve a notice of compliance, the time period for filing a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement cannot track the express requirements of these regulations. Rather than set a specific time limit for the filing of such a petition, the Board has stated that the petition must be filed "within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach," and that the "reasonableness of the time period depends on the particular circumstances of the case." <span class="Italic">Adamcik v. United States Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 493, 496 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant concedes that he was aware in December 1991 that the agency had upgraded the RMO position without upgrading his own Deputy RMO position, and that he waited 21 months before filing his petition for enforcement challenging this alleged breach. Moreover, although the appellant asserts that he did not realize there was a problem with the grading of his position until the subsequent delegation problems arose, he elsewhere notes that he actually suspected the agency of bad faith on this score even before it had completed the upgrade of the RMO position. Although the appellant did not receive notice of a specific time period for filing a petition to enforce compliance with the settlement agreement, he was notified of his general right to file such a petition, and his failure to do so for 21 months does not satisfy the standard of reasonableness set forth in <span class="Italic">Adamcik</span>. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the part of the initial decision in which the administrative judge found that the appellant had not filed his petition for enforcement within a reasonable time after this alleged breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also concedes that he discovered the agency was withholding the authority he allegedly needed to perform the duties of his position in May 1993 and that he filed his petition for enforcement some four months later. He notes, however, that he filed a grievance concerning the matter in June 1993, and that he filed his petition for enforcement only 10 days after he received the agency's decision on that grievance. It is true that the pursuit of other avenues of redress, including the grievance process, generally does not constitute good cause for waiving the Board's filing deadline<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Bachelor v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 MSPR 108, 110 (1992). As we have noted above, however, the appellant in this case received only the more general information about petitions for enforcement that is provided in cases involving settlement agreements, and not the more specific information provided in other cases. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant acted within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach....</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 493, 496 (1991), the Board found that a distinction exists between enforcement petitions of settlement agreements and enforcement petitions of other Board decisions because agencies that enter into settlement agreements are not required to serve notice of compliance on the appellant. The Board, therefore, held that the time period for filing a petition for enforcement in a settled case cannot be identical to that of the Board's regulation in 1201.182(a), and that a petition for enforcement in a settled case must be filed within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Resort to OSC may not excuse an appellant's delay in seeking Board enforcement of a settlement, <span class="Italic">Chudson v. EPA</span>, 71 MSPR 115, 118-19 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant states on review that he discovered the agency's alleged breach upon receiving the Department of State's August 11, 1994 <span id="Page_5054"></span>response to his FOIA request. He asserts that this response "demonstrated breach of the settlement agreement by [the agency] and Whistleblower Protection Act violations by the Department of State." Instead of filing a petition for enforcement concerning the agency's alleged breach, the appellant elected to file a whistleblower complaint with the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) on August 31, 1994<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. This appeal followed nearly 1 year later on August 21, 1995. We find that this explanation does not show good cause for the appellant's 1-year delay in filing once he learned of the agency's alleged breach<span class="Italic">. Bostick</span>, 63 MSPR at 402.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is represented by counsel. He has filed a number of appeals with the Board, including two prior petitions for enforcement. Therefore, it cannot be said that he is unaware of the Board's procedures for filing a petition for enforcement. Moreover, in light of the appellant's familiarity with Board procedures and his tenacious pursuit of his appeal rights in the past, his decision to seek enforcement of the agency's alleged breach of the settlement agreement with OSC, rather than with the Board, does not reflect ordinary prudence or due diligence under the circumstances, particularly in light of the lengthy delay in this case. The Board has held that an employee's pursuit of his appeal rights in another forum does not constitute good cause for untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Waldon v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 478, 479 (1994), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 36 F.3d 1112 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Shimmin v.

US Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 555, 560 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has not demonstrated good cause for the untimeliness of his petition for enforcement. Accordingly, the appellant's petition for enforcement is dismissed. Although the appellant's petition for enforcement is dismissed as to this alleged breach of the settlement agreement, the agreement remains valid and its provisions continue to control any future actions of the parties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 332, 336 (1996) (untimely petition to enforce a settlement: "The appellant's pursuit of his claims through other agencies similarly provides no basis for waiving the filing deadline.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nevertheless, the appellant need not rush to enforcement proceedings. He may wait until it is reasonably apparent that there has been a violation of the settlement, and he may seek some internal redress within an agency before invoking the Board's procedures, <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3385):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, a petition for enforcement of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board must be filed within 30 days after the agency serves its notice of compliance with the decision. Any petition filed after that time must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). Because an agency that enters into a settlement agreement is not required to serve a notice of compliance, there is no strict time limit on filing a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement; instead, the Board has held that such a petition must be filed within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Adamcik v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 493, 496 (1991). The reasonableness of the time period depends on when the petitioning party learned of the alleged breach and the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case concluded that Mr. Fitzpatrick "was aware of the agency's alleged noncompliance approximately two years before he filed the petition for enforcement" and for that reason concluded that the delay of two years in filing the petition for enforcement was unreasonable. We disagree with the administrative judge's ruling. Although it is true that Mr. Fitzpatrick had information in 1997 that led him to suspect that the settlement agreement may have been breached, he did not have conclusive evidence of a violation. Indeed, the government acknowledged as much at oral argument, pointing out that Mr. Fitzpatrick's suspicion was based only on "second-or third-hand hearsay." Thus, we do not agree with the apparent conclusion of the administrative judge that Mr. Fitzpatrick had notice of a violation of the settlement agreement in September 1997. Nor do we agree with the government's suggestion that the time for filing a petition for enforcement ran from the time Mr. Fitzpatrick first had reason to suspect that the government may have breached the settlement agreement. Instead, it was reasonable for him to take other steps to attempt to confirm that a violation had occurred before filing a petition for enforcement. Although the course of action he pursued--raising the issue with the United States Attorney's office, which referred the matter to the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility--may not have been the most effective course to follow, it was a step that was reasonably designed to determine whether there had been an improper disclosure of matters that should not have been contained in his personnel file. When that inquiry neither confirmed his suspicions nor allayed his concerns, he sought confirmation by another means--requesting a copy of his personnel file from the FBI--but he received no satisfactory response to that request either. Shortly after requesting a copy of his personnel file and receiving no response, he filed his petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If it had been clear in 1997 that the settlement agreement had been violated, it would have been reasonable for the Board to conclude that a two-year delay in filing the petition for enforcement rendered the petition untimely. In light of the fact that the evidence of a breach of the agreement that Mr. Fitzpatrick had in 1997 was inconclusive, however, he acted reasonably in taking measures designed to confirm his suspicions before filing a petition for enforcement. Mr. Fitzpatrick filed his petition within a reasonable period after it became clear that neither the OPR investigation nor Mr. Fitzpatrick's request for access to his official personnel file was going to give him the means to determine for sure whether there had been a violation of the settlement agreement. Under those circumstances, we conclude that the Board abused its discretion by concluding that Mr. Fitzpatrick should have filed his petition for enforcement at some earlier point in the process and that the petition he filed in August 1999 was untimely. We therefore remand the case for the Board to address whether the settlement agreement was or is being violated, and if so, what remedy may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Barring settlement of the enforcement petition or dismissal of the petition for lack of timeliness, the AJ is required to issue an enforcement decision specifically resolving the issues raised by appellant's petition. If it is unclear what has been resolved through the AJ's initial decision, and the compliance problem first raised persists, the appellant may file a second enforcement petition rather than a PFR challenging the initial decision that recited a resolution of the first compliance issue, <span class="Italic">Summerset v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 509, 512 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding that the enforcement matter was "satisfactorily resolved" as of December 29, 1993, did not preclude the appellant from filing a later petition claiming that the agency was still not in compliance. The compliance initial decision did not make a specific finding that the agency had complied with its obligations under the settlement agreement as of December 29, and no such finding can be implied, in light of the notice to the appellant that, "If the agency has not fully complied with the terms of the agreement after this initial decision has become final, you may ask the Board to enforce the settlement agreement by filing a motion with this office." It is clear from this language that the agency had not yet satisfied all of its obligations under the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Salsbury v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 459, 462 &#x00B6; 7 (2004), the AJ adjudicated (against the appellant) one theory of noncompliance with a settlement, and the appellant raised another theory of noncompliance in the PFR. The Board sent the case back to the AJ to adjudicate the newly-raised compliance argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further contends, for the first time in his petition for review, that the agency breached the following provision of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Parties agree that any employment inquires about the Appellant will be directed to Human Resources at Hines Hospital at 708-202-2539.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, the appellant's position is that the agency violated the agreement by failing to ensure that the contractor who answered the phone would refer the caller to Human Resources. The appellant had the opportunity to make this argument below to the administrative judge, either in his initial filing, or in response to the show-cause order. Because the appellant has not shown that his new argument is based on information that was previously unavailable despite his due diligence, we will not consider it<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980). Rather, we find that this claim of agency noncompliance is properly a matter for consideration by the administrative judge as a new petition for enforcement<span class="Italic">. See Davis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 627, 631-32 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An enforcement petition may be withdrawn. It will not be reinstated without good reason. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zapata v.

Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 5 (2012). Although his reasons for withdrawing his petition for enforcement are unclear, the appellant has not alleged that he did so involuntarily.
