<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-37"><span class="space">4.</span> Employees Engaged in Personnel Work; 5 USC 7112(b)(3)</h4>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7112(b)(3) precludes recognized units from including "an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity." A decision that excluded from a unit management analysts who determined whether unit work should be contracted out summarized the rules governing exclusion of employees involved in personnel work, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq., 101st Airborne Div., Ft. Campbell and AFGE Local 2022</span>, 36 FLRA 598, 602-03 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7112(b)(3) of the Statute, a unit will not be found to be appropriate if it includes an employee directly involved in performing personnel work affecting the bargaining unit and making recommendations to management concerning such personnel actions....&#8197;A position is excluded under section 7112(b)(3) when the character and extent of involvement of the incumbent is more than clerical in nature and the duties of the position in question are performed in a nonroutine manner or are of such a nature as to create a conflict of interest between the incumbent's union affiliation and job duties....&#8197;Further, incumbents who exercise independent judgment and discretion in initiating personnel actions or making recommendations to management on personnel actions are excluded from the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of employees engaged in personnel work, <span class="Italic">VA No. Cal. Health Care Sys. and AFGE</span>, 66 FLRA 522, 524 (2012) (Member Beck dissenting) (overruled by <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 465 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (limiting exemption to purely clerical or similar duties) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 960 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)), emphasized the exclusion depends on the exercise of judgment and discretion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Regarding employees involved in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity, the Authority has held that the character and extent of the employee's involvement in personnel work must be more than clerical in nature, and the position's duties must not be performed in a routine manner; the employee must exercise independent judgment and discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA</span>, 56 FLRA at 1018; <span class="Italic">accord U.S. Dep't of Agric., Forest Serv., Albuquerque Serv. Ctr., Human Capital Mgmt., Albuquerque, N.M.</span>, 64 FLRA 239, 242 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Agric.</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">VA No. Cal. Health Care Sys.</span>, Member Beck, dissenting, argued for a less restrictive definition of the exclusion, 66 FLRA at 525-27:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I disagree with my colleagues that the Assistants should be included in the bargaining unit. In my view, these individuals are engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that I articulated in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Albuquerque Service Center, Human Capital Management, Albuquerque, New Mexico,</span> 64 FLRA 239, 243 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Agric</span>.) (Concurring Opinion of Member Beck), I do not believe that our current precedent concerning &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) is consistent with the plain language of the Statute. I also do not believe that the Authority has interpreted the exclusion for "personnel work" as broadly as was intended by Congress. As a result, reconsideration of our precedent is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(b)(3) excludes from a bargaining unit employees who are "engaged in personnel work in other than a <span class="Italic">purely clerical </span>capacity." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) (emphasis added). The term "clerical" is defined as "of <span id="Page_44"></span>or relating to a clerk," and the term "clerk" is defined as "one employed to keep records or accounts or to perform general office work." Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 155 (1971) (<span class="Italic">Webster's</span>). Moreover, the word "purely" is defined as "merely, solely." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 693. Based on these definitions, duties such as typing, processing paperwork, and filing are purely clerical. In contrast, duties such as evaluating, advising, and recommending; assessing and classifying; and performing research and reviews clearly are not. Yet, our precedent has erroneously found that employees performing these latter duties may not be excluded from a bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Agric.</span>, 64 FLRA at 243; <span class="Italic">Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., S.F., Cal.</span>, 49 FLRA 1598, 1602 (1994) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, in some instances in which the "personnel work" exclusion was invoked by an agency, the Authority has failed even to examine whether the duties performed were "purely clerical" in nature. In such cases, the Authority simply concluded that employees were not excluded from the bargaining unit because the duties they performed were routine and did not require the exercise of independent judgment and discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Marion, Ill.</span>, 55 FLRA 1243, 1247 (2000) (finding that employees did not exercise independent judgment and discretion without discussing whether employees' duties, namely developing the training plan and counseling employees regarding training requirements, constituted purely clerical duties); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Wash., D.C. &#x0026; Internal Revenue Serv., Cincinnati Dist., Cincinnati, Ohio</span>, 36 FLRA 138, 144-45 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) (upholding the RD's determination that the employees performed their duties in a routine manner and were not required to exercise independent judgment and discretion in carrying out their duties without discussing whether their duties were purely clerical).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also has created too high a standard for determining whether the duties the employees perform are routine. The word "routine" is defined as the "habitual or mechanical performance of an established procedure." <span class="Italic">Webster's </span>at 750. Our precedent has concluded that duties are routine whenever employees, in performing such duties, rely on guidelines or regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Agric.,</span> 64 FLRA at 241-42 (finding that duties were routine when employees performed those duties in accordance with established guidelines); <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 36 FLRA at 145 (determining that duties were routine when employees performed those duties in accordance with regulations and established guidelines). But such analysis fails to consider the extent of the employee's reliance on those guidelines and regulations. Merely following by rote a pre-established checklist should be considered a routine duty; however, interpreting and analyzing various guidelines and regulations should not be considered routine.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Authority has created too high a standard for determining whether employees exercise independent judgment and discretion. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206, employees exercise independent judgment and discretion simply by comparing and evaluating "possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision [or recommendation] after the various possibilities have been considered." <span class="Italic">See also Webster's </span>at 459 (defining the term "judgment" simply as "the process of forming an opinion or evaluation by discerning and comparing"); <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 238 (defining the word "discretion" as "individual choice or judgment"). Yet our precedent implicitly requires that an employee must exercise <span class="Italic">substantial </span>independent judgment and discretion in order for that employee to be exempt from a bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 63 FLRA 356, 360-61 (2009) (finding that employees exercised independent judgment when they made recommendations to management and their recommendations had a significant effect on personnel decisions); <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 49 FLRA at 1601-02 (concluding that, even though an employee served as a resource person for time and attendance matters and other administrative subjects and assisted the labor staff, he was not exempt because he was not required to exercise independent judgment or discretion to any <span class="Italic">significant </span>degree in carrying out those duties).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) as written and intended by Congress, I would find that the Assistants in this case should be excluded from the bargaining unit because the duties that they perform are not <span class="Italic">purely clerical</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Recruitment Assistants do perform some clerical duties, several of the duties that they perform are not clerical. Specifically, Recruitment Assistants "advise managers and administrative employees on appropriate staffing methods for recruitment actions"; verify the basic qualifications of applicants applying for positions above the GS-5 level; determine what qualification standards are necessary and incorporate those standards into announcements for GS-5 positions and below; decide which KSAs to include in those announcements; rate applicants who apply for those positions; and develop a certificate of eligibles from those applicants. Similarly, Benefits Assistants perform several duties that are not clerical, including informing employees of their eligibility for various benefits; "advis[ing] employees [regarding] what constitutes a qualifying life event and...what changes they can make outside of open season"; and examining "court orders[,] such as divorce decrees[,] to make sure that requested or continued benefits are legally appropriate." Finally, Pre-Employment Assistants also perform both clerical and non-clerical duties. The non-clerical duties that they perform include interpreting and applying regulations and licensing board criteria to decide whether prospective and current employees have the proper licensure and certifications; preparing a fact sheet with their findings; and making recommendations to their supervisors regarding whether regulations and licensing board criteria have been met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, all of the Assistants exercise independent judgment and discretion. Recruitment Assistants determine what advice to give to supervisors regarding the hiring process, decide how to answer applicants' questions regarding their qualifications for vacant positions, and elect what qualification standards and KSAs to use for vacant GS-5 positions and below and determine how to rate and rank applicants for those positions. Benefits Assistants analyze whether employees are eligible for benefits, determine what changes employees "can make outside of open season," and interpret court documents to determine whether "requested or continued benefits are legally appropriate." Additionally, Pre-Employment Assistants decide whether candidates and employees have the proper licenses and certifications, draft a fact sheet with their findings, and present recommendations to their supervisors regarding whether regulations and licensing board criteria have been met. Moreover, while Assistants may discuss difficult issues with their supervisors, their supervisors' involvement does not diminish the independent judgment and discretion that these employees exercise. <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206(c) (indicating that, with regard to the Fair Labor Standards Act's administrative exemption, "an employee can exercise discretion and independent judgment even if the employee's decisions or recommendations are reviewed at a higher level").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Assistants' duties are not routine. Although the Assistants refer to regulations and guidelines in performing their duties, they do not use these regulations and guidelines in a completely mechanical manner. In answering applicants' questions, Recruitment Assistants "utilize various federal and [Activity] guidelines, rules[,] and regulations and may have to research those sources in order to provide answers" to applicants. Benefits Assistants research and apply government-wide regulations to determine whether employees have a legal entitlement to benefits. Additionally, Pre-Employment Assistants evaluate whether employees have the appropriate certifications and licensure in accordance with applicable regulations and licensing board criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, I would find that the Assistants are engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) of the Statute and that, as a result, the Assistants are excluded from membership in the bargaining unit.[*]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] Because I would find the Assistants are excluded on this basis, I would find it unnecessary to address the Agency's remaining arguments, namely whether the Assistants are excluded from the bargaining unit under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(2) and whether there is a conflict of interest between their union affiliation and job duties. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 17 FLRA 239, 240 (1985) (finding it unnecessary to address whether program analysts were confidential employees or management officials after finding that they were excluded from the bargaining unit under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent">The exclusion of employees involved in personnel work extends to those involved in internal personnel work, but not to those whose work involves the formation of policies for other agencies in an advisory capacity and whose work does not have a direct impact on the employees of their own agency. <span class="Italic">OPM and AFGE</span>, 5 FLRA 238, 245 (1981). The exclusion extends to those individuals doing personnel work for units of an agency that involve employees who are not in the bargaining unit represented by the union that seeks to represent the personnelists, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, North Central CPO Ctr., Rock Island and AFGE Local 15</span>, 59 FLRA 296, 296, 301-03 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By order dated August 9, 2002, the Authority granted the United States Department of the Army's (Agency's) application for review of the Regional Director's (RD's) decision granting, in part, the Union's petition for review. In granting review, the Authority asked the parties to submit additional briefs addressing the following question:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 7112(b)(3) of the Statute provides that a bargaining unit is not appropriate if it includes "an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity[.]" Does section 7112(b)(3) operate to exclude employees who perform personnel work concerning other employees of the same agency who are not included in the bargaining unit at issue? In this regard, does the term "personnel work" refer to personnel work of the agency or only to work that concerns other employees of the same bargaining unit?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we find that &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) excludes all employees performing personnel work, in other than a purely clerical <span id="Page_45"></span>capacity, concerning other employees of the same agency irrespective of whether those other employees are included in the bargaining unit at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(b)(3) of the Statute provides that a bargaining unit may not be found appropriate if it includes "an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity[.]" As noted in our decision granting the Agency's application for review in this case, the Authority has not previously decided a case involving &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) where the disputed employees performed personnel work relating to other employees in their agency who were outside of the bargaining unit in question. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that such employees are excluded from appropriate units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In interpreting the Statute, we begin with its wording<span class="Italic">. See United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Dev. Cent. Serv. Ctr., St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 57 FLRA 166, 168 (2001). In this regard, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) provides that a bargaining unit is not appropriate if it includes "an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity[.]" Nothing in this wording supports a conclusion that the exclusion depends in any way on the unit status of the employee(s) for whom personnel work is being performed. The terms of the Statute, thus, provide no support for the qualification urged by the Union and adopted by the Regional Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 5 FLRA 238, the Authority addressed whether employees who were not involved in doing OPM's internal personnel work, but rather did work related to OPM's mission of delivering (external) personnel assistance to other agencies, should be excluded on the basis of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3). In reviewing the history and meaning of this provision, the Authority held that such external personnel work was not excluded based on the historical treatment of these employees as members of bargaining units prior to the enactment of the Statute in 1978, and the fact that nothing in the Statute or its legislative history indicated that Congress intended to change this past practice<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 245. In this regard, the Authority noted that "[t]he practice of excluding from bargaining units employees engaged in Federal personnel work has been a part of the formalized Federal service labor-management program since its inception in 1962[,]" and that "[t]hroughout the Federal service, implementation of these provisions [in Executive Orders preceding the Statute] resulted in the exclusion from bargaining units of employees of an agency who did personnel work within that agency.<span class="Italic">" Id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority subsequently stated the test for exclusion under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) in a way that implies that exclusion may depend on the unit status of the employees for whom personnel work is performed<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Army, Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division, Ft. Campbell, Ky.</span>, 36 FLRA 598, 602 (1990) (holding that employees are properly excluded from a bargaining unit under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) when such employees are "directly involved in performing personnel work affecting the bargaining unit..."). In each of these cases, however, the dispute concerned employees who clearly were performing personnel work affecting employees in the same bargaining unit<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 604<span class="Italic">. See also Social Security Admin.</span>, 17 FLRA 239, 240 (1985); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region X, Seattle, Wash.</span>, 9 FLRA 518, 524 (1982). Thus, the statements in those decisions that performing personnel work "affecting the bargaining unit" resulted in exclusion may be explained as statements of fact, not findings that such facts were necessary for the exclusion to apply in the first place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">None of the parties to this case has provided a basis for modifying the Authority's conclusion in OPM that employees who perform personnel work relating directly to the personnel operations of their own employing agency are to be excluded from bargaining units. In particular, we reject the Union's argument that it is necessary to make a case-by-case determination of whether the particular work of particular employees would create a conflict of interest in applying &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3). The Statute reflects the intent of Congress to preclude employees engaged in personnel work from bargaining units when the work they perform for the agency is more than purely clerical. If Congress had intended to require individual conflict-of-interest determinations, then Congress could have modified the wording of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) to do so, as it did by requiring the determination that personnel work be performed "in other than a purely clerical capacity."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing principles to this case, there is no dispute that, as the Regional Director found, the employees in question, who are assigned to the U.S. Department of the Army's North Central Civilian Personnel Operations Center located at Rock Island, Illinois (north central region), are engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity. The Regional Director included these employees in the proposed bargaining unit because of his view that Authority precedent indicated that employees engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity are excluded from a bargaining unit only if the personnel work may affect employees in that bargaining unit. However, consistent with our decision today, the proper focus in this case is whether the personnel work performed by employees in other than a purely clerical capacity relates to their own employing agency. If it does, then Congress has mandated that such employees are excluded by &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the disputed employees provide "the full spectrum of human resource services to approximately 33,000 Army employees in the...north central region." The record confirms the Agency's explanation that the disputed employees "are recruiting for, staffing, and classifying positions within the [north central] region, and those positions are represented by labor organizations." Because the personnel work performed by these employees in other than a purely clerical capacity relates to their own employing agency, these employees are excluded by &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the employees at issue are excluded from the proposed bargaining unit by operation of &#x00A7; 7112(b)(3) of the Statute.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;Several agencies submitted briefs arguing that employees engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity should be excluded from a bargaining unit if they perform such work for any agency in the Government. As this the resolution of that issue is not necessary to decide this case, we do not address it. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Baltimore, Md.</span>, 59 FLRA No. 26, slip op. at 21 n.5 (2003) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 52 FLRA at 1106 n.12) (in light of the Authority's other determinations in the case, it was not necessary to consider argument to determine the unit status of the employees in dispute). Similarly, we need not address OPM's argument concerning the weight to be given the Assistant Secretary of Labor's decision in St. Louis Region, 2 A/SLMR 290.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 511</span>, 59 FLRA 304 (2003) (following the rationale of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 15</span> to exclude from the unit attorneys representing management before the MSPB and EEOC in cases involving employees in another agency bargaining unit).

Individuals involved in the administration of personnel matters relating exclusively to military personnel were not excluded from a unit. <span class="Italic">Army Med.

Accordingly, the Authority finds that Burns is not engaged in the kind of work which would give rise to a conflict of interest between his job responsibility and union representation.").</p>
