<p class="Body-Text">Deceit vitiates an otherwise voluntary downgrading. Incorrect information provided to the appellant concerning his pay relative to an otherwise voluntary downgrading would establish a basis to challenge the downgrading as involuntary. <span class="Italic">Bagge v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 326, 329 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 106 MSPR 520, 528-29 &#x00B6; 15, 2007 MSPB 207 (2007) (appellant presented a nonfrivolous allegation that her downgrading was involuntary because the agency misrepresented the pay rate that she would receive); <span class="Italic">Hartman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 79 MSPR 576, 582-83 (1998) (appellant was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on the basis of an allegation that the agency failed to inform him that acceptance of the offered demotion was not required and that his declination would have no effect on his entitlement to grade retention if he was involuntarily placed in a lower-grade position); <span class="Italic">Kaiser v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 440, 448 (1997) (suggesting that a demotion would be involuntary if accepted because the agency incorrectly advised the appellant that he lacked the necessary qualifications for the job at the grade level he held); <span class="Italic">Hinton-Morgan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 382, 392 (1997) (as to an assertion that the agency failed to inform the appellant that she required a state certification to hold the position: "An employee may rebut the presumption of voluntariness and establish that a reduction in grade or pay effected pursuant to her request was in fact an appealable adverse action by a showing that the action resulted from her reasonable reliance on the agency's misinformation or from the agency's failure to provide her with adequate information on which to make her choice."); <span class="Italic">Valdez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 432, 436 (1992) (appellant was misled into accepting a demotion because the agency incorrectly informed the appellant that he would not be qualified for a lateral reassignment without a loss in grade); <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 21 MSPR 187, 188 (1984) (nonfrivolous allegation of deceit was based on incorrect information from the agency concerning pay retention and the ability to appeal an action resulting from a reorganization); <span class="Italic">Salas v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 40, 42 (1982) (remanding for hearing on the voluntariness of the appellant's entry into an apprenticeship program when he alleged that the agency represented that his pay would not be cut); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McGarigle v. USPS</span>, 904 F.2d 687 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">McGarigle v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 610, 614 (1988) (remanding for hearing when the appellant alleged that he was led to believe his rate of pay would remain the same after an otherwise voluntary reassignment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Paszek v. DOD</span>, 50 MSPR 534, 538-39 (1991), the appellant accepted a downgrade to a certain grade and step. After the employee was in the position, the agency informed him that an error was made concerning the level of his salary. The salary was decreased and the employee appealed and prevailed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an action such as the appellant's reduction in grade would normally be considered a voluntary action that would not be within the Board's jurisdiction, such an action is involuntary if it was based on misinformation by the agency upon which the appellant reasonably relied to his detriment based on an objective examination of the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Barthel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 245, 253 (1988). Here, the agency action giving rise to the appellant's complaint was not the agreed-upon reduction in grade from the GS-11 to the GS-9 grade level, but, rather, the agency's subsequent correction of the administrative error it had made in setting the appellant's salary at GS-9, step 9, instead of GS-9, step 7. The agency's correction of an administrative error in setting a pay-step level does not, in itself, constitute an action over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lemon v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 44 MSPR 43, 47-48 (1990) (agency's action setting employee's pay at a lower step level amounted to a pay reduction from a rate "contrary to law or regulation" to a rate required by law or regulation under 5 CFR 752.401(b) (15), and, thus, action was not appealable to the Board). The administrative judge therefore correctly dismissed the appellant's appeal of the reduction-in-pay action for lack of jurisdiction. We find, however, that the appellant's acceptance of the GS-9 position was involuntary as the result of misinformation from agency officials upon which he reasonably relied to his detriment.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Henry v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 33 MSPR 562, 564 (1987), where the Board found that the agency's correction of an administrative error that it had made in setting the appellant's pay-step level did not constitute an appealable reduction in grade. In <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, the alleged agency misinformation did not occur with respect to the appellant's decision to ask for and accept a demotion but, rather, the error occurred with respect to a subsequent agency decision to upgrade the appellant's position to a higher grade level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that he had asked for the reduction in grade and had volunteered to pay all expenses for his relocation, but that he would not have accepted the reduction in grade if he had been informed that his rate of pay would be at the GS-9, step 7, level. The appellant's first-line supervisor in Atlanta and another employee at that office both submitted affidavits in which they said that they had personal knowledge of the reasons underlying the appellant's decision--that he had agreed to accept the new position "if they would adjust his salary, making the move a reduction in grade, but not a reduction in pay," and that he accepted the position with that understanding. Based on this clear and uncontroverted evidence, the administrative judge correctly found that: (1) The appellant was the victim of a material misrepresentation of fact by the agency; (2) he would not have accepted the position in Chicago had he been given accurate salary information by the agency; and (3) his reduction in grade therefore was involuntary and constituted a constructive adverse action appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not afford the appellant the procedural protections of 5 USC Chapter 75 in connection with his reduction in grade. Because the action was not effected in accordance with the minimum procedures that satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process, it cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v.

<p class="Body-Text">Mention was made of <span class="Italic">Paszek</span> in a similar situation involving an employee who negotiated for and received a GS-13 for a position, only to find the agency later regrading the employee to a GS-12, without due process, based on the agency's assertion that the position was advertised and should have been filled at the lower grade, <span class="Italic">Fouks v. VA</span>, 122 MSPR 483, 484-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 6-10, 2015 MSPB 37 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency selected the appellant for a Supervisory General Engineer position with the Hudson Valley Healthcare System. The appellant was a Supervisory General Engineer with the New York Harbor Healthcare System when he applied for this position. The agency states that the appellant was a General Schedule (GS) 13, step 6 at the time of his selection.<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant disagrees and states that he actually was a GS-14, step 2 at the time of his selection. The vacancy announcement stated that the position was at the GS-12 grade level with pay ranging from $77,585 to $100,859.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency appointed the appellant, effective September 22, 2013, at the GS-13, step 8 level. On May 13, 2014, the agency notified the appellant that an error had been made in setting his grade and pay and that he had only been entitled to be paid at the GS-12, step 10 level beginning September 22, 2013. The agency stated that it would make corrections effecting all personnel actions retroactive to September 22, 2013, to reflect his proper grade and step. The appellant submitted a letter of resignation on May 14, 2014. The appellant transferred to the New York Harbor Healthcare System effective May 17, 2014, at the GS-12, step 10 level. On May 31, 2014, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service notified the appellant that it would collect overpayments made to him between December 28, 2013, and May 3, 2014. The appellant filed a petition for hearing, challenging the validity of this debt collection. There is no evidence in the record regarding the outcome of this proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1921"></span>The agency claims that it demoted the appellant from GS-13, step 8 to GS-12, step 10 after it concluded that it had erred in setting his grade when he began working in a new position effective September 22, 2013, following a competitive selection process for a position that was advertised and graded at the GS-12 level. As relevant here, 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 establishes a process, including Board appeal rights, that generally applies when qualified federal employees are subjected to certain actions, including a "reduction in grade" or a "reduction in pay." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513(d). The agency argues, and the administrative judge found, that the appellant's demotion cannot be reviewed by the Board based on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15), which provides that the adverse action appeal process under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 does not apply to the "[r]eduction of an employee's rate of basic pay from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." For the following reasons, we find that the agency's action was more than just a correction to the appellant's rate of basic pay within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). <span class="Italic">See Simmons v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 5 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the appellant was "demoted" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 when he accepted the GS-12 position. That regulation, contained in the part of the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) regulations concerning pay under the GS scale, defines a demotion as a change from one GS grade to a lower GS grade, while continuously employed, with or without a reduction in pay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203. Thus, that definition notes a distinction between "grade" and "pay" and recognizes that a change in one does not necessarily require a change in the other. The adverse action procedures established in 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 similarly differentiate between a "reduction in pay" and a "reduction in grade."[1] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Under chapter 75, "grade" is defined as "a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3). It is noteworthy that this definition does not include any explicit reference to pay. The statute separately defines "pay" as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). We find that the statutory language clearly provides that chapter 75 may apply when there has been either a reduction in grade or a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The more general term, "demotion," does not appear in 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's action was undeniably a reduction in grade for the appellant. He was reduced from a GS-13 to a GS-12 because the agency determined he could not retain the higher grade while appointed to the new GS-12 position. Although he also received a corresponding reduction in his pay, that reduction was consequential to the reduction in grade. There is no general statutory or regulatory exclusion from the chapter 75 process for reductions in grade intended to correct an "administrative error," as the agency characterizes its error in this case. The exclusion contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15) is specific to a reduction in an employee's "rate of basic pay" only, and we do not find a valid basis for extending it to the circumstances of the appellant's reduction in grade, particularly given the statutory and regulatory distinctions between "grade" and "pay" discussed above.[2] The Board has recognized an exception from chapter 75 for a reduction in grade resulting from the merits of a classification decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Quinlan v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 9 (2012). But, in this appeal, it appears that the appellant's position was at all times correctly classified at a GS-12 grade, and thus that exception would not apply. Therefore, we conclude that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15) does not preclude the application of chapter 75 to the appellant's reduction in grade.[3] [4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The exclusion might have applied had the agency reduced the appellant's rate of basic pay to a rate equivalent to the GS-12, step 10 level, without a reduction in grade, and it was only the appellant's rate of basic pay that was contrary to law or regulation. According to OPM's pay tables, GS-13, steps 1, 2, and 3 had salary rates lower than GS-12, step 10 in the appellant's locality pay area for fiscal year 2013.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Gessert v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 329 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Gessert v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 2010-3115, 2011 WL 463094 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 10, 2011), in concluding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">Gessert</span>, however, is distinguishable, and we decline to follow it in this circumstance. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Gessert</span> received notice and an opportunity to respond prior to the agency action. <span class="Italic">Gessert</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 4. There was little discussion in <span class="Italic">Gessert</span> of the jurisdictional aspects of the appeal. In contrast in this appeal, the agency did not afford the appellant notice and an opportunity to respond prior to his demotion, and thus the jurisdictional question is the central question. <span class="Italic">See Simmons</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We have considered the appellant's arguments on review that his appointment at the GS-13 level was not an administrative error because the Standard Form 50 documenting his demotion also documents his conversion to a career appointment, a number of agency officials approved his grade, and the error came to management's attention via an equal employment opportunity complaint. We have considered these arguments but find that they are immaterial to the issue of the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that his demotion was involuntary based on agency-supplied misinformation</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this appeal present another issue regarding whether the appellant has been subjected to an appealable reduction in grade. Specifically, the appellant applied for a position that was advertised as only a GS-12 position, and there is evidence in the record suggesting that he may have voluntarily sought and would have accepted the position even if it had been offered to him at the GS-12, step 10 level. Generally, a reduction in grade that an employee accepts voluntarily is not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 8 (2010); <span class="Italic">see Elmore v. Department of Transportation</span>, 421 F.3d 1339, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2005). However, a reduction in grade will be considered involuntary, and an appealable adverse action, if the employee reasonably and materially relied on agency-supplied misinformation to his detriment, based on an objective evaluation of the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">Herrin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 10 (2004). This is true even though the agency, in providing the misinformation, did not intend to mislead the employee. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Based on the current record, it is unclear whether the appellant voluntarily accepted a reduction in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency admits that it supplied the appellant with misinformation regarding the grade of the position, appointed him as a GS-13, step 8, and subsequently reduced his grade to GS-12, step 10. The appellant alleges that he was offered a higher grade after negotiating with the agency and that he accepted this offer in "good faith." The record also contains the appellant's statement that "the sole reason [he] took the position was the offer of the grade 13-8." We find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that his reduction in grade was involuntary because he relied to his detriment on agency-supplied misinformation. <span class="Italic">See Paszek v. Department of Defense</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 534, 538-39 (1991) (finding that the appellant's reduction in grade was covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 based on misinformation about the corresponding rate of pay, even though the agency's correction of the rate of pay was not itself a covered action); <span class="Italic">see also Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1344 (Fed.

On remand, the administrative judge should provide notice to the parties of the jurisdictional requirements for an involuntary reduction in grade claim and an opportunity to present evidence and arguments concerning whether the appellant reasonably relied on the misinformation provided by the agency to his detriment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Herrin</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 10.

<p class="Body-Text">Demotion may be involuntary if the agency should have been aware that the appellant may have made an error in requesting a position entailing a downgrading, but the agency did nothing to clarify the employee's intent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Timberlake v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 172, 176 (1997) (employee's job bid contained conflicting information that the agency acted upon to effect a demotion). But demotion is not involuntary if it results from the employee's failure to complete a training course and the demotion is accepted as an alternative to a possible removal. The failure of the agency to provide notice to the appellant of possible appeal rights were an action to be taken against the employee had he not accepted the demotion was not the type of deceit that would establish involuntariness. Notice of an appeal right was germane to the timing of an appeal, but it was not determinative of the voluntariness of the demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lake v.

The general rule is that a reduction in an employee's rate of basic pay is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(4), 7512(4), 7513(d). However, an exception to this rule exists when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). Such an action is not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Hall v. Department of the Navy</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1997). When an agency contends that it reduced an employee's pay to correct what it believes was an error in setting pay, then the agency bears the burden of showing that it set the employee's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Lomax v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 559 (1998). The Board has held that an employee should not be forced to prove that the agency did not make an error in setting his pay because the agency is in a much better position to know why it originally set the employee's pay as it did and what later led it to conclude that it made an error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 559-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also held that an employee's seemingly voluntary reassignment to a lower-graded position will be deemed involuntary, and thus, appealable, if the employee accepted the reassignment based on the agency's misrepresentation concerning his rate of pay in the new position or if the employee had a mistaken belief about his rate of pay that the agency was in a position to correct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Goodwin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]o constitute an appealable action, a reduction in pay must be involuntary. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(9). The appellant alleged that the agency gave him the choice of either accepting the Support Specialist position at the Miami AIFSS or being removed. The fact that an employee must choose between unpleasant alternatives does not render a decision to accept the agency's proposal involuntary. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 403, 406 (1984). However, where an employee can show that the agency knew that the reason for the threatened removal could not be substantiated, the threatened action by the agency is purely coercive and the decision to accept the reassignment in lieu of removal would be involuntary. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v.

In the instant case, the appellant alleged that agency policy governing selection priority required the agency to place him in an available position with grade and pay as close to his former position as possible. The appellant's allegations specifically refer to two positions that were available after his medical disqualification and closer to his original rate of pay and grade than the position to which he was ultimately reassigned. Thus, the appellant's allegations and the evidence submitted with his appeal suggest that, rather than being subject to removal following his medical disqualification, he was entitled to be reassigned to an available, funded vacant position located in the same commuting area at his same grade and level or, if such a position was not available, to a position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level. <span class="Italic">Human Resource Policy Manual: Selection Priority</span>, EMP-1.9, &#x00A7; 4, Category 3. Therefore, the appellant has non-frivolously alleged that his decision to accept the Support Specialist position at the Miami AIFSS was based on a choice between false alternatives, i.e., a choice between removal or acceptance of the Miami AIFSS position, and, accordingly, we find that the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that his reassignment was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Gutierrez</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 604 &#x00B6; 9.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated August 7, 2007, the agency notified the appellant that her position of Management Assistant (MA), GS-6, with the Beltsville, Maryland District Office of the agency's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), was being "abolished." The agency explained that the "Compliance" functions of her position had previously "been transferred out of the district office[,]" that her position description did not accurately reflect the activities she was currently performing, and that the MA position was "technically no longer part of the district office organizational structure."<span class="Italic"></span> The agency offered the appellant the choice of two vacant positions: a GS-6 Secretary position in Lombard, Illinois, and a GS-5 Resource Management Assistant (RMA) position in the Beltsville District Office. The agency advised that if the appellant accepted reassignment to the GS-6 position, she may be entitled to moving expenses, and that if she accepted demotion to the GS-5 position, she may be entitled to pay retention. The agency further stated that "If you elect to resign or retire rather than accept either of the positions offered, the effective date can be no later than August 21, 2007."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant accepted the agency's offer of a downgrade to the GS-5 position in Beltsville, and was appointed to this position, with pay retention, effective September 16, 2007. The appellant filed an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint regarding her alleged involuntary reduction in grade on November 28, 2007. The appellant resigned, effective October 10, 2008. On December 1, 2008, the appellant's EEO complaint was amended to include the claim that her resignation was also involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After denying the agency's motion to dismiss the appeals as untimely, and following a jurisdictional hearing conducted on May 20, 2010, the administrative judge found that both the appellant's downgrade and resignation were involuntary and must be reversed by operation of law. Specifically, the administrative judge found that, by failing to place the appellant in a GS-6 MA vacancy that existed in her commuting area, the agency violated its own Work Reduction Procedures by improperly directing her reassignment to the GS-6 Secretary position in Illinois. The administrative judge found that this improperly directed reassignment resulted in the appellant's involuntary acceptance of a downgrade to the GS-5 RMA position. The administrative judge further found that, because the appellant's subsequent resignation was also obtained as a result of this improperly directed reassignment, it too was involuntary. Finally, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not establish her affirmative defenses of discrimination and retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, it is undisputed that the appellant's downgrade was not effected as a part of a RIF. The agency contends that the appellant voluntarily elected the downgrade in lieu of accepting its offer to reassign her to the GS-6 Secretary position in Illinois, pursuant to the terms of its Work Reduction Procedures. These procedures are set forth in FSIS Directive 4300.1, entitled "Reassignment of Food Inspectors in Work Reduction Situations."[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The record reflects that the agency may apply FSIS Directive 4300.1 to all FSIS employees in work reduction situations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Directive states that "[i]t is FSIS policy to avoid reductions in force, when possible, by reassignments to vacant positions at the same grade and salaries."<span class="Italic"></span> The Directive also states that it covers reassignments "to vacant positions in work reduction situations when reassignments must be made outside the commuting area[,]" and that such reassignments "will be taken when work reductions are anticipated and no placement opportunities exist within the commuting area." Agency guidance elsewhere confirms that "the work reduction process does not apply when there are vacant same graded positions within the commuting area." Directive 4300.1 also provides that an affected employee may request consideration for demotion to a vacant position at a lower grade in the same commuting area, in lieu of accepting the offer of reassignment to a position at the same grade and pay outside the commuting area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After determining that the agency advertised and filled a GS-5/6/7 MA position during the period from May through June, 2007, the administrative judge concluded that its failure to place the appellant in this position constituted a violation of FSIS Directive 4300.1. The administrative judge noted that the appellant had twice applied and been deemed qualified for this advertised position, but had not been selected. The administrative judge concluded that agency officials erroneously believed they could not simply place the appellant in the MA position at the GS-6 level because it had promotion potential to GS-7, when, in fact, "the Board has long held...that the promotion potential of a position...is irrelevant to the question of promotion because there is no guarantee of such a promotion.... Therefore, reassignment at the same grade and pay from a position <span class="Italic">without</span> promotion potential to one <span class="Italic">with</span> promotion potential <span class="Italic">is not a promotion</span>. ...And, consistently, under RIF regulations, assignment rights for displaced employees are made to positions <span class="Italic">irrespective of the promotion potential</span> of those positions...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a consequence, the administrative judge found that the appellant had been eligible for reassignment to the vacant MA position at the GS-6 level in her commuting area, and that therefore the agency violated its Work Reduction Procedures under FSIS Directive 4300.1 in directing her reassignment to the GS-6 Secretary position in Illinois. The administrative judge further found that, because there had been "no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle for appellant's directed reassignment to Chicago...[h]er 'acceptance' of a downgrade in lieu of her wrongful reassignment was, therefore, involuntary, as...improperly obtained through a directed reassignment that was not based on <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations...." <span class="Italic">See Caveney v. <span id="Page_1923"></span>Office of Administration</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 n.2 (1993) (a resignation or retirement will be deemed involuntary if it was improperly obtained though a directed reassignment that was not based on <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the agency's petition for review takes issue with the administrative judge's characterization of its offer to place the appellant in a GS-6 Secretary position in Illinois as a "directed reassignment." More significantly, however, the agency observes that the administrative judge's finding that it was required to place the appellant in the vacant GS 5/6/7 MA position in Beltsville appears to run counter to the operation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103, "Agency promotion programs." Specifically, &#x00A7; 335.103(c) provides that "competitive procedures in agency promotion plans apply to all promotions under &#x00A7; 335.102 of this part and to the following actions:...(iv) Reassignment or demotion to a position with more promotion potential than a position previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service (except as permitted by reduction-in-force regulations)...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, RIF regulations provide that when an employee is released from her competitive level as a result of a RIF, "[t]he promotion potential of [an] offered position is not a consideration in determining [the] employee's right of assignment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(a). As the administrative judge also noted, however, the downgrade at issue here was not effected as part of a RIF. In any case, we need not decide whether the administrative judge's asserted basis for finding the appellant's downgrade involuntary, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the agency's failure to place the appellant in the vacant GS 5/6/7 MA position, runs counter to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(iv), given the existence of a more fundamental alternative basis, noted by the administrative judge, for finding that the appellant's downgrade was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously set forth, the agency, upon notifying the appellant that her GS-6 MA position had been abolished, effectively offered her the following four options: reassignment to the GS-6 Secretary position in Illinois; downgrade to the GS-5 RMA position in Beltsville; resignation; or retirement. The agency did not advise the appellant that she could refuse all four options, or what the consequences of such a refusal would be. Given that the agency repeatedly characterized its Work Reduction Procedures as a mechanism for avoiding a RIF, the appellant's refusal of the positions offered pursuant to those procedures might have resulted in the appellant's release from her competitive level pursuant to a RIF action. Conversely, the appellant might have been subjected to an adverse action removal for refusing a directed reassignment to the GS-6 Secretary position in Illinois. The agency likewise failed to advise the appellant of her Board appeal rights in the event of either such outcome.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to provide an employee with information that is not only correct in nature, but adequate in scope to allow the employee to make an informed decision. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Homeland</span> Security, 111 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 8 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 361 Fed. Appx. 134 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Where, as here, an employee decision is made with "blinders on," based on misinformation or a lack of information, such a decision is involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, we find that the appellant's "acceptance" of a downgrade to the GS-5 RMA position was involuntary. Moreover, as the administrative judge further noted, where the Board finds that an employee-initiated action is involuntary, it must be reversed by operation of law. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6; 46 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant's subsequent resignation was also involuntary. As previously set forth, the administrative judge found that the agency directed the appellant's reassignment to the GS-6 Secretary position in Illinois without a legitimate basis, noting that the Board has found that a resignation obtained through such an improper reassignment, even one which did not immediately precede the resignation, was itself rendered involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Caveney</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 670 n.2. Having instead concluded that the appellant's decision to accept a downgrade to the GS-5 RMA position was rendered involuntary based on the agency's failure to provide her with her full range of options, we find that her ultimate decision to resign from that position was likewise proximately influenced by this same lack of information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, the appellant's immediate supervisor, Leigh Nichols, acknowledged in hearing testimony that the appellant was "very unhappy" and "very upset" about the choices presented in the agency's August 7, 2007 letter. The appellant herself explained that she decided to resign after realizing that she had no hope of regaining her GS-6 grade and that consequently her long agency career had reached a dead-end.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mere fact that the appellant was faced with unpleasant choices, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that of staying in her downgraded position or resigning, does not, by itself, render her decision to resign involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-1137 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Had the appellant been afforded her full range of potential options, however, either at the time of her resignation or a year previously, when she accepted the downgrade, she may well have had entirely different choices to make. While it is not possible to reconstruct, after the fact, whether such alternate outcomes would have been more or less welcome than the ones she ultimately faced, the fact remains that her resignation, like her prior downgrade, was proximately influenced by the agency's failure to provide her with adequate information regarding the options effecting her employment future. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's resignation was involuntary, and must likewise be reversed as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee accepts a lower-graded job in the course of a RIF because of misleading information from agency officials about his assignment rights, the demotion is probably involuntary, but the Board will adjudicate the appeal as a challenge to the reduction in force. The remedy is for the agency to cancel the demotion and provide proper assignment rights. <span class="Italic">Swift v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 23 MSPR 210, 212 (1984). If a downgrading occurred because of improper information about a RIF, the appellant may make a claim of an involuntary downgrading. <span class="Italic">Greenfield v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3139), involved the voluntary downgrading of an employee who faced a potential RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1996, the Internal Revenue Service ("agency") was planning a reduction in force ("RIF") that could have had potential impact on Mr. Greenfield's GS-14 job. Indeed, on June 27, 1997, the agency gave Mr. Greenfield a Certificate of Expected Separation. Thus, the agency's planned RIF would have eliminated Mr. Greenfield's job. To avoid that unfavorable consequence, Mr. Greenfield accepted a lower grade (GS-13) position in September 1997. Many others in the agency who also might have been affected by the RIF-in-planning also opted for alternatives that avoided the risk of separation. Such alternatives included buyouts, early outs, and continuing positions at lower grades. In fact, enough employees took advantage of such alternatives that it became unnecessary for the agency to institute a RIF. Voluntary actions taken by agency employees sufficiently reduced the agency workforce that a formal RIF was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Greenfield appealed to the Board, arguing that his placement in the GS-13 position was an involuntary demotion. He argued that the agency's proposed RIF, which never materialized, was a ruse to get him to take a downgraded position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A hearing was held to adjudicate Mr. Greenfield's contentions. The Administrative Judge found, as a matter of fact, that the agency was engaged in good faith planning for the RIF when Mr. Greenfield, in his words, "blinked." That is, Mr. Greenfield was unwilling to take the risk that the RIF might not occur, or, that if it did, his job might not be adversely affected. Instead, he voluntarily opted for the safe course, namely, installation in the GS-13 position. The Administrative Judge rejected Mr. Greenfield's allegation that he had been coerced into taking the lesser position by misinformation (i.e., that the agency knew it would not effect the RIF). Citing well settled Board precedent, the Administrative Judge held that Mr. Greenfield volunteered for the GS-13 job, and could not complain that he is the victim of an involuntary demotion. Given the fact (as found) that his "demotion" was voluntary, the Administrative Judge dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction. A voluntary demotion is not an adverse action; the Board only has jurisdiction over adverse actions. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(1) and 752.401(b)(9); <span class="Italic">Torain v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 83 F.3d 1420, 1422-23 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Greenfield's appeal to the full Board was denied. Mr. Greenfield timely sought review of the Board's final decision in this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We have reviewed the record and the careful, well-articulated opinion of the Administrative Judge. Substantial evidence supports the fact-finding that Mr. Greenfield "blinked" voluntarily, opting for the safe course of the GS-13 position, and that at the time he so opted, the agency in good faith thought that a RIF would be necessary, adversely impacting Mr. Greenfield's old GS-14 position. Voluntary choice of the safe course does not, in the eye of the law, amount to an involuntary demotion. <span class="Italic">Torain</span>, 83 F.3d at 1422-23....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An involuntary downgrading claim did not meet Board jurisdictional standards when it was accepted in anticipation of a possible RIF, <span class="Italic">Broussard v. USPS</span>, AT-0351-15-0673-I-1 (NP 8/26/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as an EAS-21 Vehicle Maintenance Facility (VMF) Manager at the Columbia, South Carolina VMF. During the first week of May 2015, the agency announced that it would be restructuring its VMF organization and that a reduction in force (RIF) might be necessary. The appellant's position was one of the positions proposed to be eliminated. On May 22, 2015, the appellant requested a noncompetitive reassignment to the posted EAS-19 VMF Manager position at the Columbia, South Carolina VMF. Effective May 30, 2015, the agency processed the appellant's noncompetitive placement in the EAS-19 VMF Manager position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To constitute an appealable action, a reduction in grade or pay must be involuntary. <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Department of Transportation</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. <span id="Page_1924"></span>520, &#x00B6; 12 (2007). The Board will grant a hearing to determine whether an appellant involuntarily accepted a lower-graded position only if the appellant nonfrivolously alleges that his acceptance was the result of duress, coercion, or misrepresentation by the agency. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To meet the nonfrivolous standard, an appellant need only plead allegations of fact that, if proven, could show jurisdiction, though mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations are insufficient to satisfy the nonfrivolous standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, one way of overcoming the presumption of voluntariness is by showing that the appellant's acceptance of the lower-graded position was the product of coercion by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (discussing the standard in the context of an alleged involuntary resignation or retirement). To establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion, an employee must show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's acceptance of the lower-graded position, that the employee had no realistic alternative but to accept the lower-graded position, and that his acceptance was the result of improper acts by the agency. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. However, "the doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "[T]he fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, the test for involuntariness is an objective one, requiring that a reasonable employee in the same circumstances would have felt coerced into acting similarly. <span class="Italic">See generally Conforto v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 713 F.3d 1111, 1121 (Fed. Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that, due to the agency's "decision to severely limit the competitive area" and its "callous disregard" of Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidelines, he had "no reasonable choice other than to take a downgrade, or be released from service on the date specified in the agency's General RIF notice." He further argues that "being forced to 'compete' for a similar level position hundreds of miles out of state and at great personal expense...is also not a 'reasonable' option in accordance with OPM guidelines." As the administrative judge correctly determined, however, the appellant has failed to allege facts that, if proven, would establish that the agency acted improperly in setting the competitive area for the RIF. Furthermore, as stated above, a choice between unpleasant alternatives does not render an employee's choice any less involuntary. <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124; <span class="Italic">Soler-Minardo v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 9 (2002) (finding that the fact that the appellant was faced with either a demotion or a possible removal did not render her acceptance of the agency's proposal involuntary). Here, the fact that the appellant chose to accept the lower-graded position to avoid the potential impact of a RIF does not render his decision to accept the lower-graded position prior to the RIF period involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee also may rebut the presumption of voluntariness by showing that his acceptance of the lower-graded position resulted from reasonable reliance on the agency's misinformation. <span class="Italic">Herrin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 10 (2004). A reduction in grade will be considered involuntary if the employee materially relied on the agency's misinformation, to his detriment, based on an objective evaluation of the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted below that his decision to request a reassignment to a lower-graded position was based on erroneous or misleading information because a senior management official assured him that he would be promoted to a higher-graded position and that accepting the lower-graded position was merely a formality to allow him to stay on the agency rolls while the selections for the higher-graded positions were finalized. The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that his acceptance of the lower-graded position was involuntary due to misinformation because he did not allege that the agency ever informed him that his chances for receiving a promotion following the reorganization were contingent upon his acceptance of a lower-graded position or that he would be separated if he remained in his former position rather than accepting the lower-graded position. The administrative judge also found that, even if the appellant had remained in his former position and had been released from his competitive level during the RIF, he would have had reassignment rights that might have resulted in his being reassigned to a position that would have allowed him to remain on the agency's rolls to compete for the higher-graded positions. Additionally, the administrative judge noted that, by the appellant's own admission, the agency offered the appellant one of the higher-graded positions resulting from the reorganization, but he rejected the offer because he refused to relocate from South Carolina to Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the administrative judge erred in finding that his acceptance of the lower-graded position was not involuntary due to misinformation because the RIF timeline indicated that employees in his position would be released by a specific date if they did not find a new position by then, and because, as a retired military veteran, he was not entitled to RIF protections and had no reassignment rights. As the administrative judge noted, however, the appellant admitted that the agency offered him one of the EAS-25 positions, which he declined. Thus, even if, as the appellant alleged, the agency assured him that he would receive a promotion after he accepted the lower-graded position, he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency provided him incorrect information because the agency in fact offered him a promotion less than 2 months after he requested reassignment to the lower-graded position. Moreover, the appellant's contentions on review provide no basis to disturb the administrative judge's findings that the appellant has not nonfrivolously alleged that he reasonably relied on the agency's misinformation to his detriment. Even if his contentions on review are true--namely, that employees in his position would be released by a specific date if they did not find a new position by then and that he was not entitled to RIF protections or reassignment rights--he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that he is in a worse position than he would have been absent the agency's alleged misinformation regarding when he would receive a promotion. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's acceptance of the lower-graded position was not involuntary based on misinformation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's acceptance of a lower-graded position also may be considered involuntary if he did not have sufficient time to reflect about his alternative course of action before he was required to make his decision. <span class="Italic">Soler-Minardo</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 7. Unreasonable time constraints have been found to constitute coercion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant appears to argue that the agency imposed an unreasonable time constraint of 21 days on him to either accept a lower-graded position or to be separated from service. Even if the appellant's factual assertion is true, however, a 21-day period to consider his alternative course of action before he was required to make his decision is not an unreasonable time constraint. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soler-Minardo</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 10 (finding that a 10-day period to decide between accepting a demotion or facing possible removal was not an unreasonable time constraint).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant appears to argue on review that the administrative judge erred by failing to address his contention that the agency violated OPM's guidelines, which require Federal agencies to "make every effort to find similar leve[l] employment within commuting distance when Agency reorganizations are made." Contrary to the appellant's assertion, the administrative judge considered the appellant's argument to the extent it pertained to the dispositive jurisdictional issue, i.e., whether the agency acted improperly as to render his acceptance of the lower-graded position involuntary. As discussed above, the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that his acceptance of the lower-graded position was involuntary, and therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal. We find that, absent an appealable action, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's challenges to the agency's reorganization. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (explaining that the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Herrin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 95 MSPR 536, 539-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13 (2004), considered the individual whose employer, the Air Force, misrepresented the proper pay grade of her appointment as a term employee, GS-6, Step 6, following prior employment as a GS-7 with the Customs Service, and the further difficulty that ensued when the appellant applied for another term appointment at a GS-5 level within Air Force. Appellant was told that she would be paid at Step 10 of the pay rate, but her pay was then adjusted downward when it was discovered that her pay step at the initial appointment to the GS-6 position was incorrect and should have been at the Step 2 level. The appellant argued that her reduction in grade from GS-7 to GS-6, and her further reduction in grade from GS-6 to GS-5 were involuntary based on information as to pay rates that the Air Force agreed had erroneously been provided to her. The Board decided that it could do nothing about the claim to the GS-7 held with Customs Service because the Air Force appointment was at a GS-6 and the appellant's grade with Air Force could not be enhanced based on the argument that, but for the Air Force misrepresentations concerning her pay, the appellant would not have left her GS-7 Customs Service job. The Board decided to do nothing about the reduction from GS-6 to GS-5, because the appointment to the GS-6 position was a term appointment that expired by the time the pay-setting error was discovered. The Board would not improve upon the term appointment at the GS-6 level by extending it based on the incorrect information that led the appellant to take another term appointment at the GS-5 level. The complexities were considerable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 6, 1999, the appellant, who had been a GS-7, Step 1, employee with the U.S. Customs Service, received a term appointment (NTE 2 years) <span id="Page_1925"></span>to a GS-6 position with the Department of the Air Force. The agency set the appellant's pay rate at GS-6, Step 5. In February 2001, the appellant applied and was selected for another term appointment (NTE 4 years) with the agency in a GS-5 position. The agency initially informed the appellant that it would set her rate of pay at GS-5, Step 10, but in fact set the pay rate at GS-5, Step 8. After the appellant was serving in the GS-5 position for about 3 months, the agency informed her that her pay step at her initial appointment to the GS-6 position was incorrect, that it should have been at Step 2, not Step 5, and that the initial pay-setting error affected her current rate of pay, which was corrected to GS-5, Step 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for appeal, alleging that her reduction in grade from GS-7 to GS-6 and her reduction in grade from GS-6 to GS-5 were rendered involuntary based on the erroneous pay-step information provided by the Department of the Air Force. The appellant did not request a hearing. Based on the parties' submissions, the administrative judge found that agency personnel specialists provided the appellant with incorrect information about the correct step level when she assumed both the GS-6 and GS-5 positions. She found further, however, that no Board precedent exists to support a determination that a reduction in grade is rendered "involuntary based on misinformation from a different Federal agency than the employing agency." Thus, she concluded that the appellant failed to prove her claim of involuntary reduction in grade from the GS-7 position at Customs to the GS-6 position at the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's reduction in grade from GS-6 to GS-5, the administrative judge found that the appellant would not have accepted that reduction in grade and pay had she been told the correct salary level of the GS-5 position. She based this finding on a statement by the agency Inspector General to a Member of the House of Representatives that the agency had notified the appellant that her salary in the GS-5 position would be at the Step 10 level, and on a letter from the Director of Civilian Personnel Operations to the appellant stating that the appellant "accepted this position in good faith based on the information provided by my staff." Because the statements were not prepared in anticipation of litigation, the administrative judge accorded them greater weight than affidavits by agency employees stating that salary level may not have been discussed with the appellant prior to her accepting the GS-5 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, because the Department of the Air Force provided the appellant with misinformation regarding her reduction in grade from GS-6 to GS-5, the appellant proved that the reduction in grade was involuntary. The administrative judge therefore ordered the agency to cancel the appellant's change to lower grade from GS-6 to GS-5, and to reinstate her to the GS-6 position with back pay and interest. The administrative judge noted that, because the GS-6 position no longer existed, if the appellant preferred to remain in her GS-5 position, she could elect to do so. The administrative judge also ordered that, if a petition for review was filed by either party, the agency must provide interim relief to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has petitioned for review. The agency has responded in opposition to the petition. The agency also has submitted documents to show compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order, including documents showing that it cancelled the appellant's appointment to the GS-5 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board is without authority to place the appellant in a GS-7 position.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge should have ordered her placed in a GS-7 position. The Board has consistently held that the proper party respondent in an appeal where the issue is whether the appellant's action was involuntary based on misinformation is the agency that allegedly misinformed the appellant<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Baier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 210, 213 (1990). Here, the agency that allegedly misinformed the appellant was the Department of the Air Force. There is no assertion that the agency from which the appellant transferred, the U.S. Customs Service, provided misinformation. Thus, there is no basis on which the Board could find that the U.S. Customs Service was a proper party respondent in this appeal, in order to reach the conclusion that the appellant's reduction in grade from GS-7 to GS-6 was involuntary with regard to the U.S. Customs Service. <span class="Italic">Cf. Yaksich v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 355, 360 (1996) (an employee-initiated transfer between agencies is presumed to be voluntary unless the employee can show that the agency from which she transferred coerced her transfer).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Board lacks authority to order the Department of the Air Force to place the appellant into a GS-7 position. An appellant's entitlement upon the reversal of a personnel action is to be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante,</span> not to be placed in a better position than the one in which he or she would have been but for that action<span class="Italic">. See Silvestri v. Department of the Army,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 580, 584 (1994). The appellant never encumbered a GS-7 position with the Department of the Air Force. Thus, the Board does not have authority to order the Department of the Air Force to place the appellant in a better position with that agency than she would have been had she not relied on its misinformation. Even absent the pay misinformation, the appellant would not have encumbered a GS-7 position with the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, because the appellant was accepting an appointment at a different agency, the Board holds the appellant responsible for determining the consequences of the change of positions<span class="Italic">. See Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 535 (1998). Notwithstanding that the Department of the Air Force should have informed the appellant of the correct pay information and that it is possible that the appellant may not have taken the GS-6 term appointment if she had known of the correct pay information, the appellant was subject to the pay regulations applicable to the GS-6 position and such regulations cannot be waived<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Paszek v. Department of Defense</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 534, 538 (1991); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 48, 52 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not establish that the Department of the Air Force constructively demoted her from GS-6 to GS-5.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee initiated actions are presumed to be voluntary, and the Board does not have jurisdiction over voluntary actions<span class="Italic">. Wise v. Department of the Navy</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 95, 98 (1997).

This is true even though the agency, in providing the misinformation, did not intend to deceive or mislead the employee<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Burgess v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 469, 473 (1995),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 86 F.3d 1179 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).

Beverly v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 247 &#x00B6; 9 (2001); <span class="Italic">Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 373, 378 (1997); <span class="Italic">Lematta v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 18, 20 (1984). Thus, to show that a reduction in grade was involuntary based on misinformation, an appellant must establish three elements: (1) The agency provided misinformation; (2) the appellant materially relied on that misinformation; and (3) the appellant's reliance was to his detriment<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Wise</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 98.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency admits that it provided misinformation to the appellant. Further, the appellant has presented evidence that she materially relied on this misinformation. She provided affidavits from her sister and one of her friends stating that she would not have accepted the reduction in grade had she been properly informed that the reduction would cause her to lose a substantial amount of pay. The administrative judge ended her inquiry into the issue of involuntariness after considering whether the agency provided misinformation and whether the appellant relied on that information. In most cases, the inquiry into the issue of the involuntariness of a reduction in grade properly stops there because the employee's detriment is obvious and needs no discussion<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Paszek</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 538-39. Here, however, the appellant's detriment is not obvious, and the inquiry should not have stopped there. The unique circumstances of this case necessitate consideration of the detriment element of the burden of proving involuntariness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not had occasion to discuss the meaning of the phrase "to his detriment" in the test to establish involuntariness based on misinformation. In <span class="Italic">Paszek</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 534, the Board applied the test, including the component requiring that the employee show that he relied on the agency's misinformation to his detriment, but did not find it necessary to discuss the meaning of detriment<span class="Italic">. Paszek</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 538. In that case, the appellant accepted a reduction in grade from GS-11 to GS-9 based on the agency's representation that he would receive pay at the GS-9, Step 9 rate. Subsequently, the agency discovered that its representation was erroneous and corrected the appellant's pay to the GS-9, Step 7 rate. The appellant filed an appeal that the Board treated as both a reduction in grade appeal and an involuntary demotion appeal. The Board found that the agency action giving rise to appellant Paszek's complaint "was not the agreed-upon reduction in grade from the GS-11 to the GS-9 grade level, but, rather, the agency's subsequent correction of the administrative error it had made in setting the appellant's salary." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found the pay correction action established that the agency earlier provided misinformation that rendered the appellant's reduction in grade involuntary. The Board did not discuss how the action was to appellant Paszek's detriment. Such discussion was unnecessary, however, because it was apparent that, because he encumbered a permanent GS-11 position that continued to exist as of the date of the pay correction, he lost a considerable amount of pay based on the agency's misinformation, and thus the action can be inferred to have been to his detriment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's reduction in grade from GS-6 to GS-5 is materially different <span id="Page_1926"></span>from the reduction in grade in <span class="Italic">Paszek</span>. Most important, the appellant was not leaving a permanent position but a 2-year term appointment that began on June 6, 1999. Further, the agency acknowledged in writing its administrative pay-setting error on June 15, 2001. Thus, the agency action giving rise to the complaint occurred after the expiration of the appellant's 2-year appointment. As of June 15, 2001, the date of the agency action that gave rise to the appellant's complaint, she had an entitlement to no better position within the agency than the GS-5 position that she then encumbered. The back pay that the appellant could receive from the date that she began serving in the GS-5 position to the date that the term appointment to the GS-6 position would have expired is more than offset by the fact that the appellant had the likelihood of continuing to earn a GS-5 salary for a number of years after the correction of the pay-setting error. The Board finds that the appellant failed to show that, under the circumstances extant on the date of the agency action that gave rise to her complaint, her reliance on the agency's misinformation was to her detriment. Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to show that the Board has jurisdiction over her alleged constructive demotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An involuntary downgrading claim may arise if incorrect information from the employing agency causes an employee to take a demotion that effectively cancels a disability retirement application; the employing agency should then be joined as a party to the appeal from the disability retirement determination. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 570, 575-76 (1990) (question of whether the employing agency informed an employee, before the employee filed for disability retirement, that acceptance of a demotion would result in the withdrawal of the retirement application from the position held prior to demotion), <span class="Italic">overruled in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Alford v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 114, 117-18 &#x00B6; 8 (1998) (agency was invited to participate in a Board appeal from the denial of disability retirement as a permissive intervenor when the appellant desired retirement; the issue was whether, because the agency allegedly failed to advise the employee that acceptance of a lower-graded position would effectively withdraw his disability retirement application, the Board could direct OPM to approve the retirement); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Malan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 283, 292 (1992) (considering the appellant's contention that he accepted a demotion based on statements by the agency that if he did not accept the position his disability retirement application might be denied).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because the Board determines its jurisdiction based on nonfrivolous allegations of involuntariness, including duress or deceit objectively measured, it is not an adverse action if an employee is fully informed of and accepts the conditions of a downgrade. <span class="Italic">Connors v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 422, 424-25, 4 MSPB 475 (1980). A downgrading and reassignment within an agency is not involuntary if the appellant hoped for, but did not receive, a promotion because of a misunderstanding, not caused by the agency, concerning the promotion potential of the job received through reassignment. <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 490, 492 (1982). In <span class="Italic">Lovings v. Dept. of Army</span>, 28 MSPR 5, 6 (1984), the appellant contended that she was informed she could accept a demotion and still appeal. The Board declined to find involuntary a downgrading accepted after the appellant's second-level supervisor "advise[d] appellant to take the demotion and fight it[;] he also, on two or three occasions told appellant to seek advice, before doing anything, from officials in the personnel office and from her attorney, because he...was not an expert in these matters. Appellant failed to heed that advice."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A downgrading can include a loss of pay retention benefits. <span class="Italic">Wise v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 95, 98 (1997), directed a jurisdictional hearing in an appeal resulting from the termination of retained pay that the appellant claimed on a permanent basis through a settlement agreement resolving a disputed performance appraisal. The jurisdictional issue was whether the appellant was either misled or inadequately informed by the agency concerning duration of the pay retention benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee-initiated action is presumed to be voluntary, and the Board does not have jurisdiction over voluntary actions. However, an employee may rebut this presumption and establish that a reduction in grade or pay effected pursuant to his request was in fact an adverse action by presenting sufficient evidence that the action resulted from his reasonable reliance on the agency's misleading statements or from the agency's failure to provide him with adequate information on which to make his choice. This is true even though the agency, in providing the misleading information or in failing to provide adequate information, did not intend to deceive or mislead the employee<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Burgess v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 469, 473 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 86 F.3d 1179 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). To make a nonfrivolous allegation entitling him to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue, the appellant need only set forth assertions of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the action was involuntary and thus within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hendricks</span>, 69 MSPR at 170.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for appeal, the appellant asserted that he was assured by the agency that by signing the December 6, 1994 Memorandum of Agreement, his pay retention would continue for as long as he was in the federal civil service. With his petition and in response to the administrative judge's show-cause order, he submitted a copy of the December 6, 1994 Memorandum of Agreement, which states, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The appellant] will exercise his return rights to a GS-12 position, and will be eligible for pay retention as a result of having held a higher grade level position for more than one year in accordance with Secretary of Defense's Memorandum of 13 February 1987. [The appellant's] pay retention will continue in accordance with FPM [Federal Personnel Manual] 536-25, Subchapter 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's statements and supporting submissions are sufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that his demotion was involuntary because the agency misrepresented that he would receive retained pay....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pay retention information was the source of a remand in Adams v. DOD, DC-0752-16-0670-I-1 (NP 7/21/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this appeal present another jurisdictional issue regarding whether the appellant has been subjected to an involuntary reassignment that resulted in a reduction in pay or grade. Although the Board generally does not have jurisdiction over reassignments, the Board has jurisdiction over agency actions that result in a reduction in pay or grade. <span class="italic">See McAlexander v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); see also 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3)-(4). A reduction in pay or grade that an employee accepts voluntarily is not within the Board's jurisdiction. McAlexander, 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 8; see 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(9). However, the Board has long recognized that employee-initiated actions that appear voluntary on their face are not always so. <span class="italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 7 (2013); <span class="italic">Spiegel v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 140, 142 (1980). For example, the Board has held that "[a]n employee-initiated action is considered involuntary if it resulted from the employee's reasonable reliance on the agency's misleading statements, or from the agency's failure to provide the employee with adequate information on which to make an informed choice." <span class="italic">Pawlowski v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 10 (2004) (<span class="italic">quoting Smitka v.

Department of Transportation</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 15 (2007) (finding that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that her reassignment and resulting reduction in pay were involuntary when she asserted that she relied on the agency's misinformation regarding pay when deciding to accept the reassignment); <span class="italic">Wright v. Department of Transportation</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 10 (2005) (finding that the appellant's assertion that he accepted a position based on the agency's misinformation regarding the nature of the reassignment and its effect on his base pay constituted a nonfrivolous allegation that his reduction in pay was involuntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has argued throughout her appeal that her reassignment to the Physical Security Specialist position was involuntary based on her reliance on the agency's misinformation concerning her entitlement to retained pay in that position. The record shows that the agency informed the appellant in the offer letter that she would receive the same salary that she had been receiving in her Police Officer position.[4] Moreover, the appellant stated in her sworn declaration that she relied on the agency's misrepresentation that she would receive retained pay in the Physical Security Specialist position when she accepted the new position. We find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that her acceptance of the reassignment to the Physical Security Specialist position was involuntary, thereby entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The agency initially offered the appellant the Physical Security Specialist position at an annual salary of &#x0024;57,713.00, which was her salary in the Police Officer position. The appellant requested that her reassignment be delayed for a brief period until after she received a periodic step increase, and the agency agreed. After she received the step increase, her annual salary in the Police Officer position increased to $60,277.00. She then was reassigned to the Physical Security Specialist position at the higher salary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an agency should not provide misleading information, or, alternatively, the agency should provide information that allows an employee to make an informed choice, a downgrading will not be set aside when the agency provided information that was correct at the time but later proved wrong, <span class="Italic">Burgess v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 469, 473-74 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee-initiated action is presumed to be voluntary, and the Board does not have jurisdiction over voluntary actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roche v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 141, 148 (1995). An employee may rebut the presumption of voluntariness and establish that a reduction in grade or pay effected pursuant to his or her request was in fact an adverse action under subchapter II of chapter 75, title 5, U.S. Code, by presenting sufficient evidence that the action resulted from the employee's reasonable reliance on the agency's misleading statements or from its failure to provide him or her with adequate information on which to make an informed choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). This is true even though the agency, in providing the misleading information or in failing to provide adequate information, did not intend to deceive or mislead the employee. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1927"></span>In support of their assertion of misinformation, the appellants submitted an August 31, 1993, Memorandum entitled "Unplaced Employees," in which the agency stated that it would "maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>" until the Board issued a "final decision" in <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 58 MSPR 345 (1993), in light of the Office of Personnel Management's "involvement" in that case. The Memorandum states that at least until the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> appeal was resolved, "[d]irected assignments outside the local commute are not authorized," displaced employees should be given the option of entering into training assignments, and the agency "cannot predict when [it] will approve directed reassignments outside the local commute area."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board held in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that assignments directed and effected by the agency during the restructuring may be covered by RIF regulations, and although the agency evidently had no intention of applying those regulations in connection with any reassignments outside the appellants' commuting area, the appellants waived their right to a hearing and submitted no evidence showing that when the agency effected their assignments to craft positions on June 30, 1993, it knew or should have known that RIF regulations had to be applied to the actions at issue in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>. <span class="Italic">See Smitka v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 680, 687 (1995). Thus, the appellants have not shown that the agency knew or should have known that it would suspend directed reassignments outside of local commuting areas in light of the Board's July 21, 1993, decision in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>. The appellants therefore have failed to establish that their requests for, and acceptance of, local assignments to craft positions resulted from their reliance on any misleading statements by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Roche,</span> 67 MSPR at 150-51; <span class="Italic">Smitka</span>, 66 MSPR at 687-89.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ginsiorsky v.

<p class="Body-Text">For misrepresentation of appeal or employment rights to make a downgrading involuntary, there must be reliance on the misrepresentations. Reliance on other factors diminishes the likelihood that the Board will find agency misrepresentation to be a causal factor in the action appealed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ryals v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 409, 412 (1983). A demotion is not likely to be viewed as involuntary if it is undertaken by the appellant after he has discussed with a personnel specialist options that include retirement and demotion to a position with duties consistent with his medical condition. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-780). <span class="Italic">Malan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 283, 291-92 (1992), addressed detrimental reliance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's action need not be coerced to be involuntary. It is also involuntary if obtained by agency misinformation or deception.... When it offered the Supply Clerk position to the appellant, the agency gave him the following advice about the effect of his acceptance or declination on his application for disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In considering this action, you need to be fully aware of the options available to you in terms of disability retirement. Acceptance of this position may void your eligibility for disability retirement based on your current medical condition as it disqualifies you for your current position of Aircraft Engineer Repairer, WG-8602-09, MANPWE. But you should also know that a refusal to accept a reasonable job offer may result in the Office of Personnel Management denying a request for disability retirement. Before you decline this job offer we recommend you consult with your servicing specialist in the Employee Entitlement and Benefits Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency did not tell the appellant that his disability retirement application definitely would be denied if he declined the Supply Clerk position, it did clearly warn him that such a result was possible. This advice was erroneous. The agency should have advised the appellant that he was free to decline an offer of a position at a lower grade or pay level without affecting his eligibility for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, 29 MSPR at 600; FPM Supp. 831-1, Subch. S10-4(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish that his acceptance of the Supply Clerk position was involuntary, the appellant had to show not only that the agency's statements were misleading, but also that he reasonably relied on these statements to his detriment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1574-75. In accepting the Supply Clerk position, the appellant added a handwritten notation, stating that "I do this In-Voluntarily. ? on Physical part of job." The agency contends that the sole reason the appellant made this notation was that he questioned whether he was physically capable of performing the duties of Supply Clerk. Both the notation and the appellant's written submission to the Board regarding jurisdiction confirm that he questioned his ability to perform the duties of Supply Clerk. He further stated, however, that he accepted the position because of his belief, based on the agency's statements, that his refusal to accept the Supply Clerk position might result in the denial of his disability retirement application. We find the appellant's explanation to be a reasonable one, which the Air Force failed to rebut. We therefore conclude that the appellant reasonably relied on the agency's erroneous advice in accepting the Supply Clerk position, that his acceptance was involuntary, and that the Air Force effected a reduction in pay within the Board's jurisdiction when it placed the appellant in the Supply Clerk position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appealable action against a nonprobationary Federal employee has not been effected in accordance with the minimum procedures that satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process of law, i.e., notice of the agency's charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond, the action must be reversed because it cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 680, 684 (1991)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Malan</span>, Chairman Levinson dissented, arguing that the written instructions of the agency were confusing and, being confused, the appellant should have sought further advice from entitlements specialists, 55 MSPR at 303-04:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's written offer of the Supply Clerk position cautioned that his decision would affect his eligibility for disability retirement. Acceptance of the Supply Clerk position, the offer warned, "may" void his eligibility for disability retirement. On the other hand, the offer also stated that refusal to accept a reasonable job offer "may" result in the denial of his disability retirement application. In language couched not in certainties or in probabilities, but in possibilities, the agency offer did not purport to advise the appellant on the decision to make. To the contrary, the only advice it offered the appellant was a recommendation to consult with his servicing specialist in the Employee Entitlements and Benefits Office. Given the agency's warning that either a decision to accept or to refuse the position offered might jeopardize the appellant's eligibility for a disability annuity, I believe a reasonable person would have followed the agency's recommendation and contacted an expert in the Employee Entitlements and Benefits Office. The appellant's choice to rely on his own interpretation cannot thereby convert the agency's warning and recommendation to seek expert advice to misinformation rendering involuntary his decision to accept the Supply Clerk position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An incorrect statement of appeal rights from an agency does not vitiate the voluntariness of a demotion if the employee does not rely on the incorrect advice when he accepts the downgrade, <span class="Italic">Ovens v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3429):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ovens also argues that he detrimentally relied on an erroneous statement in the May 16, 1996 letter which informed him that he had the right to appeal the Department's action to the Board. Understanding that the Department does not have the authority to confer appeal rights not specifically granted by statute or regulation, the AJ granted Mr. Ovens a hearing to demonstrate that his acceptance of the GS-13 position had been induced by the Department's misrepresentation. The AJ found that Mr. Ovens specifically rejected the assertion that he had been so induced. In his brief to this court, Mr. Ovens points out that at the time he received the May 16, 1996 letter, he did not specifically rely on the "right to appeal" statement in deciding whether or not to accept the GS-13 position in the CPOC. Rather, Mr. Ovens states that he considered the statement to be an accurate statement of the law based upon his belief that his demotion had been involuntary. We also note that Mr. Ovens was employed as a civilian personnel officer, a position that would presumably give him significant experience with RIF procedures and appeal rights. While we applaud Mr. Ovens' honesty and candor, it is clear that in making his decision to accept the GS-13 position in the CPOC, he was influenced only by his belief that his decision to accept this position was involuntary and not upon any misinformation about appeal rights contained in the May 16, 1996 letter.</p>
