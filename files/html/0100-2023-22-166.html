<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-164"><span class="space">l.</span> Clerical, Secretarial Work</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In these days of word processing, attorneys often perform tasks that are secretarial. Lawyers draft pleadings or briefs on word processors. They file significant papers at court, or perhaps with the Board, electronically. We add that AJs have been seen at their word processing stations pecking out decisions or orders. Should an attorney be paid less per hour because he performs "secretarial" tasks? Although not providing comprehensive guidance, under <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 33 MSPR 237, 242 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that Mr. Chapman should be compensated at his regular hourly rate for the .6 hours that the administrative judge attributed to secretarial tasks. The administrative judge found that it was inappropriate for Mr. Chapman to charge his full hourly rate for mailing or personally delivering letters and therefore deducted .2 hours from the .5 hours claimed....&#8197;We find, however, that the entries for these dates do not clearly show that Mr. Chapman performed strictly secretarial tasks, but merely describe his work in terms that could apply to clerical functions. Indeed, as the administrative judge acknowledged in deducting only part of the claimed hours, some of the work described involved legal tasks. We conclude, therefore, that it is appropriate to compensate Mr. Chapman at his regular hourly rate for the total amount of time claimed on these days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, DC-0752-11-0884-A-1 (NP 2/10/2014), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dixon requests to be compensated at the attorney rate for performing clerical tasks, such as serving various documents and speaking with the administrative judge and the Board's technology department when he encountered difficulty with the e-filing system. Such clerical tasks are not compensable at the attorney rate, but it may be appropriate to apply the rate of "$90.00 per hour for legal assistance work," as specified in the fee agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19; <span class="Italic">see Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-21 (2000) (stating that clerical work is not normally to be compensated at legal rates and finding that the administrative judge appropriately awarded fees for the appellant's attorney's clerical services at the lower rate specified in the fee agreement for such work), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Shelton v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 177, &#x00B6; 10 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board winnowed out some clerical tasks, deemed worthy of no more than the rate specified in the retainer agreement for legal secretaries or paralegals, in <span class="Italic">Diehl v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 104, 111-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (2001), a decision distinguishing as billable at counsel's hourly rate some time spent on preparing billing summaries for purposes of settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4710"></span>The appellant argues that the AJ erred by disallowing $2,548.50 in fees for his attorney's time spent preparing fax cover sheets, certificates of service, envelopes, and cover notes, and confirming receipt of faxes. The appellant asserts that these are not clerical tasks, and that in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agricul</span>ture, 33 MSPR 237, 242 (1987), the Board approved attorney fees for similar tasks. In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 87 MSPR 331 &#x00B6; 20 (2000), we addressed a similar argument that some clerical tasks were compensable under <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, distinguishing <span class="Italic">Harris</span> on the basis that the disputed work was found compensable because it was "legal in nature." After considering the appellant's assertions on review, we find that the time his attorney spent preparing cover notes was "legal in nature," since, as he explains, it involved communication with the appellant "about matters relevant to the handling of the case" and "could have been put into a formal letter, which would have been much more time consuming and costly to prepare." Thus, that time is compensable at the attorney's customary hourly billing rate. We agree with the AJ, however, that all of the other tasks described above were clerical in nature, and were not compensable at the attorney's hourly rate. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 87 MSPR 331 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-21 (time spent preparing certificates of service, fax cover sheets, envelopes, and sending taxes was not recoverable at the attorney's hourly rate).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although Thomas did not involve a claim for fees covering time spent confirming the receipt of faxes, as the appellant here claims, because the appellant has not explained how such a task was "legal in nature," we find that it is clerical, and therefore not compensable at the attorney's customary hourly rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the AJ subtracted from the fee award all fees the appellant requested at his attorney's hourly rate for tasks she deemed clerical. However, the fee agreement entered into between the appellant and his attorney specifies not only the attorney's hourly rate, but also the hourly rate for work performed by Paralegals and Legal Secretaries. On remand the AJ should consider whether it is appropriate to award the appellant fees for the tasks deemed clerical work at one of these lower rates. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 87 MSPR 331 &#x00B6; 19 (AJ awarded fees for attorney's clerical services at the rate of $45 per hour, as specified in the fee agreement). In addition, because the billing entries that include preparation of cover notes also encompass other tasks, which we have found were clerical, the AJ must determine which portion of those entries is compensable at the attorney's hourly rate, and which, if any, are compensable at a lesser rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also deducted $468.00 from the fee award for 3 entries totaling 2.4 hours covering the attorney's time spent updating and editing billing invoices, finding that such work is "overhead," and should not be billed. The appellant's attorney explains that he spent that time preparing the invoices as part of an offer of settlement of the attorney fee matter, not to submit to his client, and he argues that the tasks were part of the litigation and are therefore compensable. We agree, and we instruct the AJ on remand to include the $468.00 in the final amount awarded. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Department of Labor</span>, 40 MSPR 71, 77 (1989) (time devoted to settlement discussions included in attorney fee award)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-94-0233-M-1 (NP 12/16/2016) ("Notwithstanding the appellant's argument that the time spent performing clerical tasks should be allowed because delegating those tasks to someone else would have taken longer than performing them himself and thus it was more 'cost effective' for him to perform them, because the work at issue was clerical, the time spent performing it is not awardable as attorney fees."); <span class="Italic">Ruble v. OPM</span>, 96 MSPR 44, 48 &#x00B6; 8 (2004) ("The evidence submitted by the appellant on review shows that the time spent by the attorney's legal assistant on 'New Client Admin.,' facsimile, and processing tasks was secretarial or clerical in nature, and was not 'necessary supplemental secretarial costs' that may be reimbursable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach is consistently inconsistent. In <span class="Italic">SSA v. Balaban</span>, 33 MSPR 309, 320 (1987), a case involving a fee petition worth at least $50,000, ground exceedingly fine:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The hours devoted to research, document, and transcript review were clearly a legitimate expenditure of time; we also find that the small amount of time devoted to such activities as organizing the file and providing instructions to support staff was also a legitimate expenditure, given the large and complex record in this case. However, the .4 hours claimed for the entry on September 2, 1982, which apparently includes time for photocopying, as well as for other work, is reduced to .2 hours on the ground that this activity could have been delegated to support staff.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 635, 645 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2000), remarked, as the Board sustained reduction of the hourly rate from $225 to $45 for clerical or secretarial tasks:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not met his burden to justify awarding fees at his usual rate for these services. The Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 33 MSPR 237, 242 (1987), cited by the appellant in support of his argument, does not support his claim. In <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, the Board found that the disputed work as described in billing documents was indistinguishable from the legal work claimed, and that some of the disputed work was in fact acknowledged in the initial decision in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> to be legal in nature<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. That is not the case here. The appellant's attorney describes the cover notes that he prepared in general terms only as one-page handwritten descriptions of the mailing contents, and states that such notes also "provided other information to the appellant regarding the handling of her case." That description references no particular note, none is supplied in the record, and nothing in that description describes any task identifiably "legal" in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's attorney also argues that he is being punished for electing not to employ additional clerical personnel in his practice. The reduction of his claimed fees is not a punishment for his practice management choices, but merely the application of the Board's accepted principle that clerical work is not normally to be compensated at legal rates<span class="Italic">. See Gensburg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 MSPR 198, 207 (2000); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 19 MSPR 206, 214-15 (1994). A naked claim that all the work performed was billable at attorney rates only because the attorney chose to perform the clerical tasks himself (without any showing of its legal nature) "does not raise a serious question as to the numerous specific findings of the administrative judge warranting review." <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 19 MSPR at 215.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 331, 341-42 &#x00B6; 21 (2000) (subsequent fee petition); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 299, 308 (1996) ("Contrary to the appellant's argument on review, the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in disallowing 1.2 hours of law clerk time claimed for photocopying and delivering documents to the deciding official, on the ground that these tasks were more like clerical services than legal services.; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Koerner v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 150, 153-54 (1992) (fees for services of a paralegal that appeared to be clerical in nature were not recoverable under 5 USC 7701(g)(1))."); <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 198, 207-08 &#x00B6; 14 (2000) (AJ properly reduced hours by subtracting the time spent performing clerical and paralegal tasks, "such as mailing, faxing, and billing, because counsel failed to establish the community billing practice for non-legal work"; fees were also reduced for insufficiently documented time, for time that was excessive for the tasks performed, for hours that duplicated the work of other counsel, for time on an unsuccessful enforcement petition, and for time conferring with the appellant's physician and criminal defense attorney on matters irrelevant to the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board threw in the towel in <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 45 MSPR 475, 482 (1990), observing that "in determining the hourly rate at which legally related work and nonlegal or routine administrative activities may be billed, the Board will look to the billing practice in the legal community concerned." The Board retrieved the towel in <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 415, 420-21 (1992), disallowing some time for paralegal employees who apparently performed some clerical work associated with the assembly of a fee petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Koerner v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 150, 153 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Smit v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 612, 623 (1994), involving the work of two attorneys, the Board deflected agency protests to some billings of appellant's counsel with the observation that "[t]he time logs do not indicate that the attorneys billed the appellant for time spent typing or duplicating or any other purely clerical work."</p>
