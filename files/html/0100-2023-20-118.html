<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-114"><span class="space">v.</span> Uniformed Service</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering an agency's motion to terminate a stay of a personnel action, the Board decided that a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service was not an employee as to whom corrective action could be obtained under the WPA. The Board rejected an argument that the officer was covered because he was supervised by employees, and the Board rejected a theory of joint liability, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Hardy v. DHHS</span>, 117 MSPR 174, 177-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-18, 2011 MSPB 96 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its initial request for a stay, OSC argued that the agency's issuance to Hardy of a Marginal performance evaluation was in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Under the WPA, an agency may not take or threaten to take certain personnel actions against an "employee" in a covered position (or an applicant for employment) because of a protected whistleblowing disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), (b)(8). The right to appeal to the Board alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) derives from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). <span class="Italic">Fishbein v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 11 (2006). Section 1221(a) provides a right to seek corrective action from the Board on behalf of "an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment" against whom a personnel action is taken, or proposed to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 11. As noted, OSC has statutory authority to seek a stay on behalf of such an individual. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), an individual must meet the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). <span class="Italic">Usharauli v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6; 16 (2011); <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14; <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 380, &#x00B6; 6 (1998). Unless otherwise clearly indicated, the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) applies for all purposes of Title 5. <span class="Italic">Simmons</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 380, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">see Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 696 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1), an "employee," in relevant part, is an officer and an individual who is appointed in the civil service by one of the types of individuals enumerated in the statute acting in their official capacity.[5] The "civil service" is defined as "all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1). The "uniformed services" is defined as the "armed forces, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(3). As a commissioned officer in the USPHSC at the time of the alleged retaliatory action, Hardy was a member of the uniformed services and thus explicitly excluded from the definition of "employee" in section 2105(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Among the types of individuals who may appoint an "employee" to the civil service are the President, a Member of Congress, a member of the uniformed service, and an individual who is an employee under the statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC argues that Hardy was an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105 in that he was engaged in the performance of a federal function under the supervision of federal officials while so engaged and was appointed by one of the types of federal officials identified in the statute acting in his official capacity. In so arguing, OSC ignores the language in the statute which requires that, to be an "employee," the individual must be "appointed in the civil service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1). As noted above, Hardy does not meet that requirement. Regardless of whether he meets the other requirements of the statute, his failure to be "appointed in the civil service" precludes him from being an "employee" entitled to protection under the WPA. Therefore the Board lacks jurisdiction over OSC's stay request on behalf of Hardy because he does not meet the statutory definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221 and 2302. <span class="Italic">See Verbeck v. United States</span>, 89 Fed. Cl. 47, 61 (Fed. Cl. 2009) (finding that, as an officer of the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, Verbeck was not covered by the WPA pertinent to civilian government employees).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;While we are not bound by decisions of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, we are persuaded by the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Verbeck</span>. <span class="Italic">See Mynard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 14 (2008) (decisions of courts other than the Federal Circuit, although not binding on the Board, may be followed if the Board finds the reasoning persuasive).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While not disputing that Hardy was a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service, OSC also argues that, until it investigates the circumstances of his employment, it cannot know the exact nature of his appointment at the time of the alleged retaliatory action. Again, the civil service to which Hardy must have been appointed in order to be considered an "employee" for these purposes specifically excludes positions in the uniformed services, which is defined as specifically including the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1), (3). OSC urges that <span class="Italic">Verbeck</span> is distinguishable in that Verbeck was supervised by two other Public Health Service officers, whereas Hardy was supervised by civilian managers. In so arguing, OSC misreads <span class="Italic">Verbeck</span>. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims specifically held that, as an officer in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, Verbeck was a member of a uniformed service and was thus not eligible for the protections of the WPA. <span class="Italic">Verbeck</span>, 89 Fed. Cl. at 61. <span class="Italic">Verbeck</span> is not, as OSC suggests, distinguishable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other cases cited by OSC in support of its position do not require a contrary result. In <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span>, the Board found that nothing in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) expressly exempts special consultants appointed under that section from coverage under the WPA.[7] <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 10. Section 209(f) provides that such consultants may be appointed without regard to the civil service laws. The Board found however that a section 209(f) appointee could bring "an [individual right of action (IRA)] appeal based on his termination from employment if he <span class="Italic">otherwise meets the statutory requirements for doing so.</span>" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). The Board in <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span> was unable to determine whether the appellant met all the parts of the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) and remanded the appeal for that purpose. <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 14. In <span class="Italic">Usharauli</span>, the Board found that a research fellow appointed to the National Institutes of Health under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(g) is covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)<span id="Page_3850"></span>(8) as long as he meets the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). <span class="Italic">Usharauli</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 16-18. The Board further found, based on the record evidence, that Usharauli was "appointed in the civil service," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, &#x00B6; 17, and it remanded the case for a determination as to whether he was appointed by or subject to the supervision of an individual named under (a)(1) and was engaged in the performance of a federal function under authority of law or executive act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In neither <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span> nor <span class="Italic">Usharauli</span> did the Board find, as here, that the appellant was specifically excluded from the statutory definition of "employee" under U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The agency asserts that Hardy became a member of USPHSC under the authority of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209 and that, as a Commissioned Corps Officer, he was appointed into the Reserve Corps under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204(a)(2). Notwithstanding, he was not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(c) and that matter is dispositive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC further argues that, based on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona National Guard</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 182 (1991), the Board should find, by analogy, that Hardy is entitled to protected under the WPA. In <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, the Board held that a National Guard technician must be considered a civilian employee of the Department of the Army or Air Force, and thus an "employee of an agency in the executive branch" who has the same right as other civilian employees of the Army and Air Force to file an appeal concerning restoration following active duty military service. <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 183-87. The Board in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> did not, however, nor was it required to, address the requirement that, to be an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), the individual must be an "employee" as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). Thus, no basis exists on which to analogize the situation in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> to the one presented here.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In any event, the holding in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> is no longer applicable because subsequent legislation, specifically, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, has eliminated Board jurisdiction in such cases. 38 U.S.C. chapter 43; <span class="Italic">Melendez v. Puerto Rico National Guard</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 252, 254 n.1 (1996), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 152 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC also urges the Board to apply the "joint employer" doctrine to find that Hardy was an employee of the agency. Citing <span class="Italic">Service Employees International Union v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 647 F.3d 435, 442-43 (2d Cir. 2011), OSC contends that applying to this case the five factors set out by the court to determine whether an alleged employer is a joint employer establishes that the agency, not the USPHSC, acted as Hardy's primary employer. This case does not support OSC's position. It does not address the public sector but rather private companies, and the analysis does not apply to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). We also are not persuaded by OSC's argument that we should apply either of two similar common law of agency tests to determine whether a person is an "employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Spirides v. Reinhardt</span>, 613 F.2d 826 (D.C. Cir. 1979), the court considered whether an independent contractor for a government agency could also be considered an employee within the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. The court noted the definition of "employee" found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a), but found that that definition applied only to Title 5 so that "resort to the civil service definition is unwarranted," since the issue to be decided was whether the appellant "may in any respect be deemed an employee under Title VII as amended." <span class="Italic">Spirides</span>, 613 F.2d 826, 830-31; <span class="Italic">see Ma v. Shalala, Secretary, Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01962389-90, 1998 WL 295965 at *7-*8 (1998) (since no provision in Title VII provides specific guidance on the meaning of the term "employee," the common law of agency test will be applied to determine whether the appellants should be deemed to be "employees" under Title VII).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Browning-Ferris Industries of Pennsylvania, Inc.</span>, 691 F.2d 1117 (3d Cir. 1982), the court considered whether an individual could be considered an "employee" of two organizations at the same time. The court found that, in applying the "joint employer" standard to the facts of the case, the National Labor Relations Board correctly concluded that both employers were "joint employers" "within the meaning of the [National Labor Relations Act]." <span class="Italic">Browning-Ferris</span>, 691 F.2d 1117, 1124. None of these cases in the previous paragraphs provide support for OSC's position that Hardy is an "employee" of the agency. The National Labor Relations Board and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cases considered statutes that do not provide a specific definition of "employee," and so they resorted to common law doctrines. In contrast, the issue in the instant case is whether Hardy is an "employee" as clearly defined under Title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Borgo v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 29 (1994), wherein the Board granted OSC's stay extension request even though it had earlier dismissed Ms. Borgo's IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction, Hardy's attorney argues that jurisdictional questions do not bar a stay extension. We are not persuaded that <span class="Italic">Borgo</span> requires a finding in favor of OSC and Hardy. An administrative judge of the Board had dismissed Borgo's IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that she did not demonstrate that she engaged in whistleblowing activities. <span class="Italic">Borgo</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 30-31. We note that <span class="Italic">Borgo</span> was decided before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified jurisdictional and merits issues in IRA appeals. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the court held that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative remedies before OSC and makes nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) He engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. Under <span class="Italic">Yunus</span>, the administrative judge's finding in <span class="Italic">Borgo</span> was a merits finding, not a jurisdictional one. Regardless, <span class="Italic">Borgo</span> is distinguishable from the situation present here since Hardy is specifically excluded under the statute from protection under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Hardy's attorney argues that the question of whether Hardy is an "employee" entitled to protection under the WPA is a merits question and is not jurisdictional. In support, he cites to <span class="Italic">Arbaugh v. Y&#x0026;H Corp.</span>, 546 U.S. 500 (2006), and cases which followed it. In <span class="Italic">Arbaugh</span>, the Court held that the defendant's status as an "employer" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e was a question that went to the merits of the case as an essential element of the claim for relief, and not a jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">Arbaugh</span>, 546 U.S. at 500-01, 516. The Court examined Title VII's numerosity threshold and concluded, based on the language of 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1331 and 1332, the basic statutory grants of federal court subject-matter jurisdiction, and 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(3), Title VII's jurisdictional provision, that the threshold was not tied to subject-matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 513-15. The <span class="Italic">Arbaugh</span> Court was not, however, reviewing the definition of "employee" applicable to the WPA, which is a jurisdictional matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, our reviewing court has upheld decisions in which the Board dismissed for lack of jurisdiction IRA appeals filed by individuals who were found not to be "employees" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stoyanov v. Department of the Navy,</span> 474 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (agreeing that the Board did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate Stoyanov's allegations that the agency was taking, or proposing to take, actions against his brother in retaliation for Stoyanov's whistleblowing activities); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 361 F.3d 647, 651 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (agreeing that an employee serving in a nonappropriated fund instrumentality has no right to appeal to the Board for alleged violations of the WPA); <span class="Italic">Levering v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 259 Fed. Appx. 321, 323 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (agreeing that an employee of a local Farm Service Agency is not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105 and therefore could not bring an IRA appeal before the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA is remedial legislation, the provisions of which the Board construes liberally to embrace all cases fairly within its scope, so as to effectuate the purpose of the WPA. <span class="Italic">Fishbein</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 8. However, even a liberal construction of the provisions of the WPA cannot confer jurisdiction where, as here, the law precludes it. <span class="Italic">See Adkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 233, &#x00B6; 12 (2006) (where the language of a statute is clear, it controls, absent an express indication of an intent to the contrary), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 525 F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">see also Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board lacks jurisdiction over claims of reprisal for whistleblowing brought by individuals who, like Mr. Hardy, are in the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, we are compelled to TERMINATE the stay, effective immediately.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;OSC's request for an extension of the stay is denied. The agency has asked the Board to stay OSC's investigation and Hardy's attorney has asked the Board not to take such an action. By this decision, the Board terminates the stay of Hardy's performance evaluation. OSC, not the Board, is charged with investigating prohibited personnel practices. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214. We also note that the agency has requested an extension of time in which to respond to OSC's filings. That request is rendered moot by this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reaffirmed that commissioned officers of the Public Health Service do not have Board adverse action or Individual Right of Action appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Gjovik v. DHHS,</span> DE-1221-11-0136-W-1 (NP 9/1/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Due to his status as a commissioned officer of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service (PHS), the appellant was a member of a uniformed service and, as such, did not qualify as an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) as he was not "appointed in the civil service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2101, 2105(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board does not have jurisdiction over an appeal under those provisions if the appeal is filed by "[A]n employee whose agency or position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 <span id="Page_3851"></span>of title 5." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12). Officers of the Commissioned Corps of the PHS are appointed without regard to the civil service laws. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204(a)(2). Consequently, the appellant's position as a commissioned officer of the Commissioned Corps of the PHS removes him from the coverage of Chapter 75 of Title 5.</p>
