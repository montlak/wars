<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-36"><span id="Page_1630"></span><span class="space">2.</span> Board Treatment of PFR, Reopening Request</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulatory PFR process governs and leads to the production of most of the decisions considered in this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. One party or the other files a PFR from an initial decision and the game is afoot. Ordinarily a nonparty who does not have intervenor status lacks standing to file a PFR. <span class="Italic">Sundwall v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 435, 437 (1982) (Board declined to consider a PFR by the agency-employer that suggested the appellant's condition had improved so that he could work rather than be placed on a disability annuity as directed by the initial decision). <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 211, 212-13 (1994), determined that if an appellant wins on the sole issue before an AJ, the appellant lacks standing to file a PFR; the appellant's remedy for problems with reinstatement is an enforcement petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On occasion the Board reopens the appeal on its own motion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bradley v. DCA</span>, 3 MSPR 498, 500-01 (1980) (Board reopened a case on its own motion and remanded for the AJ to develop the record and analyze evidence pertaining to the constitutionally protected conduct of the appellant; the Board noted that the appellant was unduly restricted at the hearing in the development of evidence supporting his reprisal claim). Rarely, one Board member exercises the right under 5 USC 7701(e)(1)(B) to require the full Board to review an initial decision, even though the other Board members would deny a party's PFR for failure of the party's pleading to meet the regulatory requirements governing PFRs: "One member of the Board may grant a petition or otherwise direct that a decision be reviewed by the full Board. The preceding sentence shall not apply if, by law, a decision of an administrative law judge is required to be acted upon by the Board." The procedure to be followed if one member directs that a PFR be granted, likely resulting in a dissent or concurrence by the sole member granting the PFR, was addressed in a memorandum of January 6, 1994, from General Counsel Fischer to Board Member Amador.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may decide a PFR on one issue and discover another issue, e.g., timeliness of the appeal, that needs to be addressed. The appeal may then be remanded for development of evidence and argument on the issue identified by the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Yost v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 489, 492 (1991) (remanding for a timeliness determination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily the Board will decline to review a final decision through a second PFR. The later PFR is barred by the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">Aceto v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 159, 161 (1989). If separate but identical appeals are filed with the Board, and the Board receives a PFR of an initial decision involving one appeal while the other, earlier appeal is pending with a region, the Board will dismiss the PFR because of the pendency of the prior action, as long as an identity of issues exists and the controlling issues in the dismissed action will be determined in the other appeal. <span class="Italic">Kinler v. GSA</span>, 44 MSPR 262, 263 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board regulations do not provide for the filing of motions to clarify initial decisions. One seeks review of the initial decision through a PFR. <span class="Italic">Jeffress v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 678, 679 n.1 (1984). If either party is in doubt as to the scope of the remedy encompassed in the initial decision, the Board expects the parties to allow that decision to become final (assuming no other objections to it) and then to obtain a determination concerning the scope of the remedy through an enforcement petition filed with the regional office that issued the initial (now final) decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Samuel v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 561, 562-63 (1991). If the Board receives a PFR but no initial decision was issued because an AJ did not treat the appellant's submissions as a matter that ought to be closed out with an initial decision, the Board treats the PFR as a justiciable matter to reach the propriety of the AJ's treatment of the appellant's submissions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blanchard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 393, 394 (1982). [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-129.html#sec16-127">Enforcement</a>," for MSPB compliance and enforcement procedures.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The PFR process has been reviewed by the Board several times, principally with the intent of reducing the backlog of cases experienced by the Board during the first two or three years of its existence. Steps were taken by the Board following a Case Flow Management Study issued on October 13, 1983, to: screen PFRs at the point of their receipt, assign priorities to sensitive cases for expedited handling, classify cases to reduce multiple levels of review, use a short-form decision for nonprecedential decisions, enforce a 110-day standard as a guideline for processing PFRs, establish productivity standards for employees that measure their effectiveness in handling PFRs, and issue standard operating procedures governing the processing of PFRs. The basic conclusion of the MSPB study was that to achieve greater efficiency, there should be fewer layers of duplicative review of PFRs and that "about 80% of the cases could be either 'short-formed' (i.e., fast tracked), or otherwise expedited due to the petitioner's failure to meet timeliness, jurisdiction, or because the case falls under clear Board precedent." Use of short form decision was discontinued in 2010. Other elements of the PFR process survive. The two-tiered review system, involving initial adjudication by an AJ, and review on petition for review of the AJ's decision was recognized by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Haebe v. DOJ</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1299 n.25 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In good years, the Board keeps the average time for disposition of PFRs under 120 days. Some years have not been so kind to the parties, with the processing time at the end of 2013 close to 300 days, but reduced to four or five months in 2015. Starting in January 2017, the Board lost its quorum, restored in March of 2022, with a backlog or inventory of PFRs of about 3,500.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pronouncements and statements of good intentions have not always led to elimination of the Board's backlog. 5 USC 7701(i)(1) was enacted to serve as a carrot and stick to force the Board, on the pain of bureaucratic humiliation, to issue decisions within the lifespans of those they affect. The statute essentially calls on the Board to state when decisions will be decided and, if the Board does not meet its deadline, to "publicly announce the new date by which it intends to complete action on the appeal." The Board does publicly announce its list of late decisions. In its central office lobby, sitting on an end table, there is a small tray containing a group of typed sheets. If one finds the Board, its lobby, and the table, and if, perchance, one examines the sheets of paper, one discovers on closer inspection the names of cases long delayed and the dates of their expected decision, usually a few months hence. When the anticipated decision date arrives, it is likely that many of the cases will be on the next list.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One reason for delay in PFR adjudication is that the cases are first analyzed and written up by the Office of Appeals Counsel and then circulated from member to member. Consecutive processing of cases by three members is inefficient. In an effort to reduce the delay for cases of little complexity, the Board issued Order 1060.15 on January 29, 1993, entitled "Simultaneous Processing of Selected Cases." Board filings and decisions are now usually digital, or they are scanned, so that they can be digitally retrieved--meaning that members may concurrently review files, reducing the time files circulate among the members' offices. The Government in the Sunshine Act of 1976, 5 USC 552b, generally requires that meetings of federal agencies with multiple members be open to public observation. Case disposition would likely be quicker if the Board members and their staff members could gather together to consider PFRs. There are exceptions in that statute that might permit nonpublic meetings of Board members on PFRs, but the practice is that with the exception of rare meetings of the Board as a group to receive oral argument on a case, Board members deliberate on cases in the solitude of their offices, with informal views on cases possibly shared through an informal network of their legal advisors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">PFRs may rarely require exceptional treatment. The Board once employed an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> procedure purposefully to delay adjudication of PFRs, when the issue of enhancement of counsel fees was pending Supreme Court review. The Board adjudicated components of fee petitions that were not affected by the high court's action. Fee enhancement could then be raised through refiled petitions following action in the Supreme Court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crow v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 131, 133 (1987). The Board also used a procedure entitled "Expedited Processing of High Priority Petition for Review (PFR) Cases," explained in Order 1060.13 (December 12, 1989), permitting the Board to agree on three (just three, to keep the numbers manageable) high priority appeals that will receive expedited processing. The criteria for expediting process were (1) the decision on the appeal will impact on other pending cases; (2) a group of appeals share a common issue; and (3) an appeal warrants expedition for "practical purposes such as that the case is very complex (the age of a case is usually indicative of its inherent complexity)." More recently the Board selects and decides lead appeals on issues affecting a type of appeal, e.g., furloughs; other appeals are placed on hold pending disposition of the lead cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The percentage of PFRs granted has declined as Board precedent has developed. Fewer issues remain unresolved. Until 2010, when the Board started issuing nonprecedential final orders containing abbreviated case analyses, almost two-thirds of PFRs were resolved by short (page-length) final orders that summarily denied the petition, with the occasional footnote explaining the basis for the disposition of the case. The PFR process became very selective--so much so that significant issues were often not addressed by the Board. The short-form PFR process generated some criticism from members of the Board. A summary decision on a PFR that raises significant issues wastes the time of the parties who brief the case, forfeits the ability of the Board to develop civil service law, and imposes on reviewing courts the task of deciding issues raised in the original PFR. The Board's former Vice-Chairman offered a dissent and a comment in <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 35 MSPR 381, 384 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I believe that this case involves an extremely important issue; and that these parties, as well as future litigants, deserve a full and fair explanation of the reasoning underlying the Board's decision. The Board should not abdicate its responsibility to provide correction, guidance and instruction when its administrative judges make errors which impact upon the proper adjudication of a case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Short-form summary adjudications ceased in 2010. Every PFR is now closed out with a reasoned decision, either precedential or as a nonprecedential final order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most appellants will have the choice of taking their cases either to the Board through the PFR or to the Federal Circuit for judicial review. In some appeals the appellant may best omit the PFR entirely, allow the initial decision to become final through the lapse of time, and take the case into court. If an appellant has limited assets and a choice must be made, given issues worthy of review, the best route may be court: at least until the advent of widespread use of nonprecedential final orders in 2010, the Board dismissed too many PFRs raising valid issues without substantive discussion to engender confidence in the Board as a thorough reviewing tribunal. That is not to say that Board decisions never contain reasoned analysis of facts and law. And it is not to say <span id="Page_1631"></span>that the Federal Circuit always provides close analysis of issues raised in that court. Some Federal Circuit appeals, particularly those handled by counsel for appellants, are resolved through unarticulated summary affirmations of the results reached by the Board. If MSPB is distressed that it did not have the opportunity to address an issue because an appellant propelled an initial decision into court, the Board can request (and occasionally obtain) a remand from the court for consideration of the issue. For agencies, PFRs are the last resort unless intervention is sought by OPM through the reconsideration process. It makes good sense for an agency to use a PFR for a nonfrivolous issue; depending on OPM to preserve and litigate issues in court is an uncertain venture. [Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-101.html#sec17-97">Necessity for PFR to MSPB</a>," for judicial review procedures and the part the MSPB PFR plays in the administrative exhaustion scheme.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Almost all the emphasis in this section is on the PFR, the means the appellant or agency uses to obtain review of an initial decision. Not to be forgotten, however, and briefly discussed below, is the reopening authority the Board reserves to itself, 5 CFR 1201.118 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of any other provision of this part, the Board may at any time reopen any appeal in which it has issued a final order or in which an initial decision has become the Board's final decision by operation of law. The Board will exercise its discretion to reopen an appeal only in unusual or extraordinary circumstances and generally within a short period of time after the decision becomes final.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reopening authority, when exercised, provides the Board with a means of quality control to avoid gross errors by AJs that might escape the parties' attention or ability to litigate. The Board may use that authority to decide an issue not raised by the parties in a PFR. <span class="Italic">Stone v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 634, 637-38 (1988), a performance case involving the validity of performance standards, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has petitioned for reconsideration contending that the Board erred in considering and deciding on the validity of the appellant's performance standards because the appellant did not raise the issue in her petition for review of the initial decision or in her appeal to the Board. OPM is mistaken in its interpretation of the Board's responsibility in its review of initial decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's role in granting a petition for review is to evaluate an agency's personnel action. <span class="Italic">See McIntire v. Consumer Product</span> <span class="Italic">Safety Commission,</span> 19 MSPR 437 (1984); <span class="Italic">Payne v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Interior,</span> 26 MSPR 159 (1985). Even absent the filing of a petition for review, the Board, like other administrative agencies, has the inherent authority to reopen a case on its own motion.[4] 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117; <span class="Italic">Bookman v. United States,</span> 453 F.2d 1263, 1265, 197 Ct. Cl. 108 (1972); <span class="Italic">Rysavy v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 28 MSPR 263, 264 (1985). The Board, therefore, has the authority to open a decision, when no petition for review has been filed, to address an issue without the urging of the parties. Clearly, it is within the scope of this authority for the Board to address an issue not raised by the parties (before the initial decision becomes final.) Accordingly, the Board did not err in considering and deciding on the validity of the appellant's performance standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In order to reopen a decision on its own motion, the Board need only exercise the right within a reasonable time and give the parties proper notice. <span class="Italic">York v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 18 MSPR 505, 509-510 (1983), <span class="Italic">motion for enforcement</span> <span class="Italic">denied,</span> 18 MSPR 517 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may essentially forgive an untimely PFR by exercising its discretion under its authority to reopen the case. The reopening procedure can also be used in an objectionable manner. In theory, a case long dormant decided in favor of one party or another could be reopened to achieve an opposite result. In the <span class="Italic">Lynch</span> appeal [discussed in Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-058.html#sec12-55"><span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span> Case; Accommodation Requirements</a>"] the procedure was used to vitiate conclusions reached by EEOC through rewriting the facts determined by an AJ whose decision was directly appealed to EEOC, a result determined to be unacceptable by a reviewing district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987). [Procedures for reconsideration or reopening of an appeal are discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-12-065.html#sec5-65">Authority to Reopen and Reconsider</a>."]</p>
