<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-50"><span class="space">c.</span> Issue of Mental Incompetence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Swentek v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 605, 608-18 (1997), involved OPM's unjustified refusal to extend the period that a mentally incompetent former employee could apply for disability retirement. Because the appellant could not competently represent himself, <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> counsel was obtained who, following a favorable result, sought and was denied counsel fees. In order to provide additional protection for mentally disabled employees involved in disputes with OPM over retirement benefits, the Board placed on OPM a duty to more carefully investigate the circumstances of such retirement applicants or, failing a careful investigation before or during litigation, pay the fees of counsel who then had to litigate the issue that OPM should have more carefully reviewed. The essential determination is that fees are warranted to the prevailing appellant under the clearly without merit category "where OPM is aware of some evidence of mental incompetence and OPM failed to pursue the matter by undertaking prehearing discovery or otherwise making inquiry and did not actively contest the claim of mental incompetence at the Board hearing":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its June 7, 1994 reconsideration decision, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) dismissed as untimely filed under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b) the appellant's application for a Civil Service Retirement System disability retirement annuity. OPM acknowledged that, under the statute, the filing deadline may be waived for an employee who is mentally incompetent at the date of separation from service or within one year thereafter if the employee files an application within one year from the date of restoration to competence or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever occurs earlier. It found, however, that the evidence did not show that the appellant was incompetent during the one-year period following his separation from service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge twice dismissed without prejudice the appellant's petition for appeal of OPM's reconsideration decision, first to provide the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant with <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation because of the appellant's apparent inability to represent himself and second to allow the parties to consider the possibility of a deferred annuity for the appellant under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8338(a). The appellant, by his <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> counsel, timely refiled his petition for appeal after the second dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding a hearing, the administrative judge reversed OPM's reconsideration decision....&#8197;He found...that the filing deadline should be waived because the appellant was not functioning beyond a minimal capacity to manage his own affairs during the entire filing period....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To award fees under the "clearly without merit" category in disability retirement appeals, the Board considers the totality of the evidence, including: (1) Whether OPM misled the appellant or failed to put him on notice of the kind of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration; (2) the extent to which reversal was based on evidence the appellant did not present to OPM, but that was nevertheless readily available to OPM; and (3) the extent to which the appellant produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for an annuity and OPM's continued refusal to approve the annuity prolonged the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Regnier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 MSPR 229, 232 (1996); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 64 MSPR 6, 10 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the first new category proposed by the appellant, as modified by this Opinion and Order, should be considered under the second prong of the existing "clearly without merit" category. The new extension of the second prong is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where OPM is aware of some evidence of mental incompetence and OPM failed to pursue the matter by undertaking prehearing discovery or otherwise making inquiry and did not actively contest the claim of mental incompetence at the Board hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority for awarding attorney fees in disability retirement cases is set forth at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davis,</span> 64 MSPR at 9. That section provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4580"></span>[T]he Board...may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board...determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for statutory interpretation is the plain language of the statute in question. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Senior Executives</span> <span class="Italic">Association v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 67 MSPR 643, 650 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.</span>, 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980)), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 113 F.3d 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Board discussed the wording of this statutory provision. The Board found it apparent that the statutory examples of cases involving prohibited personnel practices or agency actions that were clearly without merit do not exhaust the circumstances in which an award of fees may be warranted. It found that "the statute plainly authorizes such awards in cases 'including'--but not limited to--those examples." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 428. The plain and unambiguous meaning of a statute prevails absent clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vesser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 F.3d 600, 605 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the language of the statute, the Board may examine the statements of members of Congress interpreting a statute. <span class="Italic">Senior Executives Association</span>, 67 MSPR at 651. In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Board found it necessary to examine the legislative history of the statutory provision for elucidation. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 428. The Board explained that the attorney fees award statutory provision evolved as a compromise after Congress considered the Carter Administration proposal, the House bill, and the Senate bill. The report accompanying the Senate bill stated that the circumstances justifying an attorney fees award should be left to the discretion of the Board to develop in light of its experience. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 429 (citing S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 61 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> House Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act</span> at 1525 (Comm. Print No. 96-2, 1979) (<span class="Italic">Legislative History</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The differences between the House and Senate bills were resolved in conference, producing section 7701(g)(1) as enacted. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 428-30. The Conference Committee offered only a brief comment on the final standard, noting that it authorized the award of attorney fees where the deciding official determined that fees were warranted in the interest of justice, including a case involving a prohibited personnel practice or where the agency's action was clearly without merit. It specifically noted that the reference to those two types of cases is "illustrative only and does not limit the official from awarding attorneys' fees in other kinds of cases." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 430 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 142 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> <span class="Italic">Legislative History</span> at 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Conference Committee did not precisely define the "interest of justice" standard, some explanation was provided by the earlier statements of Senator Mathias. In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Board found that Senator Mathias's statements were entitled to some weight because he originated the "warranted in the interest of justice" standard and was a member of the Conference Committee. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 430. In presenting his proposal at the Senate Committee mark-up session, Senator Mathias explained his belief that the Board needed more flexibility in awarding fees. He stated that his proposal would allow the Board discretion in determining whether fees were warranted in the interest of justice. Transcript of Senate Committee's Mark-up Session on S. 2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 122-25 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In establishing the categories set forth in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Board used Senator Mathias's interpretation of the warranted in the interest of justice standard. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 430-31, 434-35. Although we found his examples "highly pertinent to the proper exercise of the Board's discretion," we specifically noted that virtually all of the examples could be subsumed under the two statutory examples ultimately enacted, and that the Conference Committee emphasized that those examples were merely illustrative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 435 n.38. The Board therefore found that those examples should "serve primarily as directional markers toward 'the interest of justice'--a destination which, at best, can only be approximate. Divination of that elusive objective must, in the most rigorous but still fallible last analysis, rely upon an impartial and rational sense of fairness constrained by practicality." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 435.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, nothing in the wording of the statute or the legislative history of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) precludes the Board from reexamining its established attorney fees categories. Indeed, the legislative history indicates that Congress gave the Board primary responsibility for developing attorney fees policy and intended us to have the flexibility to determine whether fees are warranted in the interest of justice on the basis of the experience we develop in adjudicating cases. Such flexibility implies that it is appropriate for the Board to refine its established categories for attorney fees if our experience shows that it is warranted. <span class="Italic">See Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 435. Indeed, that is what the Board did in <span class="Italic">Kent v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 MSPR 361, 368-69 (1987), when we first considered how the existing "clearly without merit" category should be applied in disability retirement cases and established the three-prong test set forth earlier in this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the new extension set forth in this Opinion and Order expands OPM's responsibility in disability retirement cases involving mental incompetence. However, we find nothing to preclude the Board from imposing such a responsibility. In this regard, we note that our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has recognized that attorney fees may be awarded even in cases where the agency is not at fault. It is true that in <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the Federal Circuit commented that the attorney fees award provision is primarily aimed at "agency misconduct." However, the court also noted that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) has "a general goal of removing impediments to litigation of a meritorious claim" and suggested that extraordinary economic hardship could support a fees award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, the court noted that the Board has considerable discretion in determining when an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice and stated that it would accord the Board's determination great deference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1568. The court found that such a result is dictated by the permissive language of the statute and the subjectivity of the standard for the award of fees. Similarly, the court cited the legislative history of the attorney fees provision, which directs the Board to develop fee policy in light of its experience. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1569-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the court has recognized that not all of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories are aimed at agency misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the court discussed the "substantially innocent" <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category. It held that Congress did not intend that category to punish agency misconduct but to minimize the burden an unsubstantiated accusation places upon innocent employees. Indeed, it stated that, when dealing with this category, "the question of an agency's original fault need never arise." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1457. The court reiterated this holding in <span class="Italic">Massa v. Department of Defense</span>, 833 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Because the Federal Circuit has recognized that attorney fees may be imposed in certain situations even where there is no agency fault, imposing in disability retirement cases an extra obligation on OPM in dealing with a mentally incompetent appellant, even though OPM appropriately carried out its initial responsibilities and the appellant has the burden of proving incompetence, serves the remedial objective of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that several factors warrant establishing this new extension of the "clearly without merit" category to award attorney fees for mentally incompetent former employees pursuing disability retirement annuities. These include the costs incurred by those individuals, the government's responsibility to provide for its disabled former employees, and the risks borne by counsel who agree to represent them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the Board's task to interpret the words of a statute in light of the purpose Congress sought to serve. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Campbell</span>, 58 MSPR 170,180, <span class="Italic">stay denied</span>, 58 MSPR 455 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 27 F.3d 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The Board has found that the purpose of the attorney fees provision is to facilitate appellants' access to counsel by alleviating their burden of bearing legal expenses resulting from erroneous agency decisions. <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 MSPR 292, 295 (1987). Moreover, we have specifically noted that often this burden is a heavy one for disability retirement applicants who typically have very limited financial resources. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that it is an even heavier burden for disability retirement applicants who are also mentally incompetent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118, <span class="Italic">reh'g denied</span>, 823 F.2d 489 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the Federal Circuit specifically addressed the government's obligations concerning its mentally incompetent former employees. In <span class="Italic">French</span>, the mentally incompetent former federal employee had appealed the Board's decision sustaining OPM's dismissal of his disability retirement application as untimely filed. The court concluded that an abuse of discretion had occurred, vacated the Board's decision, and remanded the case for reconsideration. It noted that, in <span class="Italic">Marcee v. United States</span>, 197 Ct. Cl. 363, 455 F.2d 525, 526 (1972), the former U.S. Court of Claims considered the role the government should take in a disability claim involving an incompetent former employee. It quoted with approval the following language from <span class="Italic">Marcee:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It might be supposed that the Congress expected the CSC [Civil Service Commission] not to sit passively back and leave the incompetent former employee to prove her incompetence. It could have taken the initiative in looking into the matter so that the obvious desire of Congress should be respected, that former employees disabled in the course of honorable service should not be reduced to penury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">French</span>, 810 F.2d at 1119-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4581"></span>The court further stated: "A candid assessment of the position of an incompetent in our society is that he is disadvantaged, and lacks the ordinary powers of the citizen." <span class="Italic">French</span>, 810 F.2d at 1120. It noted that 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b) "reflects a concern of Congress that one disabled because of mental incompetence is not to lose the disability annuity because of failure to meet, in timely fashion, the preconditions as to procedure the sane and normal must satisfy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court thus found that OPM must take an "active role" in determining an incompetent's claim to waiver of the one-year limitation for filing a disability application. In doing so, it noted that <span class="Italic">Marcee</span>, in <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, suggested "the possibility of a nonadversary determination following an active investigation by the agency, rather than awaiting what the applicant submits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also charged the Board with developing procedures to insure the presence of a competent conservator or attorney, if possible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and its predecessor, the Court of Claims, are binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Mills</span>, 73 MSPR 463, 469-70 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 97-3131, 1997 WL 586961 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 11, 1997) (Table). Consistent with the view of governmental responsibility expressed in <span class="Italic">French</span>, we find it appropriate to impose a duty of inquiry on OPM where the appellant requesting a disability retirement raises a claim of mental incompetence supported by some evidence. The government has an interest in ensuring that mentally ill former employees obtain the benefits to which they are entitled and do not slip into penury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand from the <span class="Italic">French</span> court, the Board recognized that the best way to ensure that mentally ill former employees obtain the disability retirement benefits to which they are entitled is to encourage attorneys to represent them. It thus directed its regional office to make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for the appellant. <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 MSPR 496, 499 (1988) (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attorneys, however, may be reluctant to accept such cases without the possibility of receiving any fees under statutory fee-shifting provisions. In addition to not being reimbursed for their work on the cases, they incur other, less obvious expenses. These include losing money they could be making from paying clients while working for the <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> clients, not being reimbursed for "out of pocket" expenses, and not being compensated for overhead expenses such as rent and malpractice insurance. Moreover, attorneys accepting <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> cases involving mentally incompetent clients may confront additional obstacles. These include the greater possibility that the clients not only will be unable to assist the attorneys in presenting their cases, but may actively hamper their attorneys' efforts by being uncooperative and suspicious. Thus, the additional risk borne by counsel agreeing to represent mentally incompetent former employees in these cases is a factor we find worthy of consideration in establishing this new extension of the clearly without merit category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that fees are warranted in the interest of justice in this case under the new extension of the second prong of the "clearly without merit" category: To restate, that extension is as follows: Where OPM is aware of some evidence of mental incompetence and OPM failed to pursue the matter by undertaking prehearing discovery or otherwise making inquiry and did not actively contest the claim of mental incompetence at the Board hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here there was some evidence of the appellant's mental incompetency before OPM when it issued its June 7, 1994 reconsideration decision. In a January 24, 1994 evaluation submitted to OPM, Neurologist Richard N. Edelson, M.D., reported that the appellant "had difficulty explaining his problem and articulating the exact reason as to why he was coming in. He had many papers with him, but appeared to be somewhat disorganized." In a May 1, 1994 letter to OPM, the appellant stated that "[t]he past has been a very confusing, disorganized time for me...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in a May 20, 1994 notarized statement submitted to OPM, the appellant's wife specifically described the appellant's inability to attend to his personal affairs, resulting in his untimely filing of his disability retirement application. She stated that she had "observed a steady decline in [the appellant's] ability to handle his personal matters," which had "manifested itself in a variety of ways." She noted that the appellant had lost numerous sets of house keys, misplaced numerous letters to be mailed, and lost his prescriptions and his money. She stated that the appellant then would spend an "unbelievable" amount of time trying to locate the lost items. She also noted that the appellant frequently misdialed telephone numbers, transposed the numbers, and had difficulty writing down and relaying messages. She stated that he also had difficulty locating his paperwork regarding bills and other obligations, including his government insurance policies, and that his paperwork was "a disorderly muddle." She stated that he had severe bouts of depression because it was difficult for him to cope with his affairs. She concluded that the appellant had "more or less lost track of his life."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after OPM issued its reconsideration decision, the appellant submitted additional documents to OPM evidencing mental incompetence. In a June 12, 1994 letter to OPM, Psychiatrist Andrew J. Chmiel, M.D., indicated that he initially saw the appellant in March 1986 for a "severe major depressive episode." He stated that the appellant manifested "symptoms of withdrawal, anxiety or agitation, poor appetite, sleep disruption, distractibility and poor concentration," and had difficulty making decisions. He stated that the appellant was "not mentally competent to fully handle his affairs at that time." In a July 14, 1994 letter, William J. Mroczek, M.D., stated that he saw the appellant three times during 1986. He indicated that it was possible that the appellant had impaired reasoning during this period of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, before it issued its reconsideration decision and shortly thereafter, OPM was aware of some evidence that the appellant was mentally incompetent. The record does not show, however, that OPM made any nonadversary determination of the appellant's competence during the period in issue or undertook any prehearing discovery or otherwise made inquiry in this subsequent appeal of OPM's reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See French</span>, 810 F.2d at 1119-20; <span class="Italic">French</span>, 37 MSPR at 498-99. Moreover, although OPM's representative appeared at the hearing and cross-examined the appellant and Dr. Chmiel, the hearing tapes do not indicate that she actively contested the appellant's mental incompetence during the relevant time period. Rather, in her closing argument, OPM's representative simply reiterated that the appellant bore the burden of proof, apparently indicated her belief that objective evidence was lacking, and asked the administrative judge to affirm OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that the administrative judge's seeking of <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> counsel under <span class="Italic">French</span>, 37 MSPR 496, was a factor that placed OPM on notice of the need for further inquiry into the appellant's mental competence. In his August 30, 1994 status teleconference summary, the administrative judge related the then <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's assertion that he was mentally incompetent during the relevant period after his separation and that he was currently mentally incompetent. He noted that the appellant had submitted the letters from Drs. Mroczek and Chmiel and the letter from his wife. He stated that, based on these documents and the difficulty the appellant experienced focusing on the issues during the teleconference, "I am convinced appellant is not mentally competent to represent himself in this matter." He proposed dismissing the appellant's appeal without prejudice in order to seek <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for the appellant. The appellant agreed. Although OPM objected to the dismissal, it cited no evidence that was not in the file to support its objection. Indeed, it admitted that the appellant had exhibited "obvious confusion and longwindedness during telephone conferences."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record is undisputed that the administrative judge subsequently dismissed the appellant's appeal without prejudice and sought <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> counsel for the appellant. Moreover, as, previously noted, the Board denied OPM's petition for review of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Swentek v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-831E-94-0584-I-1, 66 MSPR 281 (Dec. 21, 1994). Thus, the record does not show that the administrative judge's decision was incorrect. <span class="Italic">See also Eddy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 MSPR 442, 444 (1988) (finding that remand for application of the <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures was appropriate where there was evidence "tending to show that the appellant is mentally disabled").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that attorney fees are warranted in this case under the new extension of the second prong of the "clearly without merit" category.</p>
