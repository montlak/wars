<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-148"><span class="space">c.</span> Enhancement for Quality Work</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Following the 1992 decision in <span class="Italic">City of Burlington</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> it seemed, at least until the 2010 Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Perdue v. Kenny A.</span>, <span class="Italic">post,</span> unlikely <span id="Page_4688"></span>that the Board could enhance a fee award based on its standard market-rate formulation. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. DOJ</span>, 12 MSPR 436, 444, 11 MSPB 78 (1982), decided that a quality increase permits the AJ to recognize and reward achievements of a particularly resourceful attorney who secures a substantial benefit for his clients with a minimum of time invested. A quality adjustment was denied after counsel spent 176 hours on the posthearing brief, requesting two extensions of time for its filing, amounting to more than an investment of minimal time. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. DOJ</span>, 12 MSPR 436, 444, 11 MSPB 78 (1982). <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> was vacated as a result of a settlement agreement. The Board did not explain why it vacated its opinion or what the impact of its action was on the decision as precedent. Enhancement was summarily denied in another appeal because, "while counsel in the instant case did succeed in getting appellant restored to duty, and while he did so in an entirely satisfactory way, he has not demonstrated that the quality of his professional performance was so outstanding, taking into account the level of skill normally expected, to warrant an increase in the award of attorney fees on these bases." <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 28 MSPR 176, 182 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Vandiver v. GAO</span>, 7 MSPR 589, 591, 7 MSPB 429 (1981)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee enhancement was denied in <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 24 MSPR 627, 635 (1984). The hourly rate of $110 awarded reflected the skill of counsel and that the results were not achieved with a minimum of time invested; there was no substantial risk in undertaking the case because counsel knew from their investigation of the case that the termination action could not be successful. Of the quality aspect of the enhancement claim, the Federal Circuit ruled in <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. MSPB</span>, 781 F.2d 191 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that counsel exhibited special skill and experience; however, we do not agree that the success obtained was exceptional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court addressed the quality of representation factor in reviewing a district court's fee award enhanced on that basis. Agreeing that the quality of representation in that case was high, the Court went on to state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The "quality of representation," however, generally is reflected in the reasonable hourly rate. It, therefore, may justify an upward adjustment only in the rare case where the fee applicant offers specific evidence to show that the quality of service rendered was superior to that one reasonably should expect in light of the hourly rates charged and that the success was "exceptional."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this standard, we conclude that an adjustment is not warranted. It appears from the record that Gaswirth personally knew most of the senior management officials of the agency, which enabled him to avoid expending time familiarizing himself with the agency and its personnel, and performing formal depositions (with the associated travel time and costs) and other discovery. However, it also appears that the Board accounted for this special skill and experience in determining the reasonable rate. The Board observed that "[a]lthough counsel did an extremely thorough job of representing appellant, his skill level is reflected in his hourly rates."...&#8197;This is consistent with <span class="Italic">Blum</span> and is not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. FAA</span>, 32 MSPR 643, 649 (1987), denied a quality enhancement for counsel who were successful in changing the law governing compliance procedures and who directly benefited a group of more than 20 appellants involved in compliance proceedings. Relying on <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886 (1984), the Board suggested that the results obtained would generally be subsumed in the lodestar fee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has never awarded quality enhancements, and it seems unlikely that it will. <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 150-51 (1987), reversed an enhancement directed by the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note initially that the administrative judge enhanced the award based on the quality of representation and not the result obtained, as the agency terms it. The results obtained generally will be subsumed in other factors used to calculate a reasonable fee, therefore, it normally does not provide an independent basis for increasing the fee award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. at 888-89. The quality of representation, too, is generally reflected in the hourly rates. It may justify an upward adjustment, therefore, only in the rare case where the fee applicant shows that the quality of services rendered was superior to what one should expect in light of the hourly rates charged and that the success was exceptional. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that the appellant's counsel has not met the burden in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As reasons to enhance the fee award on the quality of representation factor, the administrative judge found that, in this appeal, the appellant's counsel was able to prove...that the agency had discriminated...committed numerous prohibited personnel practices...harmful procedural error....&#8197;[T]he appellant's successful appeal to the Board generated media publicity and resulted in the...Postmaster General initiating an investigation of the agency facilities....&#8197;We do not find that these are sufficient reasons to enhance a fee award by 50%.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span>, the Supreme Court admonished that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen an attorney first accepts a case and agrees to represent the client, he obligates himself to perform to the best of his ability and to produce the best possible results commensurate with his skill and his client's interests. Calculating the fee award in a manner that accounts for these factors, either in determining the reasonable number of hours expended on litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rate, thus adequately compensates the attorney, and leaves very little room for enhancing the award based on his post-engagement performance. In short, the lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors comprising a 'reasonable' attorney's fee, and it is unnecessary to enhance the fee for superior performance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">106 S. Ct. at 3098-99.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed below, the hourly rates charged by the appellant's counsel are the prevailing community rates. Because the quality of a prevailing party's attorneys' representation is normally reflected in the reasonable hourly rate, the overall quality of performance ordinarily should not be used to adjust the lodestar....&#8197;Further, the evidence...fails to indicate that the lodestar amount does not provide a reasonable fee award reflecting the quality of representation provided....&#8197;[T]he administrative judge considered counsel's skill and expertise, as well as the degree of success they achieved, in determining both that their hourly rate was reasonable...and that the hours charged to the case were reasonably expended....&#8197;[W]e find that an enhancement of the lodestar amount by 50% based on the quality of representation is not warranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But when it appeared that quality enhancements under fee shifting statutes were not to be, the Supreme Court issued <span class="Italic">Perdue v. Kenny A</span>., <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-970.pdf">130 S. Ct. 1662</a> (2010).<span class="Italic"> Kenny A.</span> involved a civil rights case and a fee application under 42 USC 1988 stemming from a class action seeking improvements within the State of George of a foster-care system involving 3,000 children in two counties. Successful counsel filed a fee petition for $14 million, half of it based on their lodestar amount and the other half based on a fee enhancement for superior work and results. The district court awarded $10.5 million, including an enhancement for quality work, and that result was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit. The Supreme Court remanded the case for redetermination based upon a factor analysis rather than upon the district court's subjective estimate of the quality of the representation. The factors permitting, but not requiring, enhancement for quality work and results achieved were expressed in the Court's opinion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting statutes have established six important rules that lead to our decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, a "reasonable" fee is a fee that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case.<span class="Italic"> See Delaware Valley I</span>, 478 U.S., at 565 ("[i]f plaintiffs...find it possible to engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he will be paid a 'reasonable fee,' the purpose behind the fee shifting statute has been satisfied"); <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 897 ("[A] reasonable attorney's fee is one that is adequate to attract competent counsel, but that does not produce windfalls to attorneys" (ellipsis, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)). Section 1988's aim is to enforce the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide "a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys." <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I, supra</span>, at 565.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is presumptively sufficient to achieve this objective. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dague</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 562; <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I, supra</span>, at 565; <span class="Italic">Blum, supra</span>, at 897; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Gisbrecht</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 801-802. Indeed, we have said that the presumption is a "strong" one. <span class="Italic">Dague</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 562; <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I, supra</span>, at 565.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, although we have never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance,<span class="Italic"> see</span> Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 12, 17, we have repeatedly said that enhancements may be awarded in "'rare'" and "'exceptional'" circumstances. <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I, supra</span>, at 565; <span class="Italic">Blum, supra</span>, at 897; <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S., at 435.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, we have noted that "the lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a 'reasonable' attorney's fee," <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I, supra</span>, at 566, and have held that an enhancement may not be awarded based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation,<span class="Italic"> see Dague</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 562-563; <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania</span> v<span class="Italic">. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air</span>, 483 U.S. 711, 726-727 (1987) <span class="Italic">(Delaware Valley II)</span> (plurality opinion); <span class="Italic">Blum,</span> 465 U.S., at 898. We have thus held that the novelty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as a ground for an enhancement because these factors "presumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable hours recorded by counsel." <span class="Italic">Ibid.</span> We have also held that the quality of an attorney's performance generally should not be used to adjust the lodestar "[b]ecause considerations concerning the quality of a prevailing party's counsel's representation normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate." <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley I, supra</span>, at 566.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fifth, the burden of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee applicant. <span class="Italic">Dague</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 561; <span class="Italic">Blum,</span> 465 U.S., at 901-902.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4689"></span>Finally, a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must produce "specific evidence" that supports the award. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 899, 901 (An enhancement must be based on "evidence that enhancement was necessary to provide fair and reasonable compensation"). This requirement is essential if the lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, providing a calculation that is objective and capable of being reviewed on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of what we have said in prior cases, we reject any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation. The lodestar method was never intended to be conclusive in all circumstances. Instead, there is a "strong presumption" that the lodestar figure is reasonable, but that presumption may be overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately take into account a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we are asked to decide whether either the quality of an attorney's performance or the results obtained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an enhancement. We treat these two factors as one. When a plaintiff's attorney achieves results that are more favorable than would have been predicted based on the governing law and the available evidence, the outcome may be attributable to superior performance and commitment of resources by plaintiff's counsel. Or the outcome may result from inferior performance by defense counsel, unanticipated defense concessions, unexpectedly favorable rulings by the court, an unexpectedly sympathetic jury, or simple luck. Since none of these latter causes can justify an enhanced award, superior results are relevant only to the extent it can be shown that they are the result of superior attorney performance. Thus, we need only consider whether superior attorney performance can justify an enhancement. And in light of the principles derived from our prior cases, we inquire whether there are circumstances in which superior attorney performance is not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation. We conclude that there are a few such circumstances but that these circumstances are indeed "rare" and "exceptional," and require specific evidence that the lodestar fee would not have been "adequate to attract competent counsel," <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 897 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used in determining the hourly rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the attorney's true market value, as demonstrated in part during the litigation.[5] This may occur if the hourly rate is determined by a formula that takes into account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)[6] or perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, an enhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is compensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in cases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes. But in order to provide a calculation that is objective and reviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney's hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorney's ability to a prevailing market rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Respondents correctly note that an attorney's "brilliant insights and critical maneuvers sometimes matter far more than hours worked or years of experience." But as we said in <span class="Italic">Blum</span> v. <span class="Italic">Stenson,</span> 465 U.S. 886, 898 (1984), "[i]n those cases, the special skill and experience of counsel should be reflected in the reasonableness of the hourly rates."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Salazar</span> v. <span class="Italic">District of Columbia,</span> 123 F. Supp.2d 8 (DC 2000); <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> v. <span class="Italic">Northwest Airlines, Inc.</span>, 572 F. Supp. 354 (DC 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part,</span> 746 F. 2d 4 (CADC 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, an enhancement may be appropriate if the attorney's performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted. As Judge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to represent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay the attorney, the attorney presumably understands that no reimbursement is likely to be received until the successful resolution of the case, 532 F. 3d, at 1227, and therefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reimbursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual cases. In such exceptional cases, however, an enhancement may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement must be calculated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying outlays of expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, there may be extraordinary circumstances in which an attorney's performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to be compensated under &#x00A7; 1988 presumably understands that payment of fees will generally not come until the end of the case, if at all. <span class="Italic">See</span> 532 F. 3d, at 1227 (opinion of Carnes, J.). Compensation for this delay is generally made "either by basing the award on current rates or by adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its present value." <span class="Italic">Missouri</span> v<span class="Italic">. Jenkins</span>, 491 U.S. 274, 282 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we do not rule out the possibility that an enhancement may be appropriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the face of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is unjustifiably caused by the defense. In such a case, however, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a method similar to that described above in connection with exceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant performance enhancements on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more common. As we have noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it provides a rough approximation of general billing practices, and accordingly, if hourly billing becomes unusual, an alternative to the lodestar method may have to be found. However, neither respondents nor their <span class="Italic">amici</span> contend that that day has arrived. Nor have they shown that permitting the award of enhancements on top of the lodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the general run of cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are told that, under an increasingly popular arrangement, attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate but receive a bonus if certain specified results are obtained, and this practice is analogized to the award of an enhancement such as the one in this case. The analogy, however, is flawed. An attorney who agrees, at the outset of the representation, to a <span class="Italic">reduced hourly rate</span> in exchange for the opportunity to earn a performance bonus is in a position far different from an attorney in a &#x00A7; 1988 case who is compensated at the <span class="Italic">full prevailing rate</span> and then seeks a performance enhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the litigation has concluded. Reliance on these comparisons for the purposes of administering enhancements, therefore, is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the District Court did not provide proper justification for the large enhancement that it awarded. The court increased the lodestar award by 75% but, as far as the court's opinion reveals, this figure appears to have been essentially arbitrary. Why, for example, did the court grant a 75% enhancement instead of the 100% increase that respondents sought? And why 75% rather than 50% or 25% or 10%?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District Court commented that the enhancement was the "minimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary to reasonably compensate [respondents'] counsel." 454 F. Supp.2d, at 1290. But the effect of the enhancement was to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than $866 per hour, and the District Court did not point to anything in the record that shows that this is an appropriate figure for the relevant market.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District Court pointed to the fact that respondents' counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses and had to wait for reimbursement, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> at 1288, but the court did not calculate the amount of the enhancement that is attributable to this factor. Similarly, the District Court noted that respondents' counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis while the case was pending, but the court did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the record that the delay here was outside the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on &#x00A7; 1988 for the payment of their fees or quantify the disparity. Nor did the court provide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraordinary and unwarranted delay. And the court's reliance on the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding in <span class="Italic">Dague</span>.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 505 U.S., at 565.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, insofar as the District Court relied on a comparison of the performance of counsel in this case with the performance of counsel in unnamed prior cases, the District Court did not employ a methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review. Needless to say, we do not question the sincerity of the District Court's observations, and we are in no position to assess their accuracy. But when a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impressionistic basis, a major purpose of the lodestar method--providing an objective and reviewable basis for fees,<span class="Italic"> see id.,</span> at 566--is undermined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Determining a "reasonable attorney's fee" is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988 (permitting court, "in its discretion," to award fees), but the judge's discretion is not unlimited. It is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination, including any award of an enhancement. Unless such an explanation is given, adequate appellate review is not feasible, and without such review, widely disparate awards may be made, and awards may be influenced (or at least, may appear to be influenced) by a judge's subjective opinion regarding particular attorneys or the importance of the case. In addition, in future cases, defendants contemplating the possibility of settlement will have no way to estimate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge enhancement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marek</span> v. <span class="Italic">Chesny,</span> 473 U.S. 1, 7 (1985) ("'[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney's fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1988 serves an important public purpose by making it possible for persons without means to bring suit to vindicate their rights. But unjustified enhancements that serve only to enrich attorneys are not consistent with the statute's aim. In many cases, attorney's fees awarded under &#x00A7; 1988 are not paid by the individuals responsible for the <span id="Page_4690"></span>constitutional or statutory violations on which the judgment is based. Instead, the fees are paid in effect by state and local taxpayers, and because state and local governments have limited budgets, money that is used to pay attorney's fees is money that cannot be used for programs that provide vital public services. <span class="Italic">Cf. Horne v. Flores</span>, 129 S. Ct. 2579, 2594 (2009) (payment of money pursuant to a federal-court order diverts funds from other state or local programs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For all these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
