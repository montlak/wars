<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency changed conditions of employment</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the memorandum did not change conditions of employment, but served as a "reminder to supervisors of the long-standing <span id="page_2346"></span>policy that allowed employees to be reimbursed for telephone calls only if the employees incurred an actual cost." The Arbitrator found, and it is undisputed, that the Agency had existing practices relating to phone-call reimbursement (using any device to make phone calls) made during work-related travel. But, relying on the Agency's witness testimony, he found that the Agency did not have an existing national policy specifically addressing cellular-phone-call reimbursement, and that practices related to this reimbursement varied throughout the Agency. On this basis, the Arbitrator found that the memorandum established a national policy specifically addressing cellular-phone-call reimbursement, which "changed, at least with respect to some local practices, the procedures for claiming reimbursement." The Arbitrator also found that the memorandum's "policy is being used to justify going well beyond the travel [-]reimbursement practices previously in effect," and he identified an Agency facility that changed its practice from requiring itemized costs of calls to also requiring the dates of calls and to whom calls were made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's factual findings as nonfacts. Therefore, the Authority defers to them.[62] Further, the Arbitrator's factual findings support his conclusion that the Agency changed employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[62]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DHS</span>, 65 FLRA at 872.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support its argument regarding no change, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Groton, Connecticut (Navy)</span>.[63] In <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, the Authority upheld a judge's decision that found that an agency did not change conditions of employment when it distributed checklists to aid supervisors in implementing an already-existing program.[64] Unlike in Navy, here the Arbitrator found that the Agency did <span class="Italic">not</span> have an existing policy that specifically applied to reimbursement for cellular-phone calls. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Navy</span> is distinguishable from this case and provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the Agency changed conditions of employment.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[64]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in finding that the Agency changed employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The change in conditions of employment is not de minimis.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that any change in working conditions resulting from the memorandum was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's decision to issue the memorandum directing a national policy on cellular-phone-call reimbursement changed the procedures for claiming reimbursement, and that change affected whether employees would be granted or denied reimbursement. As to the nature and extent of the effect, the Arbitrator found, and it is undisputed, that "[t]he record in this matter showed that at least some employees were denied reimbursement for cell[-]phone calls for which they claimed to have actually incurred additional charges." The Arbitrator also considered the Union's alleged effects, including employees being "led to believe that [the Agency] no longer pays for personal calls when an employee is in a travel status" and being asked to itemize whom they called and how long those phone calls lasted. Based on the foregoing, the Arbitrator rejected the Agency's argument that the issuance of the memorandum had only a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect. That conclusion is consistent with Authority precedent, including precedent finding that changes that have financial consequences for employees may be greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.[71]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the principles set forth above, the Arbitrator's factual findings support his conclusion that the nature and extent of the effects of the change on bargaining-unit employees' conditions of employment was greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.[72]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[72]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., IRS</span>, 64 FLRA at 977.</p>

<p class="noindent">If it is unclear whether the arbitrator applied statutory analysis to a grievance that arguably presents a ULP, e.g., interference in union activities, FLRA will not set the award aside if application of statutory analysis will not alter the result, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Border Patrol Council and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 67 FLRA 361, 366 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed previously, the Union did raise &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) before the Arbitrator. But, in framing the issue regarding anti-Union <span class="Italic">animus</span>, the Arbitrator did not cite &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) or state whether he: (1) considered the animus issue to be statutory, or purely contractual, in nature; or (2) viewed Articles 4.E and 6.C of the CBA to impose the same requirements as the Statute. In the latter connection, the Authority has applied statutory standards in assessing the application of contract provisions that mirror, or are intended to be interpreted in the same manner as, the Statute.[86] And the Authority has assumed, without deciding, that an arbitrator addressed statutory issues where: (1) it was unclear what type of issues the arbitrator addressed; and (2) even assuming that the arbitrator addressed statutory standards, the award was not contrary to those standards.[87] As it is unclear whether the Arbitrator resolved statutory issues--and, for the reasons discussed below, the award is not contrary to the pertinent statutory standards--we assume, without deciding, that the Arbitrator resolved statutory issues.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Union claims that the Arbitrator applied the wrong standard for determining whether &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) was violated. Although the Arbitrator did not expressly set out the Authority's standard for finding a &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) violation, that does not provide a basis for finding the award contrary to law. In this regard, in conducting <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusion--not his or her underlying <span class="Italic">reasoning</span>--is consistent with the relevant legal standard.</p>

<p class="noindent">If a party desires that an arbitrator resolve a ULP issue, the issue should be stated plainly to the arbitrator so that the ULP issue is directly resolved by the award. Without a stipulation concerning the issue, however, the parties may be at the mercy of the arbitrator who frames the issues to be resolved, as in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and DOD, DCAA, Central Region</span>, 57 FLRA 464, 466 (2001), remanding a case for further consideration by an arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no reason to believe that statutory ULPs were excluded from the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. As a result, if a statutory ULP claim was properly before the Arbitrator, he had authority to resolve it. However, while the Union clearly alleged a statutory ULP during the steps of the grievance process, the issues the Arbitrator describes as having been framed by the parties for the Arbitrator did not include a reference to a statutory ULP. Also, the parties did not stipulate to the issues to be resolved. Therefore, the record is not clear whether a statutory ULP claim was an issue that had been specifically submitted to be resolved by arbitration. In this connection, it is possible that the Arbitrator did not formulate the issues to include a statutory ULP claim because the Union did not formally submit any such claim to be resolved. If that is the case, then the Arbitrator's statement regarding his authority <span id="page_2347"></span>to resolve ULPs would be <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, because statutory ULP findings by the Arbitrator would not be essential to resolving the Union's claim that the Agency's actions violated the parties' agreement. It is also possible that the Arbitrator did not formulate the issues to include a statutory ULP claim, though such a claim was properly submitted, because he mistakenly believed that it was not within his authority to resolve statutory ULPs. If that is the case, then an analysis of the merits of the Union's statutory ULP claim would be essential to resolving this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because it is necessary for us to know whether a statutory ULP claim was properly submitted to the Arbitrator in this case, and it is our practice to defer to an arbitrator's authority to formulate the issues, we direct the Arbitrator, on remand, to clarify whether the Union's statutory ULP claim was properly submitted to him. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dep't of the Navy, Navy Pub.</span> <span class="Italic">Works Ctr., Norfolk, Va., </span>54 FLRA 338, 341 (1998) (when the parties do not stipulate an issue to be submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator's formulation of the issues is accorded substantial deference by the Authority). Our decision to defer to an arbitrator's authority to formulate the issues is consistent with our precedent of remanding cases for resolution by the arbitrator, absent settlement by the parties, where the arbitrator erroneously concluded that he or she did not have authority to resolve an issue of law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 858,</span> 47 FLRA 481 (1993) (award in which arbitrator erroneously determined that he lacked authority to resolve whether implementation of an Equal Opportunity/Civil Rights critical element was consistent with law remanded to parties for resubmission to arbitrator for resolution); <span class="Italic">Alabama Ass'n of Civilian Technicians,</span> 52 FLRA 1386 (1997) (award in which arbitrator erroneously determined that he had no jurisdiction to resolve request for attorney fees remanded to parties for resubmission to the arbitrator for purposes of rendering award on merits of attorney fee question).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union does not clearly present a ULP argument to an arbitrator, it is unlikely that FLRA will permit the ULP to be raised for the first time on exceptions to the resulting award. The injection of ULP issues for the first time in exceptions "could significantly expand the number of decisions subject to judicial review, thereby undercutting Congress' intent that arbitration awards be final." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 507 and VAMC West Palm Beach</span>, 58 FLRA 378, 379-80 (2003); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 507 and VAMC West Palm Beach</span>, 58 FLRA 578, 580 (2003) (FLRA declined to apply statutory standards governing notice of formal meetings to arbitrator's award that only interpreted contract language); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">ACT New York State Council and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau New York Div</span>., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-164.html">60 FLRA 890</a>, 891 (2005), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied,</span> <span class="blue">61 FLRA 664</span> (2006) (if arbitrator is left to decide issue, and arbitrator defines the issue relative to contract interpretation, on exceptions party cannot successfully complain that arbitrator did not analyze case under ULP theory).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When a grievance under section 7121 of the Statute involves an alleged unfair labor practice, arbitrators must apply the same standards and burdens that would be applied by an administrative law judge in a ULP proceeding under section 7118. In a grievance alleging a ULP by an agency, the union bears the burden of proving the elements of the alleged ULP by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 940 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>, 52 FLRA 1429, 1438-39 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs, Philadelphia</span>). However, as in other arbitration cases, including those where violations of law are alleged, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's findings of fact. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 243</span>, 52 FLRA 358, 367 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award may be remanded for resubmission to the parties if it is unclear from the award whether the arbitrator treated an alleged bargaining failure as a statutory violation or as a contract violation. If a statutory violation is resolved, or if a contract provision mirroring the statute is involved, FLRA law is to be applied, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3974 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI McKean</span>, 67 FLRA 306, 308-10 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several aspects of the award are unclear.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin, it is unclear whether the Arbitrator addressed a contractual-duty-to-bargain issue, a statutory-duty-to-bargain issue, or both. There are some indications that the Arbitrator addressed a contractual issue. Specifically, he framed the issue as "[w]hether the Agency violated the parties'...agreement," not the Statute. In addition, he cited as "[r]elevant" certain contract provisions that do not mirror provisions of the Statute, including: &#x00A7; 4b., which identifies when the parties must "agree[&#8197;]...in writing" to particular changes; and &#x00A7; 4c., which refers to matters that "will be negotiated" by the parties. On the other hand, the Arbitrator cited as relevant &#x00A7; 3c. of the parties' agreement, which the Authority has found to "mirror" the bargaining obligations set forth in the Statute.[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is critical to ascertain whether the Arbitrator addressed only a contractual issue, only a statutory issue, or both issues because, to the extent that he addressed a statutory issue, he was required to apply the following statutory-duty-to-bargain principles.[49] Prior to implementing a change in conditions of employment, an agency is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain--<span class="Italic">if</span> that change will have more than a "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" effect on bargaining-unit employees' conditions of employment.[50] In assessing whether the effect of a change is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on unit employees' conditions of employment.[51] In addition, if the agency's decision to make a change involves the exercise of a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, then the substance of the agency's decision is not subject to negotiation.[52] But, under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Statute, the agency still must bargain over the impact and implementation of that decision.[53] Further, a union may waive its right to bargain over a proposed change, either explicitly or implicitly through inaction.[54] In this regard, the agency may implement the proposed changes if, among other things, the union fails to request bargaining within a reasonable period of time after being notified of the proposed changes,[55] fails to submit any bargaining proposals[56] (or any negotiable proposals)[57] within a contractual or other agreed-upon time limit,[58] or fails to bargain.[59]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It also is unclear whether the award is consistent with these statutory standards. The parties make three arguments in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union argues that the Arbitrator erroneously found that the Agency had no duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of the change. But it is unclear whether the Arbitrator made such a finding, or whether he found no duty to bargain over only the <span class="Italic">substance</span> of the change. In this regard, he made several statements regarding whether the Agency had an obligation to negotiate over "the change"--which could refer to substantive bargaining. However, in his "[a]ward," the Arbitrator stated that the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement "when it removed the...turnstile...without negotiating the <span class="Italic">implementation</span> with the Union"--which indicates that he may also have found no duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of the change. There is no dispute that the Agency exercised its management right to determine internal-security practices when it made the change. Thus, if the Arbitrator found no duty to bargain over the substance of the change, then that finding is consistent with the legal principles set <span id="page_2348"></span>forth above;[63] if he found that there was no duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of that change solely because it involved the exercise of a management right, then that finding is not consistent with the legal principles set forth above.[64] In order for the Authority to determine whether the award is contrary to law, it is necessary for the Arbitrator to clarify this point.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[64]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency claims that the Arbitrator found that bargaining was excused because the effects of the change were only <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. In this regard, the Arbitrator stated that "the decision to replace the turnstile absolutely was a matter of internal security first and foremost, and its impact, if any, on working conditions was secondary and relatively minimal." It is unclear from this statement whether the Arbitrator: (1) assessed the effects, or the reasonably foreseeable effects, of the change on unit employees' conditions of employment, and found that the effects were <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>; or, instead, (2) determined that, because the installation of the gate involved an internal-security decision, the impact on employees was necessarily minimal. The latter finding would be incorrect because the effects of a change may be greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> even when the change involves the exercise of a management right.[67] This point also must be clarified in order for the Authority to be able to assess whether the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[67]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP, El Paso, Tex</span>., 67 FLRA 46, 49-50 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, according to the Agency, the Arbitrator properly found no bargaining obligation because the Union waived its right to bargain. As relevant here, the Arbitrator found that when the Agency notified the Union president about the proposed change, the Union president "did not raise any objections to management's plans, and he stated that he only wanted to <span class="Italic">see</span> the [gate]." The Arbitrator also found that, when the Agency was ready to install the gate, the Union president "indicated that he was done dealing with the issue and no longer was concerned about seeing the [gate]." Additionally, the Arbitrator found that "other Union staff members" expressed concerns about the gate, including the Union's vice president, who "expressly informed management that he was opposed to the turnstile's replacement and that the Union wished to negotiate over the proposed change." The Arbitrator then stated that the Agency: (1) "inform[ed] the Union of the change, and...engage[d] in several discussions with different Union officials about the impact and implementation" of the change; and (2) "was not required to do any more before implementing" the change. It is unclear whether, by making these findings, the Arbitrator intended to find that the Union waived its right to bargain over the proposed change, either explicitly or through inaction. If the Arbitrator properly found a waiver of the right to bargain, then a finding of no statutory violation would be consistent with the legal principles set forth above.[73] This point also must be clarified in order for the Authority to resolve the Union's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[73]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">CBP</span>, 62 FLRA at 265</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, it is unclear whether the Arbitrator intended to find no duty to bargain over only the substance of the change, and whether he found that the Agency's bargaining obligation was excused because the change was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> or the Union waived its right to bargain. Given this lack of clarity--and the lack of clarity regarding whether the Arbitrator even intended to address a statutory-duty-to-bargain issue--we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for clarification as to what issue or issues he was addressing. In the event that the parties return to the Arbitrator and he clarifies that he resolved a statutory-duty-to-bargain issue, then the Arbitrator must also address how the award comports with the pertinent statutory standards set forth above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, as it is unclear what contract provisions the Arbitrator relied on in finding no contract violation--including whether he relied on contract provisions that differ from the Statute in any way--we are unable to resolve the Union's essence exception at this time. Accordingly, if the parties return to the Arbitrator, then he must clarify his contractual analysis as well.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union maintains that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by "making a determination to relieve the Agency of [i]mplementation negotiations." However, the Union makes no claim that the Arbitrator failed to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration or resolved an issue not submitted to arbitration. The Union also points to no specific limitation in the agreement concerning the Arbitrator's remedial authority. As such, the Arbitrator did not exceed his authority by requiring a "negotiable impact remedy that goes to appropriate arrangements[.]" Award at 19. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, Phoenix, Ariz., </span>62 FLRA 214, 215 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting; Member Pope dissenting as to other matters) (excepting party failed to identify a specific contractual limitation on arbitrator's remedial authority);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 4044, Council of Prisons Local 33</span>, 57 FLRA 98, 99 (2001) (arbitrator did not exceed his authority where he did not disregard specific limitations on his authority and award is directly responsive to the issues before him).

<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the remedy is not contrary to law.&#x2003;In this regard, in cases where arbitrators resolve ULP allegations, the Authority upholds the arbitrator's remedy unless it is "a <span class="Italic">patent</span> <span class="Italic">attempt</span> to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]."

In this case, applying the foregoing standards, the Agency fails to establish that the award, requiring the Commissioner of IRS to sign the notice, constitutes a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those that effectuate the policies of the Statute.

<p class="noindent">Discretion notwithstanding, the arbitrator should invoke proper law before a remedy is selected, <span class="Italic">NTEU and FDIC</span>, 48 FLRA 566, 570-72 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award is deficient to the extent that the Arbitrator refused to consider whether he should direct certain remedies because of his view that he was not empowered to order such relief.&#x2003;Specifically, we find that the Arbitrator's determination that he was not authorized to award a retroactive bargaining order is deficient as contrary to the Statute. In addition, we are persuaded that the Arbitrator likewise refused to award a cease and desist order and the posting of a notice based on his view that he was not empowered to award such relief. We find that the refusal to consider those remedies also conflicts with the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 963 F.2d 429 (D.C. Cir. 1992), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently addressed the choice of forums granted in section 7116(d) of the Statute where the aggrieved party has the option of raising an issue as an unfair labor practice or as a grievance. The court found that "[b]y providing for a <span class="Italic">choice</span> of forum, section 7116(d) assumes that a similar analytical approach would be followed--if not the same result reached--by both the arbitrator and the Authority with respect to matters over which there is concurrent jurisdiction." 963 F.2d at 438 (emphasis in original). The court further indicated that if the approaches were not required to be similar the promise of a choice of forums under section 7116(d) would be illusory. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Consequently, we conclude that an arbitrator is empowered to fashion the same remedies in the arbitration of a grievance alleging the commission of an unfair labor practice as those authorized under section 7118 of the Statute. For arbitrators to refuse to consider the remedies authorized by section 7118 of the Statute because they determine that they are not empowered to grant such relief is not consistent with the framework of the Statute, and we will find that such determinations are deficient. In our view, to find otherwise would destroy the promise of a choice of forums with similar--if not identical--remedial authority, as was intended by Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, a retroactive bargaining order is a remedy authorized under section 7118 to remedy unfair labor practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Accordingly, we find that the award is deficient to the extent that the Arbitrator refused to consider a retroactive bargaining order as relief because, in his view, he was not empowered to do so. Similarly, an order directing that a respondent cease and desist from violating the Statute and post a notice of its commission of an unfair labor practice and the action it will take to remedy the violation are routine elements of any relief ordered by the Authority to remedy an unfair labor practice. Although the Arbitrator did not specifically state, as he did with respect to retroactive bargaining orders, that he was not empowered to order the Agency to cease and desist and post a notice, we believe that his statement that he was "not the Authority" expressed his view that he was not authorized to order such relief. Accordingly, we find that the award is also deficient to the extent that he erroneously concluded that he could not award such relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will remand this matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator.&#x2003;On resubmission, the Arbitrator must consider under the same remedial approach applied by the Authority whether in his judgment a cease and desist order, a posting, and the issuance of a retroactive bargaining order are appropriate relief to remedy the Agency's violation of the Statute in failing to provide notice to the Union and an opportunity to bargain over the impact and implementation of its decision to contract out the management of small assets.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's claims that the award is deficient because it fails to award a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy and backpay. Our decision assures that, as effectively required by section 7116(d), the proper remedial approach is followed by the Arbitrator. In choosing to file a grievance rather than filing an unfair labor practice with the Authority, the Union chose the judgment and discretion of the Arbitrator rather than that of the Authority. We will not disturb that choice by substituting our judgment for that of the Arbitrator when there is no basis in the record submitted for concluding that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy or a backpay remedy is compelled by the Statute. We believe that we should review the remedy determinations of the Arbitrator just as our remedies in unfair labor practice cases are reviewed by the Federal courts of appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 33 and Internal Revenue Service, Phoenix District</span>, 44 FLRA 252, 276 (1992). We should uphold an arbitrator's remedy determinations unless it can be shown that these determinations are "a <span class="Italic">patent attempt</span> to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d at 968) (emphasis in original). This "is a heavy burden indeed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d at 968).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, no basis is provided for disturbing the Arbitrator's rejection of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy. Although the Arbitrator does not cite <span class="Italic">FCI</span> [<span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution</span>, 8 FLRA 604 (1982)], in denying the remedy, that case was submitted to the Arbitrator by the parties and his award is consistent with it. Thus, consistent with the remedial approach of <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, the Arbitrator found that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy was not warranted because it would disrupt and impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's operations. Moreover, we reject the Union's claim that the denial of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is deficient because there was no basis in the record for determining that a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> would be disruptive. In our view, the Union's claim constitutes nothing more than disagreement with the Arbitrator's findings of fact, evaluation of the evidence, and reasoning and conclusions in determining that there would be a disruption and constitutes an attempt to relitigate this issue before the Authority....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, without a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy or a finding by the Arbitrator that employees suffered a loss of pay, allowances, or differentials as a direct result of the Agency's failure to bargain, no basis is provided for disturbing the Arbitrator's rejection of a backpay remedy.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Articles 3A and 25 of the parties' agreement, the Jaffe Award, and the Statute when it unilaterally implemented the new RDUs without completing bargaining with the Union over the proposals. Article 25 obligates the Agency to "notify and discuss with the Union, all proposed uniform changes, additions and deletions, prior to circulation to the field." The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated this article by demonstrating an unwillingness to compromise, failing to seriously consider the need for more than three new RDUs in the initial issuance, and unilaterally implementing the new RDU without completing bargaining. The Agency has not alleged that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 25 fails to draw its essence <span id="page_2350"></span>from the parties' agreement. Thus, even assuming that the Arbitrator misinterpreted the Agency's <span class="Italic">statutory </span>duty to bargain, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated its <span class="Italic">contractual </span>duty to bargain under Article 25 provides a separate and independent basis for directing the Agency to bargain with the Union over its proposals.[11] Accordingly, the Agency's argument that the award is contrary to the Statute because it requires the Agency to bargain over proposals concerning matters outside the scope of the Agency's change to conditions of employment--a principle that applies in cases involving <span class="Italic">statutory </span>bargaining obligations, <span class="Italic">see U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 65 FLRA 870, 872-73 (2011)--does not provide a basis for setting aside the award.[12] <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 64 FLRA at 1002. <span class="Italic">See also Broad.

<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;We note that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C.

Although the Agency correctly asserts that Article 3A places limitations on the Union by stating that Union proposals "must be responsive to either the [Agency's] proposed change or the impact of the proposed change," and restates statutory obligations by stating that "[n]othing in <span class="Italic">this article </span>shall require either party to negotiate on any matter it is not obligated to negotiate under applicable law," (emphasis added), the Agency does not allege, and there is no basis for concluding, that Article 25 similarly limits the parties' bargaining obligations or restates statutory bargaining obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the disputed proposals are non-negotiable because they are not appropriate arrangements. Although the Agency does not specify which management right the award conflicts with, the Arbitrator found, and there is no dispute, that matters concerning the RDU implicate the "method or means of performing work" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute makes clear that matters concerning the "technology, methods, and means of performing work" are negotiable "at the election of the agency[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). Consistent with this section, an agency may elect to bargain over these matters, and a contractual agreement to bargain over &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) matters is enforceable through grievance arbitration. <span class="Italic">SSA Balt.</span>, 55 FLRA at 1068-69. By finding that the Agency was bound by--and had violated--Article 25's requirements concerning the Agency's obligation to bargain over the RDU, the Arbitrator effectively found that the Agency had made a contractual election to bargain over certain &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) matters. As a result, the Agency had a contractual obligation to bargain over these proposals without regard to whether the proposals are appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Accordingly, the Agency's argument that the Union's proposals are not appropriate arrangements does not provide a basis for setting aside the award. <span class="Italic">See SSA Balt.</span>, 55 FLRA at 1068-69.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and DOD, DCAA, Central Region</span>, 57 FLRA 464, 466-67 (2001), synopsized the fundamental elements of negotiability law that can be applied by arbitrators faced with disputes over unilateral changes in working conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[P]rior to implementing a change in conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees, an agency is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Correctional Inst., Bastrop,</span> <span class="Italic">Texas</span>, 55 FLRA 848, 852 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless negotiations over a change would interfere with the exercise of a management right under &#x00A7; 7106, or would be inconsistent with federal law, government-wide rule or regulation, or an agency regulation for which a compelling need exists, an agency is required to bargain over the actual decision, or substance, of the change. <span class="Italic">Cf. NFFE Local 1379, </span>44 FLRA 1246, 1248 (1992) (&#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute removes from the duty to bargain specified management rights; &#x00A7; 7117 of the Statute excludes from the duty to bargain matters that are inconsistent with federal law, government-wide rule or regulation, or an agency regulation for which a compelling need exists). In cases where the agency has decided to exercise a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), the agency may nonetheless be obligated to bargain over its impact and implementation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Warner Robins, </span>53 FLRA at 1668.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Arbitrator finds, on remand, that the substance of the Agency's decision was not itself subject to negotiation, then the Arbitrator must analyze whether the Agency was obligated to bargain over the impact and implementation of its decision. An agency is obligated to bargain over the impact and implementation of its decision if the resulting changes have a more than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See Dep't</span> <span class="Italic">of Health and Human Serv., Social Sec. Admin.,</span> 24 FLRA 403, 407-08 (1986) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>) (Authority found that agency was not obligated to bargain over impact and implementation of its decision to temporarily reassign employee). The standard for determining whether a particular change is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>requires an examination of the particular facts and circumstances in each case, with principal emphasis placed on an assessment "of the nature and extent of the effect or reasonably foreseeable effect of the change on conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. Equitable considerations will also be taken into account in balancing the various interests involved." <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>24 FLRA at 408; <span class="Italic">See also Social Sec. Admin., Malden Dist. Office, Malden, Massachusetts, </span>54 FLRA 531, 536 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the Agency's decision to effect the change in the online research service used by employees may be encompassed by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Section 7106(b)(1) states, as relevant here, that agencies and unions may, at the election of the agency, negotiate on "the technology, methods, and means of performing work[.]" This section includes the way in which an agency performs its work and "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">See IFPTE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 49, </span>52 FLRA 813, 818 (1996). If the Arbitrator finds that the Agency's decision was encompassed by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), and there had been an election to bargain over that matter, then the Union would be entitled, by virtue of that election, to bargain over the substance of the Agency's decision. If, on the other hand, the Arbitrator finds that the Agency has not elected to bargain, then the principles described in the preceding two paragraphs would apply.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 161</span>, 57 FLRA 718, 720-22 (2002) (agency gave proper notice of intended change in working conditions and overtime availability; arbitrator improperly awarded back pay for failure to conduct impact negotiations); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and DOD, DCAA, Central Region</span>, 59 FLRA 603, 603-04 (2004) (arbitrator did not err as matter of law by finding that mid-term bargaining was not required: there was no change in employment conditions; contract did not require bargaining under circumstances (a statutory change in the ability to secure expenses related to professional credentials and health care premiums for certain employees)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA 263, 266 (2007), noted as to a <span class="Italic">status quo </span>remedy order by an arbitrator in a failure to bargain case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority in fashioning the remedy.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency asserts that the Arbitrator had no authority to order the parties to return to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> 180 days from the date of the award if the Authority has not resolved the pending negotiability appeal. In resolving the Agency's argument, we note that the issue before the Arbitrator was stated as follows: "Whether the Agency violated the National Agreement between [the Agency] and [the Union] when it implemented [the grooming standards policy] prior to the completion of bargaining and/or by refusing to engage in post-implementation bargaining? If so, what is the appropriate remedy?" The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency violated Article 37 of the parties' agreement "and applicable provisions of law" when it implemented the revised grooming standards policy without completing bargaining with the Union. As a result, the Arbitrator ordered a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy. He stayed the remedy for a period of 60 days following the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> or for a period of 180 days after the issuance of the award, whichever comes first. The Arbitrator's award provides a remedy for a contract violation and a violation of "applicable provisions of law." The Agency makes no argument that the Arbitrator does not have authority to order a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy for a contract violation, or for a violation of "applicable provisions of law," or to stay that remedy for a period of time. Consistent with the Arbitrator's broad discretion to fashion remedies, the exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Region V</span>, 45 FLRA 737, 747 (1992). Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 989, 996-97 (2010) (aff'd, on other grounds, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP v. FLRA</span>, 647 F.3d 359, 364-66 (2011)), considered unobjectionable an arbitrator's <span class="Italic">status quo </span>remedy as FLRA considered the remedy under the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> criteria:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2351"></span>...Where an arbitrator has found a ULP and granted an SQA remedy, and a party has excepted to that remedy, the Authority has applied statutory standards to determine whether the remedy was deficient. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 63 FLRA 505, 510 (2009). Consistent with this precedent, we apply the <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factors to determine whether the SQA remedy is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factors are:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1) whether, and when, notice was given to the union by the agency concerning the action or change decided upon; (2) whether, and when, the union requested bargaining on the procedures to be observed by the agency in implementing such action or change and/or concerning appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by such action or change; (3) the willfulness of the agency's conduct in failing to discharge its bargaining obligations under the Statute; (4) the nature and extent of the impact experienced by adversely affected employees; and (5) whether, and to what degree, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">FCI</span>, 8 FLRA at 606.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first and second <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factors, the Arbitrator found that "[t]here was no notice, no opportunity to bargain--and, in fact, a refusal to do so." The Agency does not dispute that it did not afford the Union notice and an opportunity to bargain over its local assignment policy changes. Rather, the Agency reiterates its arguments that it was not required to bargain. As we have rejected these arguments above, the first and second factors support the Arbitrator's award of an SQA remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the third <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor, the parties present competing interpretations of the Arbitrator's statement--immediately preceding his finding of willfulness--that "[t]he Agency's justification for its position is sufficient." In the context of the award--particularly his express finding that "the Agency's conduct was willful"--the Arbitrator's assertion appears to be a misstatement. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In addition, the Agency's argument that its conduct was not willful under the third <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor is based upon its continued erroneous assertion that it had no bargaining obligation. The Authority has held that an agency's "erroneous belief that it had no duty to bargain does not support a conclusion that the [agency's] actions were not 'willful' for the purposes of <span class="Italic">FCI</span>." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Energy, W. Area Power Admin., Golden, Colo.</span>, 56 FLRA 9, 13 (2000). Thus, the Agency's asserted belief that it had no duty to bargain does not detract from the willful nature of the refusal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union has not yet been required to prove the damages of individual employees, the Agency "concedes that the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor is unable to be discussed at this time, but reserves its right to contest it at a later time." Notwithstanding the Arbitrator's pending determination of individual employees' entitlement to backpay, the Arbitrator's findings support a conclusion that the Agency's violation adversely affected employees. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the Union presented evidence that employees lost wages or benefits as a result of the Agency's unlawful actions, and that the parties' stipulations recognized the probability of such harm. The Agency's exceptions provide no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in this regard, or for finding that the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor warrants setting aside the SQA remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor, the Authority requires that a conclusion that an SQA remedy would be disruptive to the operations of an agency be based on record evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Montgomery, Ala.</span>, 60 FLRA 549, 555 (2005). The Agency does not cite any record evidence to support its assertion that an SQA remedy would disrupt and impair the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. Moreover, any alleged disruptiveness of the SQA remedy is mitigated by the fact that the Arbitrator stayed implementation of the SQA for 120 days following the disposition of any exceptions to afford the parties an "opportunity to bargain with respect to inspectional work assignments and to implement required transitions." In these circumstances, the Agency provides no basis for finding that the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor warrants setting aside the SQA remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 64 FLRA 504, 507 (2010), attributed no fault to the arbitrator's failure to direct a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy for the agency's failure to abide by an FSIP order:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, where the arbitrator finds that a ULP was committed, the Authority defers to the judgment and discretion of the arbitrator in the determination of the remedy. <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>48 FLRA at 571.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union makes no claim that the remedy awarded by the Arbitrator was "a <span class="Italic">patent attempt </span>to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Rather, the Union merely argues that the Authority would have awarded a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy if it had been determining the remedy in the first instance. However, as noted, this is not the standard that the Authority applies in resolving such a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 66 FLRA 10, 11-12 (2011), also determined that an arbitrator could deny a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy for the agency's failure to conduct implementation bargaining:</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;We assume, without deciding, that the Arbitrator found a violation of not only the CBA, but also the Statute. In this connection, although the Agency claims that the Arbitrator found only a contractual violation, the award addresses <span class="Italic">both </span>contractual and statutory violations in the following ways: (1) the Arbitrator accepted the Union's statement of the issue that included both contractual and statutory issues; (2) the award's summary of the positions of the parties included arguments regarding both contractual and statutory issues; (3) the Arbitrator "noted without dispute, that the authority for [Article 33(b)(2)] is granted from:...[&#x00A7;] 7116(a)(1) and (5) [of the Statute]"; (4) the Arbitrator stated that, in addition to the Union having the burden to prove a contractual violation, "[t]he burden <span class="Italic">here </span>dealt with <span class="Italic">statutorily imposed obligations</span>[,]" <span class="Italic">id. </span>(emphasis added); and (5) the Arbitrator stated that "[b]eyond [the contractual violation], there was an apparent obligation to have negotiated with the Union[,]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator declined to award a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy because he found that rescinding the MSM's national training and proficiency standards would: (1) subject bargaining unit employees and the public to safety hazards; (2) increase the Agency's liability; (3) subject the Agency to additional costs in time and money; (4) affect national security interests; and (5) negatively affect Union membership because of the likelihood of the Agency's removal of the "riverine maritime program" from the bargaining unit to OAM. The Union does not assert, or provide any basis for finding, that the Arbitrator's remedy determination is a "patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 48 FLRA at 572.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's application of the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI </span>factor--"whether, and to what degree, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations"--is deficient. 8 FLRA at 606. In <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, the Authority recognized that whether <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief is warranted must be determined on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption or impairment of the efficiency and effectiveness in government operations that would be caused by such a remedy. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Arbitrator's denial of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief on the basis that it would be disruptive to the Agency's efficiency and effectiveness in its operations is consistent with these principles. Although the Union argues that the Arbitrator's finding that the rescission of the MSM would be disruptive is speculative, the Union is effectively challenging the Arbitrator's factual findings in this regard. As stated previously, in the Authority's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of an award's consistency with law, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DoD</span>, 55 FLRA at 40.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 406, 408 (2011), ascertained no impediment to an award that denied a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy for a unilateral change in working conditions:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator declined to award SQA and make-whole remedies because he found that: (1) the Agency would be required to "und[o] more than a year's worth of employment transactions"; (2) such remedies "would have a significant--and negative--impact on many current bargaining unit members, i.e., those external applicants who were awarded positions as a result of the [program] and are now members of the bargaining unit"; and (3) he was "not persuaded that...employees who would have received recruitment incentives but for the...changes [to the program] should be granted them retroactively" because the Union has no authority to negotiate whether applicants are entitled to receive recruitment incentives. Although the Union argues that the award fails to effectuate the purpose and policies of the Statute, the Union does not identify any applicable law, rule, or regulation that demonstrates that the Arbitrator's remedy determination is a "patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 48 FLRA at 572. The Union cites decisions of the Authority and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stating that SQA and make-whole relief are <span class="Italic">appropriate </span>remedies, but none of these decisions holds that these remedies are <span class="Italic">required </span>in any particular circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FDIC</span>, 977 F.2d at 1498; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 910 F.2d at 969; <span class="Italic">DOD</span>, 61 FLRA at 694-95; <span class="Italic">AF, </span>57 FLRA at 857; <span class="Italic">DOL, </span>44 FLRA at 997; <span class="Italic">DOI</span>, 33 FLRA at 680; and <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, 8 FLRA at 605-06. In addition, although the Union cites to the BPA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, as supporting its request for make-whole relief, the Arbitrator interpreted the CBA as not entitling the Union to negotiate over whether candidates for employment are entitled to receive recruitment incentives and the Authority has previously stated that "without [an SQA] remedy or a finding by the Arbitrator that employees suffered a loss of pay, allowances, or differentials as a direct result of the Agency's failure to bargain, no basis is provided for disturbing the Arbitrator's rejection of a backpay remedy." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 48 FLRA at 572.

<p class="noindent-1">The appropriateness of an SQA remedy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations that such a remedy would cause.[79] When an agency argues that an SQA remedy would disrupt the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations, the Authority requires that the agency's argument be "based on record evidence."[80]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that "but for the [2011] ABBTECH contract employees, the Agency would have had to detail or hire more employees, or assign more overtime to current bargaining[-]unit employees." She concluded that given the Agency's refusal to bargain with the Union, an SQA remedy is "appropriate[,] if not required." In so doing, the Arbitrator considered the Agency's budget constraints, including a hiring freeze, but found that the Agency made an insufficient demonstration that an SQA remedy would disrupt or have an impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the award fails to address the impact of the SQA remedy on Agency operations and to analyze the SQA remedy under the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors. The Agency, however, does not dispute the analysis under the first three <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors. The Agency acknowledges that it did not notify the Union of the 2011 ABBTECH contract. As to the fourth factor, the Arbitrator found that the change had greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effects, and the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's finding is incorrect. Accordingly, these factors support a finding that an SQA remedy is appropriate in this case.[86]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[86]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. DHS, Border &#x0026; Transp. Sec., Directorate Bureau of CBP, Wash., D.C.</span>,63 FLRA 406, 408 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception relies exclusively on the fifth factor--whether and to what degree an SQA remedy would disrupt or impair the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's operations. The Agency's claims focus on the availability of personnel to perform desk-side functions. The Agency argues that offering increased overtime to desk-side employees would not meet demands for IT services because desk-side work can "typically" be done only during normal business hours when the Agency customer is present, not during overtime hours. But as the Union points out in its opposition, overtime can effectively address Agency customer needs where the work schedules of desk-side employees do not exactly overlap those of Agency customers, or where a desk-side employee works a compressed work schedule, with a regular day off every two weeks. Also, some desk-side support can be provided outside of regular work hours. And as for the Agency's suggestion that desk-side employees would not work available overtime, the Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's finding that "there is a sufficient demonstration...that [d]esk[-]side...employees would have worked more overtime but for the contracting out of their routine work." Further, as an Agency witness acknowledged, the Agency could assign overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claims under the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor are unpersuasive for other reasons. As the Union notes, the Arbitrator's SQA remedy does not disturb any agreement between the Agency and ABBTECH for IT-contractor support that predates the 2011 ABBTECH agreement. Moreover, the Agency retains the option to detail service-desk employees to desk-side duties, and any alleged disruptiveness of the SQA remedy is mitigated by its temporary nature. Specifically, the Arbitrator's SQA remedy applies only "until the Agency and the Union bargain over the impact of the August 2011 ABBTECH contract."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons and weighing the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors, we find that the Agency has not shown that an SQA remedy is not appropriate. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the dissent's statement that we "refuse[&#8197;] to address th[e] seminal issue" of whether the Arbitrator's finding of a bargaining obligation is contrary to law. But we have addressed, above, the only contrary-to-law claims that are properly before us. We also note the dissent's assertion that the Agency's decision to contract out part of its IT functions is a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, and, "[t]herefore," that the Arbitrator's finding of a bargaining obligation "is contrary to law" because the Union "has no say." To the extent that the dissent is implying that the Union has absolutely no say in matters involving management rights, that is clearly not the case. Section 7106(a) of the Statute undoubtedly sets forth various rights that are reserved to management, but those rights are expressly "<span class="Italic">[s]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">ubject to</span>" &#x00A7; 7106(b).[98] Section 7106(b)(2) requires bargaining over the procedures that management will observe when it exercises a management right,[99] and &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) requires bargaining over appropriate arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.[100] So, when an agency makes a change that involves the exercise of management rights, the union has the right to bargain over the impact and implementation of that change[101]--precisely what the Arbitrator found here. In other words, the Union does have a say, even though its say is limited to the right to bargain impact and implementation.</p>

In this regard, where an arbitrator crafts a remedy to redress a contractual violation, the arbitrator is not required to adopt a remedy that might be appropriate in disposing of a <span class="Italic">statutory</span> violation. <span class="Italic">See Local 916</span>, 57 FLRA at 717 (contractual violation remedy based on arbitrator's interpretation of parties' agreement, rather than the Back Pay Act, not contrary to law); <span class="Italic">Chapter 68</span>, 57 FLRA at 257; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 215, Nat'l Council of SSA OHA Locals</span>, 46 FLRA 1518, 1523–24 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Council 215</span>). Specifically, where an arbitrator finds that an agency's refusal to bargain violates a collective bargaining agreement, the propriety of SQA relief is governed by the arbitrator's remedial authority under the violated agreement, rather than the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Chapter 68</span>, 57 FLRA at 257; <span class="Italic">Council 215</span>, 46 FLRA at 1523–24. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the remedy award, the Arbitrator found that SQA relief was appropriate under the parties' agreement. Although the Arbitrator did not restore the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> prior to the <span class="Italic">first</span> move, which would have required returning the employee to the studio, he found that restoring the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> prior to the <span class="Italic">second</span> move was "consistent with the intent of the...drafters" of the parties' agreement, and would satisfy the Union's "contractual" rights, because the newsroom was an office the employee had occupied in the "chain of events giving rise to the grievance." Thus, the Arbitrator's relocation of the employee to the newsroom, rather than the studio, was an appropriate exercise of the Arbitrator's "great latitude in fashioning remedies" for contractual violations.[5] <span class="Italic">See Local 916</span>, 57 FLRA at 717 (quoting <span class="Italic">Chapter 68</span>, 57 FLRA at 257). Further, because this remedy resulted from the Arbitrator's interpretation and application of the agreement, he was not required to apply the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 68</span>, 57 FLRA at 257; <span class="Italic">Council 215</span>, 46 FLRA at 1523–24. </p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that the Agency does not argue that the remedy award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator "inappropriately considered what he believed were repeated violations of Article 26, Section 4[,]" the Arbitrator's statements to which the Agency refers were dicta. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 1827</span>, 52 FLRA 1378, 1385 (1997) (<span class="Italic">NFFE</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1668</span>, 51 FLRA 714, 719 (1995)) (dicta are statements separate from the award and do not provide a basis for finding an award deficient).

Here, the Agency does not assert that the results of bargaining would be contrary to law; the Agency objects to the direction to bargain itself. Specifically, the Agency contends that the award requires it to bargain over the substance of its rights under the Statute. As the Agency's exceptions concern a live legal dispute about its rights, and not hypothetical future events, the Authority would not be issuing an advisory opinion by evaluating the exceptions. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council 215</span>, 60 FLRA at 463-64. As such, we consider the exceptions below.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 64 FLRA 462, 464-65 (2010), sustained an award resolving that a change in employment conditions of revenue officers was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, a factual finding subject to deference by FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to changing unit employees; conditions of employment, an agency must provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain under the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan.</span>, 55 FLRA 704, 715 (1999).

In assessing whether the effect of a change is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority "looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 54 FLRA 914, 919 (1998); <span class="Italic">U.S. Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 62 FLRA 341, 343 (2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found changes to have only a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>effect where they have little significance and impact, such as: the reassignment of an employee from one position back to the employee's previous, substantially similar, position, <span class="Italic">see HHS, SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; or the discontinuation of an assignment involving only a small amount of work, <span class="Italic">see Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, <span class="Italic">Portsmouth, N.H</span>., 45 FLRA 574 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, the Authority has found a change to have a greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>effect when it involves a more significant change in working conditions, such as where: employees are assigned additional tasks that they had not performed before, <span class="Italic">see SSA-Malden</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; employees' workloads increase significantly, <span class="Italic">see SSA-Gilroy</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; or a new method of assigning claims replaces a method that equalizes claims assigned to employees, <span class="Italic">see SSA-Baltimore</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several of the Union's arguments challenge the Arbitrator's factual findings that some of the alleged changes resulting from the IRM revisions--specifically, the duties performed under the ROD, the MARs, and the follow-up provision--are pre-existing policy. However, as noted above, in assessing whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are contrary to law, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's factual findings. <span class="Italic">See Ala. Nat'l Guard</span>, 55 FLRA at 40. As also noted above, we find that the award is not based on nonfacts in this regard. Accordingly, the Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred by finding that these particular revisions to the IRM were not, in fact, "changes" to conditions of employment over which the Agency had a duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the remaining revisions to the IRM, the Arbitrator found that the rotational aspect of the ROD had only a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>effect because the ROs spent seventy to eighty-five percent of their time in the office whether or not they were performing the rotating duty. In addition, the Arbitrator found that the ROD was of limited duration because it was revoked shortly after the Union filed its grievance. As for the pre-contact documentation revisions, the Arbitrator found little evidence that they resulted in additional work or would have a foreseeable impact on performance evaluations. Thus, these changes were of little significance and impact, and the Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred by finding that they were <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>within the meaning of the above-cited Authority precedent.</p>

The Union fails to establish that, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, the agreement is unenforceable. In particular, the Union does not argue, and no basis is provided for finding, that the parties were prohibited from defining through negotiations their bargaining obligations under the Statute over smoking. Consequently, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, Article 6, Section 4 is enforceable.

However, the Arbitrator expressly found that the stipulated issue before him was not "to determine whether there ha[d] been a change in working condition[s]," but, rather, "to determine whether the Agency violated Article 9 <span class="Italic">when it issued </span>the [m]emorandum...?" (emphasis in original). This finding is supported by the record evidence, which shows that the parties stipulated the issue as: "Did the Agency violate Article 9(A)...when it issued [the] Memorandum...? If so, what shall be the remedy?" Because the matter here involves a contractual violation, the Authority precedent cited by the Agency--which involves the duty to bargain under the Statute--is inapposite and provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Broad.

<p class="noindent-1">Where a grievance involves a dispute regarding a bargaining obligation as defined by the parties through an agreement, "the issue of whether the parties have complied with the agreement becomes a matter of contract interpretation for the arbitrator." <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 55 FLRA 1063, 1068 (1999) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated a contractual obligation to bargain. As such, he was interpreting the parties' agreement, not the Statute. Thus, the Authority precedent cited by the Agency--which involves the duty to bargain under the <span class="Italic">Statute</span>--is inapposite and provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law.[4] <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 55 FLRA at 1068-69.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Authority has held that where a contract provision restates a provision of the Statute, the Authority "must exercise care" to ensure that an arbitral interpretation of the contract provision is consistent with the Authority precedent interpreting the statutory provision. <span class="Italic">Gen.

<p class="noindent">A union may assert that the agency failed to fulfill a contractual bargaining requirement. If the grievance is sustained, the arbitrator may then direct a remedy that meets the need of the contract. The arbitrator is not then limited to the constraints that would be imposed on FLRA to remedy a statutory refusal to bargain case. In <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA New Cumberland and AFGE Local 2004</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-210.html">55 FLRA 1303</a>, 1307-08 (2000), the contract required the union and the agency to negotiate over a permissive matter, the scope of the competitive area. The agency refused to bargain and the union grieved. Sustaining the grievance, the arbitrator directed the agency to accept the union's proposal defining the competitive area. FLRA found the remedy unobjectionable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(12) defines "collective bargaining" under the Statute and provides that the obligation to bargain under the Statute "does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or make a concession." This case, however, does not involve the duty to bargain under the Statute. Rather, as framed and resolved by the Arbitrator, the issues in this case concerned the Agency's obligation to bargain under Article 31, Section 13 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Consequently, section 7103(a)(12) does not apply in this case and the Arbitrator was not subject to the limitations on remedial authority contained therein. Nothing in section 7103(a)(12) precluded the Arbitrator from requiring the Agency to adopt the proposed competitive areas as a remedy for its violation of Article 31, Section 13. It is well established that arbitrators have "broad authority to fashion a remedy for a violation of a collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Mint, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and</span> <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge F1-PA</span>, 51 FLRA 1683, 1686-87 (1996), quoting <span class="Italic">American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2608 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration, New York, Region 2, San Juan</span> <span class="Italic">Teleservice Center, </span>49 FLRA 1589, 1594 (1994).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When a grievance under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute involves an alleged ULP, the arbitrator must apply the same standards and burdens that would be applied by an administrative law judge in a ULP proceeding under &#x00A7; 7118. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 462, 464 (2010). An allegation of repudiation in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute is analyzed using the standard set forth by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, 375th Mission Support Squadron, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 51 FLRA 858 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>). Under that standard, the Authority examines two elements: (1) the nature and scope of the alleged breach of the agreement--i.e., was the breach clear and patent?; and (2) the nature of the agreement provision allegedly breached--i.e., did the provision go to the heart of the parties' agreement? <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 862. With regard to the first element, if the meaning of a particular agreement term is unclear and a party acts in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of that term, then that action will not constitute a clear and patent breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">E.g., SSA, N.Y., N.Y.</span>, 60 FLRA 301, 304 (2004). With regard to the second element, the Authority focuses on the importance of the provision that was breached, or allegedly breached, relative to the agreement in which it is contained. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 64 FLRA 355, 357 (2009) (Member Beck concurring in part and dissenting in part on other grounds). </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that standard here, as for the first element, as stated previously, the first sentence of &#x00A7; A.2 states: "The [Agency] shall request OPM approval for the next five years to increase the special pay schedule so as to maintain the 10% and 15% salary differentials relative to the updated GS rates, in a manner consistent with OPM regulations." There is no dispute that the Agency refused to request OPM approval. The Agency argues that this refusal did not clearly and patently breach &#x00A7; A.2 because it would not have been "consistent with OPM regulations[ ]" to make the request. However, as discussed previously, we have found that it would not have been inconsistent with OPM regulations to make the request. In addition, although the Agency asserts that a one-time breach cannot constitute a clear and patent breach of the agreement, the Authority has held that a one-time breach may constitute a repudiation, depending on the "nature and scope" of the breach. <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 861 (quoting <span class="Italic">DOD, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 40 FLRA 1211, 1219 (1991)). Further, &#x00A7; A.2 clearly requires the Agency to make a request "for the next five years[,]" Award at 8, and the Agency's refusal to do so one of those five years was in clear violation of the plain terms of that requirement. For these reasons, we find that the Agency clearly and patently breached the first sentence of &#x00A7; A.2. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the second element of the <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> test, the Arbitrator found that "the entirety of [&#x00A7;] A," including &#x00A7; A.2, "was negotiated as a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for the elimination of paper patents and the addition of customer service duties for employees[,]" and that, but for the inclusion of &#x00A7; A, "there would have been no agreement" to the MA. The Agency does not assert that these factual findings are nonfacts; rather, its only argument in this connection is that, by making these findings, the Arbitrator was "attempt[ing] to evade th[e] binding precedent[ ]" of <span class="Italic">PTO I</span>. However, as discussed previously, we have found that <span class="Italic">PTO I</span> did not bind the Arbitrator to reach a different conclusion in this case, given the differences in the record evidence before him. Thus, the Agency provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in his "<span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>" finding, and for the foregoing reasons, we find that the Arbitrator correctly determined that the Agency's breach of &#x00A7; A.2 went to the heart of the MA.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Concerning repudiation, the Authority has held that "a mere breach of a collective[-]bargaining agreement is not a [ULP] under the Statute."[60] In this case, the Arbitrator only found a violation of Article 31. Because this is "a mere breach" of the parties' agreement, rather than repudiation, it cannot form the basis of a ULP.[61]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator expressly found that the Agency violated the note-taking provision of Article 11, Section d and violated the "bargaining process" by its conduct. Other than Article II, Section d, the Arbitrator cited no other contractual provision that was violated. In our view, the Arbitrator did not find two separate, independent violations of the agreement. Rather, by stating that the bargaining process was violated, the Arbitrator was simply restating his finding that the Agency had not complied with its obligation to take notes at the parties' bargaining sessions. Therefore, we find that the Arbitrator's finding of a contract violation is limited to a violation of Article II, Section d.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator's remedy for that violation, namely, requiring the Agency to bargain, is deficient because the remedy affects the Agency's rights to assign work and to determine its internal security practices. Where an agency alleges that an award affects the exercise of management's rights, the Authority applies the test set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> 53 FLRA 146 (1997). Under that test, the Authority first determines whether an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a). If it does, the Authority then applies a two-prong test. Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, then the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I and will address prong II. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the award affects management's rights, as alleged. We also find that prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test has been met. In this regard, we note particularly that the Agency makes no claim that the award fails to satisfy prong I, insofar as it concerns the Arbitrator's finding of a violation of Article II, Section d.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that the portion of the award requiring the Agency to "begin afresh with bargaining" fails to satisfy prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. In this <span id="page_2356"></span>respect, the Arbitrator's bargaining order, whether intended to require the Agency to bargain over the substance of the change in consolidation of housing units, or only over the impact and implementation of the change, is not a proper reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated the notetaking provision of the parties' agreement. Therefore, that portion of the award must be set aside. Absent any evidence in the record as to what the appropriate remedy would be, it is proper to remand this case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine an appropriate remedy for the only contractual violation found by the Arbitrator--namely, the violation of Article II, Section d of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 53 FLRA 1344, 1347-50 (1998), reviewed an agency's objection that an award violated management rights by requiring the agency to conduct contractually-mandated impact bargaining as a precondition to reassigning an employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions to arbitration awards alleging that the award violates management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving</span> <span class="Italic">and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Under prong I of this framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute.[4] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;An agency's authority to exercise the rights enumerated in section 7106(a) of the Statute is expressly made "subject to" section 7106(b) of the Statute, which states that "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating" over matters set forth in section 7106(b). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 152. To determine whether an award enforces a provision of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b)(3), the Authority applies the framework explained in <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-14 (1990) <span class="Italic">(Customs Service)</span>. Under that framework, the Authority determines whether the collective bargaining provision enforced by the arbitrator: (1) constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, and (2) does not abrogate the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153 n.8; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Birmingham. Alabama and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2207</span>, 51 FLRA 270, 273-74 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency challenges the Arbitrator's remedy as contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. The Arbitrator directed the Agency to return the grievant to her original position to remedy the Agency's violation of Article 3, Section 3.03 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. That provision, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, requires negotiations over procedures and appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no contention that Article 3, Section 3.03 is unenforceable. Moreover, on its face, the provision appears to incorporate bargaining requirements set forth in section 7106(b)(2) and (3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the plain wording of Article 3, Section 3.03 indicates that it was intended to mitigate the adverse effects of an exercise of management's rights under the collective bargaining agreement, which parallels the Statute. As applied in this case, the Arbitrator specifically found that "the move of the grievant clearly had <span class="Italic">adverse</span> <span class="Italic">consequences for her."</span> Therefore, with regard to the first part of the <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span> test, Article 3, Section 3.03 constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. With respect to the second part of <span class="Italic">the Customs Service</span> test, an award "abrogates" a management right when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" that right. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal</span> <span class="Italic">Trades Council</span>, 39 FLRA 590, 600 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314). In this case, the Arbitrator's award does not prevent the Agency from moving the grievant; the Arbitrator specifically held that the Agency "had the right...to move the [g]rievant...[b]ut...[was] also obliged to conform" to Article 3, Section 3.03 of the parties' agreement "by fulfilling its obligation to the Union to negotiate" on procedures and appropriate arrangements. Therefore, Article 3, Section 3.03, as enforced by the Arbitrator, does not abrogate management's right to assign work under section 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we conclude, based on both the plain wording of the provision and through application of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, that Article 3, Section 3.03 was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. Accordingly, the award satisfies prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, if the Agency had complied with Article 3, Section 3.03 of the collective bargaining agreement, the Agency would have negotiated over any procedures or appropriate arrangements before it moved the grievant. Because the Arbitrator's award merely returns the grievant to her original position and requires the Agency to comply with Article 3, Section 3.03 before moving her, the award is a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement. As such, the award satisfies prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis.</p>
