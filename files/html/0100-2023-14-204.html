<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-205"><span class="space">1.</span> Pending Grievance Review</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1999 and AAFES, Dix-McGuire Exch.</span>, 2 FLRA 153, 155-57 (1979), involved a proposal requiring retention of an employee in pay status until a final determination was rendered following initiation of contract review provisions to challenge a disciplinary suspension or removal. FLRA examined the legislative history of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and 7106(b)(2) and rejected management's contentions that the stay provision unreasonably delayed the exercise of agency authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Congress did not intend subsection (b)(2) to preclude negotiation on a proposal merely because it may impose on management a requirement which would delay implementation of a particular action involving the exercise of a specified management right. Rather...subsection (b)(2) is intended to authorize an exclusive representative to negotiate fully on procedures, except to the extent that such negotiations would prevent agency management from acting at all. That is, insofar as it is consistent with the right of management ultimately to act, Congress intended the parties to work out their differences with regard to procedures in negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since Congress has clearly rejected the grounds for nonnegotiability asserted by the agency, it only remains to be determined whether the proposal at issue herein contravenes the limitations Congress did place on the negotiation of procedures under section 7106(b)(2). That is, the basic issue is whether a procedural requirement that the agency hold in abeyance implementation of the suspension or removal of an employee until that employee exhausts the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures would prevent the agency from exercising at all its statutory right to suspend or remove employees. Clearly it would not: the procedural requirement established by the proposal relates only to <span class="Italic">when</span> the suspension or removal may be effectuated, not to whether the agency ultimately will be able to implement those actions. In this respect, the only foreseeable effect of this procedural requirement upon the exercise of the statutory management rights involved is the possibility of delay and, as indicated above, Congress rejected the standard of "unreasonable delay" as the only basis for excluding proposed procedures from negotiations. Therefore, the fact that the proposal at issue herein, unlike that in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union Chapters 103 and 111 and U.S. Customs Service, Region VII</span> [2 FLRA 148 (1979)], decided in conjunction with the instant case, contains no time limits governing the various aspects of the arbitration process constitutes no impediment under the Statute to a finding that the proposal is negotiable. First of all, the absence of such time limits in the instant proposal does not in and of itself justify the conclusion that compliance with the proposal would prevent the agency from effectuating a suspension or removal action. Moreover, the agency has not shown that under the particular circumstances present in the bargaining unit involved in this case, compliance with the disputed proposal would make it impossible for the agency to implement such disciplinary actions. For these reasons, therefore, the procedural requirement in question is within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This result is consistent with and implements the intent of Congress as to the significance of the provisions of Title VII with respect to the Civil Service Reform Act as a whole.&#x2003;Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act in order to provide increased management authority, among other things, to hire and to discipline employees. However, Congress also recognized the need to provide protections for employees to balance this increased management prerogative. The grievance and arbitration provisions of Title VII, as well as the provision permitting agencies and labor organizations to negotiate fully on procedures, are among the means Congress utilized to provide such protections for employees. By its decision herein the Authority gives full effect to this Congressional intent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dix-McGuire</span> was affirmed on review in <span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140, 1152-58 (D.C. Cir. 1981), discussed in Chapter 5. The "acting at all" standard, delineating permissible procedural proposals from nonnegotiable infringements on substantive management rights, became a cornerstone for future negotiability determinations by FLRA. <span class="Italic">Dix-McGuire</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 547 and VAMC, Tampa</span>, 4 FLRA 368, 373-75 (1980) (negotiable: proposal that "[a] pending or proposed personnel action which has been made the subject of a grievance or arbitration will be stayed pending the final decision of the matter"). <span class="Italic">VAMC, Tampa</span> was also affirmed upon review in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Tampa v.

<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 requires the Agency to stay a disciplinary or adverse action against an employee who is found to use illegal drugs, until the completion of the negotiated grievance procedure or a statutory appeals procedure, or for 90 days, whichever occurs earlier. The Union states that Proposal 3 "addresses situations where the [A]gency has proposed to take disciplinary action against an employee on the basis of a positive drug test. It would not...prevent the [A]gency from taking disciplinary action based on other types of misconduct by an employee during the stay."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Executive Order 12564</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the plain wording of Proposal 3 and the Union's explanation of the proposal, we reject the Agency's assertions that Proposal 3 conflicts with sections 5(b) and (c) of Executive Order 12564.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5(b) of Executive Order 12564 provides that agencies shall initiate action to discipline an employee who is found to use illegal drugs, except where the employee: (1) voluntarily identifies himself or herself as a user of illegal drugs, or volunteers for drug testing pursuant to section 3(b) of the Executive Order before being identified as an illegal drug user through other means; (2) obtains counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program; and (3) thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the wording of the proposal and the record, we find that Proposal 3 does not preclude the Agency from initiating a disciplinary or adverse action against an employee who is found to use illegal drugs. The wording of Proposal 3 indicates that the proposal takes effect after the Agency initiates a disciplinary action and the employee files an appeal under contractual or statutory appeal procedures. As the Union states, "the [proposal] takes effect only <span class="Italic">after</span> the [A]gency has initiated disciplinary action."... Inasmuch as Proposal 3 does not preclude the Agency from initiating a disciplinary action, we conclude that Proposal 3 is consistent with section 5(b) of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_769"></span>Section 5(c) of the Executive Order provides that agencies shall not allow any employee to remain on duty in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs. Section 5(c) also provides that an agency may, in its discretion, allow an employee to return to duty to a sensitive position if it is determined that this action would not pose a danger to public health or safety or the national security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the plain wording of the proposal, we find that the proposal would not prevent the Agency from taking administrative action, including removing employees from sensitive positions pending the resolution of the employees' grievances or statutory appeals. In fact, the proposal provides that the Agency is not prevented "from exercising its right to reassign an employee during a stay if the employee occupies a position in which he may be a danger to himself or others." The Union states that "[s]ince some members of the bargaining unit occupy positions in which a person operating at a diminished capacity could pose a threat to himself or others, the proposal allows the [A]gency to reassign such employees to less sensitive duties."... By stating that the Agency may reassign an employee who could "pose a threat to himself or others," the Union acknowledges the Agency's authority under section 5(c) of the Executive Order to reassign employees who "pose a danger to public health or safety or the national security." The wording in the proposal is substantively the same as the wording in section 5(c). Therefore, we find that the proposal allows the Agency to reassign employees for the reasons set forth in section 5(c) of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that Proposal 3 allows the Agency to exercise its right to remove an employee from a sensitive position in the circumstances described in section 5(c) of the Executive Order, we conclude that Proposal 3 is consistent with section 5(c) of Executive Order 12564....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management's Right to Determine Internal Security Practices</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that an agency's use of random testing as a part of its drug testing program constitutes an exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that Proposal 3 "directly interferes with the [A]gency's internal security program which, going hand in hand with the ability to discipline may be required to be invoked in appropriate cases."... The Agency argues that "the interjection of a delay in disciplining employees...would effectively delay and curtail the implementation of an effective and efficient drug testing program in the Agency as required by [Executive Order 12564]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 addresses only disciplinary actions against employees for illegal drug use that is discovered through the drug testing program established by the Agency.&#x2003;The proposal does not prevent the Agency from establishing or implementing a drug testing program. The Agency remains free to structure its drug testing program as it chooses. The proposal also does not prevent management from testing the employee, on any ground provided in the Agency's drug testing plan, for illegal drug use during the stay period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, to the extent that the proposal would require the Agency to retain an employee found to use illegal drugs in a duty status for the period covered by the stay, thus potentially increasing the risk to its security, the proposal does not preclude management from taking other administrative actions to reduce or eliminate that risk. As we noted above, the proposal specifically provides that the Agency is free to exercise its right to reassign an employee during a stay if the employee occupies a position in which he or she may be a danger to himself or herself or to others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find that the Agency has failed to demonstrate that by providing for a stay of a disciplinary or adverse action for illegal drug use for a maximum of 90 days or pending the completion of the appropriate grievance or appeals procedures, Proposal 3 directly interferes with the Agency's ability to establish and implement a drug testing program and, thereby, directly interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. Moreover, as we found above, Proposal 3 allows the Agency to initiate discipline consistent with section 5(b) of the Executive Order and reassign employees consistent with section 5(c) of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management's Right to Discipline</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Proposal 3 directly interferes with the Agency's right to take disciplinary action because it would preclude the Agency from taking immediate disciplinary action against an employee, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), where there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime punishable by imprisonment. However, mere silence in the wording of the proposal with respect to the requirements in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) does not render the proposal outside the duty to bargain unless the proposal is inconsistent with those requirements.... In its response, the Union "acknowledges that [Proposal 3] does not override or otherwise contravene 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1)...." Because the Union expressly states that Proposal 3 is intended to be applied consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) and because the wording of the proposal is not inconsistent with the Union's statement, we find that Proposal 3 would not preclude the Agency from taking immediate disciplinary action against an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1). Consequently, we conclude that, in this respect, Proposal 3 does not directly interfere with the Agency's right to take disciplinary action consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For this reason, Proposal 3 is distinguishable from the proposal in <span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span> relied on by the Agency. The proposal in <span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span> required a 10-day delay in the implementation of any disciplinary action resulting in the removal of an employee. The proposal did not allow the agency to take immediate disciplinary action against an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) and the union did not indicate that application of the proposal would be suspended under those circumstances....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues...that Proposal 3 would allow employees to refuse, with impunity, to carry out their work assignments and the Agency would have no effective method of holding employees accountable for their work during the period of the stay. The Agency concludes that, for this reason, Proposal 3 is "'inimical to the effective conduct of public business'" and, therefore, is nonnegotiable under section 7106(a) and is inconsistent with section 7101(b) of the Statute.... We reject the Agency's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3732 and U.S. Department of Transportation, United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 205-06 (1991) (<span class="Italic">United States Merchant Marine Academy</span>), we reexamined and rejected the Authority's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span> that a proposal providing affected employees with notice of a decision to take adverse action against them directly and excessively interferes with management's rights to assign work and direct employees because management would have no effective method of holding those employees accountable for their work during the notice period. We stated that we would no longer follow the Authority's conclusions in this respect in <span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span> because we concluded that notice proposals that affected the timing of a removal action, but did not restrict management's right to respond appropriately to an employee's refusal to work during the period covered by the notice, did not directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Proposal 3 concerns a stay of a proposed disciplinary action and the proposal in <span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span> concerned notice of a proposed disciplinary action, the Agency's arguments as to the effect of the stay period on its ability to hold employees subject to the proposed discipline accountable for their work are the same as those we considered and rejected in <span class="Italic">United States Merchant Marine Academy</span>. We see no difference in this regard between a stay period and a notice period. Both a stay and prior notice concern only the timing of a disciplinary action. Moreover, just as the proposal in <span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span> did not affect management's ability to respond appropriately to an employee's refusal to work, Proposal 3 would not restrict management's ability to respond to an employee's refusal to work during the stay period. Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 3 does not directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that "the proposal for a delay in disciplinary action related to drug testing runs afoul of the [C]ircuit [C]ourt[s'] decisions both as to whether a suspension or disciplinary action will be taken and as to when it will be taken by the [A]gency."... In support of its argument, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Bureau of Land Management</span>, 873 F.2d at 1512; <span class="Italic">Treasury, BATF v. FLRA</span>, 857 F.2d at 821; and <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 862 F.2d at 880. The Agency interprets those cases as holding that a proposed delay in the implementation of a management right that "equates to a substantive restraint on the agency's ability to act," or delay that would curtail an agency's ability to implement a program, is nonnegotiable.... The Agency argues that the Union's proposal provides for just that kind of delay. The Agency asserts that the proposal "would 'freeze' the agency's ability to act promptly and decisively in the pursuit of a drug-free environment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the delay imposed by the proposal on management's right to discipline would directly interfere with the exercise of that right, we find, consistent with the Union's argument that the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, that the delay would not excessively interfere with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that, consistent with the Union's argument, Proposal 3 is intended as an arrangement for adversely affected employees. The Union states that "imposition of a penalty for illegal drug use impacts dramatically on an employee. It could result in acquiring a disciplinary record, losing pay during a suspension, or even termination."... The Union asserts that Proposal 3 "seeks to avoid these types of dire <span id="page_770"></span>consequences for employees who have been wrongfully or mistakenly accused of illegal drug use. By staying the imposition of the penalty until the selected appeals process has had a reasonable time to run its course, [Proposal 3] protects a wrongfully accused employee from the harmful effects of an improper penalty."... The proposal would benefit employees by giving them a reasonable opportunity to challenge an alleged unjust disciplinary action through the appropriate grievance or statutory procedures before the employee is forced to suffer the consequences of the discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the burden imposed by the proposal on management's right to discipline employees under its drug testing program, we note that the proposal would stay disciplinary action only for illegal drug use and would delay the imposition of the discipline only for a maximum of 90 days if an employee files a grievance or an appeal concerning that disciplinary action. Where the discipline against the employee is sustained or the 90-day period expires, the Agency may effectuate the discipline. We also note that, under the proposal, the Agency can immediately remove an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) if the Agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime punishable by imprisonment, can reassign an employee from a sensitive position if the employee is a threat to himself or herself or to others, and can discipline an employee for other misconduct during the period covered by the stay. The Agency's right to initiate disciplinary action for misconduct independent of the allegation of illegal drug use would not be affected by the proposal. Consequently, under the proposal, the Agency remains free to discipline the employee for other instances of misconduct and to respond to the consequences, if any, of the employee's illegal drug use.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the benefit to employees of being able to continue working for 90 days, or until grievance or appellate procedures are concluded, outweighs the burden that Proposal 3 imposes on the Agency by restricting the Agency's ability, except where there is reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime punishable by imprisonment, to immediately effectuate its proposed discipline. Because, under the proposal, management retains the ability to respond to misconduct by the employee and to any consequences in the workplace which might occur if the employee uses illegal drugs, the effect of the proposal on management is not as significant as the protection afforded employees, particularly those employees who are subsequently determined to have been improperly disciplined for drug use.</p>
