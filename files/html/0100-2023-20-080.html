<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-77"><span class="space">f.</span> Calculation of Appeal Period; Late IRA Appeal; Waiver</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1209.5 (2022), provides the Board's rule governing the time for filing an IRA appeal.<span class="Italic"> MacDonald v. DOJ,</span> 105 MSPR 83, 88 &#x00B6; 11, 2007 MSPB 65 (2007), explained the rule governing the timing of an IRA appeal, including an allowance for delayed receipt from OSC of the notice of the right to file an IRA appeal with the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) provides that an IRA appeal may be filed with the Board if "no more than 60 days have elapsed since notification was provided to [the] employee, former employee, or applicant for employment that [OSC's] investigation was terminated." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(ii). Similarly, the Board's regulations provide that an IRA appeal must be filed no later than 65 days after the issuance of OSC's written notification that the investigation was terminated or, if the appellant shows that OSC's notification was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 60 days after the date the appellant received the notification. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1). In this case, the appellant filed his IRA appeal 66 days after OSC issued its termination letter. Although the apparent delay in filing is minimal, the WPA does not make any provision for late filings or grant the Board the authority to waive the time limit for good cause shown. <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 592 (1992). However, the appellant may be able to show that he received the termination letter more than 5 days after its date of issuance and that his IRA appeal was therefore timely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory time limit is subject to equitable tolling, 5 CFR 1209.5 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline</span>. The appellant's deadline for filing an individual right of action appeal with the Board after receiving written notification from the Special Counsel that it is terminating its investigation of his or her allegations is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant, despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Pacilli v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 526, 530-31 &#x00B6; 10, 2010 MSPB 74 (2010) (suggesting that the statutory time limit precludes the Board from waiving the deadline even if a belated IRA appeal is the result of the neglect or misconduct of the appellant's attorney), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Pacilli v. MSPB</span>, 404 Fed. Appx. 466, 470 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (appellant failed to show a connection between her attorney's alleged misconduct and her failure to timely prosecute her IRA appeal).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 440, 442-43 (1993), applied the rule governing ordinary appeals that the appellant may file an appeal on the first business day following a period for appeal that ends on a weekend or a holiday:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge, citing <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 54 MSPR at 587, found that the time limits for IRA appeals were statutorily imposed and could not be waived and that the appeal was two days late. The Board's regulations, however, specifically provide that "[I]f the date that ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the <span id="Page_3776"></span>filing period will include the first workday after that date." 5 CFR 1201.23. The regulations governing IRA appeals, 5 CFR Part 1209, specify that, unless expressly provided, the Board will apply certain subsections, including the subsection for computation of time, of 5 CFR Part 1201 to IRA appeals. 5 CFR 1209.3. There is no contradictory provision for calculating time limits in Part 1209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure (FRAP) provide that in computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by the FRCP and FRAP, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next business day.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit applies the FRAP and does not have any specific rule or case law of its own on this issue. Its predecessor court, however, held that filing on the 91st day was timely where the 90th day of a statutorily-imposed deadline fell on Sunday. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v.

Cir. 2003 NP) (when OSC issued its closeout letter on May 15, and the appellant received the letter on May 20, five days later, the deadline was 65 days after May 15--she did not receive the OSC letter more than five days after the date of its issuance; the IRA appeal period cannot be extended for good cause); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 5 CFR 752.402 (2022) (OPM regulation: "<span class="Italic">Business day</span> means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday under 5 U.S.C. 6103(a).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCabe v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 62 MSPR 641, 644-45 (1994), involved a seemingly belated IRA appeal to MSPB. After the appellant first complained to OSC, that office apparently did not recognize that he was alleging reprisal for whistleblowing. OSC closed the case without providing the appellant notice of the right to appeal to the Board. Through subsequent correspondence, OSC learned of the nature of the appellant's complaint. Although OSC declined to reopen appellant's case, it then furnished him advice concerning Board appeal rights. The Board allowed the appellant's appeal as timely when the time for filing was calculated to start from the date OSC issued the notice of appeal rights to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may find an IRA appeal timely filed when the filing, although on time, is accomplished through an undesignated representative and the appellant later confirms his interest in pursuing the case on his own behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goode v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 93 MSPR 122, 125 &#x00B6; 8 (2002). Under <span class="Italic">King v. DHHS</span>, 71 MSPR 22, 30-32 (1996), calculation of notice of the right to initiate an IRA appeal based on issuance of an OSC letter to a representative would require a procedure to formally designate a representative and affirmative evidence that the appellant had designated a representative:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board observed in <span class="Italic">Wood [v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 587 (1992)], the statutory phrase "notification was provided" is ambiguous: it could refer to the date OSC issues its termination notice, to the date OSC mails the notice to the employee, or to the date the employee receives the notice. 54 MSPR at 591. In providing by regulation that an IRA appeal must be filed within 65 days after the date of issuance of OSC's termination notice, the Board clarified that the time for filing an IRA appeal begins to run from the date of issuance of OSC's termination notice, and allowed for five days mailing time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 591 n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By specifying that the filing period begins on the date of issuance, rather than on the date of mailing or on the date of receipt, the Board was not indicating that the latter two events are unnecessary. If OSC "issues" a notification letter, but does not mail it to an employee, or if OSC issues and mails a notification letter to an employee, but the Postal Service never delivers it, the employee could not be said to have been provided with notification as required by the statute, and the 60-day filing period provided by the statute would not begin to run.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in the instant case has provided credible and unrebutted evidence that OSC did not mail its termination notice to her. The evidence does indicate, however, that OSC mailed the termination notice to a union official who had been assisting the appellant regarding her claim of reprisal. The question to be resolved, therefore, is whether providing notice to the union official should be deemed to be providing notice to the appellant for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a proceeding before a court or quasi-judicial administrative agency, in which there are established procedures for designating official representatives, we would have no hesitation in agreeing with the proposition that notice provided to a party's duly designated representative may be imputed to the party personally. For example, our own regulations require that a designation of representative be made in writing, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.31(a), and we have consistently held that parties are bound by the actions of their chosen representatives, <span class="Italic">E.g., Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). In federal court proceedings, service upon an attorney representing a party constitutes service upon the party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b). The Supreme Court has held that it is the attorney's receipt of a notice of final administrative action regarding a federal employee's claim of employment discrimination that commences the statutory period in which to file a federal court action, and not the employee's later receipt, observing that, "[u]nder our system of representative litigation, 'each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent' and is considered to have 'notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.'" <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 91-92, 111 S. Ct. 453, 456, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC's procedures for handling a federal employee's complaint of reprisal for making whistleblowing disclosures do not resemble a "system of representative litigation." Other than the filing of a complaint, OSC's regulations do not provide for any pleadings, motions, or a hearing, and they make no provision for the appointment of legal representatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1800.1-.3. In addition, while the OSC complaint form submitted to OSC on April 7, 1994 did contain a space in which to list the identity of the "submittor," if the complaint was submitted by someone other than the appellant, this space was left blank, and the appellant was the only person who signed the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of a procedure to formally designate an official representative, and in the absence of affirmative evidence that the appellant in this case duly designated the union official as her legal representative, there is insufficient ground for finding that the union official was doing anything more than merely assisting the appellant in filing the complaint with OSC on a one-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA is remedial legislation, intended to improve protections for federal employees, and should be construed to effectuate that purpose. <span class="Italic">Mulherin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 289, 291 (1990). For the reasons set forth above, we find that OSC's notification to a union official who was assisting the appellant did not constitute notification to the appellant within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). As more than 120 days elapsed between the filing of a complaint with OSC and the filing of the IRA appeal, we find that the appeal was timely filed. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although, equitable tolling aside, the filing deadline may not be extended, the Board deems a filing sent to OSC, with a copy to the Board headquarters, styled as a request for corrective action from the Board, sufficient to initiate an IRA appeal that should have been directed to a Board regional office. The submission of a copy to the Board was "sufficient to put the Board on notice that the appellant might wish to appeal from an action of OSC." <span class="Italic">Story v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 222, 226 (1992) (applying the Board's usual rules for filing dates when a letter is received on a certain date but the postmark date cannot be ascertained); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span>, 93 MSPR 38, 47 &#x00B6; 19 (2002) (IRA appeal was deemed timely when it was submitted to the Clerk's office rather than with a regional office).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant seeks both a stay from the Board (but does not then file an appeal) and corrective action from OSC, and then files a timely appeal from OSC's notice of termination of its investigation, the appeal is timely filed. If an IRA appeal that is not filed within 20 days of a ruling on a stay request is otherwise timely filed under 5 CFR 1209.5(a)(1), it may not be dismissed on timeliness grounds; the only sanction that may be applied under 1209.5(c) is the termination of any previously granted stay. <span class="Italic">Garrett v.

<p class="Body-Text">The AJ is obligated to ensure that the appellant is aware of procedure for calculating the deadline for an IRA appeal, so that the appellant will be able properly to address a timeliness issue, <span class="Italic">Coufal v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), an IRA appeal must be filed "no more than 60 days" after "notification was provided" to the appellant by OSC that it had terminated its investigation. <span class="Italic">Moss v. Department of the Army</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 478 &#x00B6; 4 (2000). The Board's implementing regulations provide that an IRA appeal must be filed no later than 65 days after the date of issuance of OSC's written notification to the appellant that it was terminating its investigation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1). However, if an appellant shows that OSC's notification was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, the IRA appeal must be filed within 60 days after the date the appellant received OSC's notification. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Moss</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 478 &#x00B6; 4.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, OSC issued its termination letter on May 16, 2003. OSC's letter advised the appellant that she could seek corrective action with the Board within 65 days after the date of the letter. The 65th day after OSC's May 16, 2003 letter was Sunday, July 20, 2003. However, the appellant did not file her IRA appeal until Tuesday, July 22, 2003, the date that she faxed her appeal to the Board. In its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the agency also argued that the appellant's IRA appeal should be dismissed as untimely filed. In response to the agency's argument, the appellant contended that her appeal was, at most, one day late. She also provided evidence and argument that she had been hospitalized at the time the <span id="Page_3777"></span>appeal was due and, therefore, that good cause existed for any alleged untimeliness. The agency did not respond to the appellant's evidence or argument on this point, and the record indicates that the administrative judge never resolved this timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it appears that the appellant's appeal was, at least, one day late, <span class="Italic">see Pry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 440, 442-43 (1993) (holding that the filing deadline for an IRA appeal is extended to the following business day for deadlines that fall on the weekend or a Federal holiday), the record reveals that the appellant never received sufficient notice, from the administrative judge or the agency, regarding the timeliness requirements for an IRA appeal set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1). The administrative judge's orders in this case never informed the appellant regarding the timeliness requirements for an IRA appeal, and the agency's motion to dismiss only referenced the first prong of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1) and failed to inform the appellant that, if she showed that she received OSC's termination letter more than 5 days after its issuance date, her appeal would be timely if filed within 60 days after she received notification from OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, on remand, the administrative judge shall provide the appellant with notice that an IRA appeal must be filed within 65 days after the date of issuance of OSC's notification or within 60 days after the date the appellant actually received the notification if she shows that she received the notification more than 5 days after its issuance. He shall further explain that the time limit for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown. After affording the parties an opportunity to develop the record further on the timeliness issue, the administrative judge shall dismiss the alleged involuntary retirement appeal if he finds that it was untimely filed under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1). If the administrative judge finds that the appellant's IRA appeal was timely filed, he shall hold a hearing on the appellant's claim that her retirement constituted a constructive discharge within the Board's adverse action jurisdiction and adjudicate the claim.</p>
