<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-70"><span class="space">a.</span> Factual Dispute Concerning Similarity of Positions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A determination that work in one position demonstrates the knowledge, skill, and ability necessary for another requires careful job analysis of the two positions in question; titles are not determinative. To establish the relation between a classification series and a line of work, careful attention needs to be given to both the structure and content of the specific series and the meaning <span id="Page_93"></span>of "line of work" in the particular context. That two positions are in the same series does not establish that they are in the same line of work if, in addition to basic qualifications, one of the positions requires specialized knowledge, skill, and ability characterizing a specialized line of work typically different from that required to perform in the other position. Under <span class="Italic">Shobe v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 466, 471-72, 5 MSPB 468 (1981), likening to a period of probation the requirement of continuous service in the same or similar position for analysis of jurisdiction over an excepted service employee's appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the presiding official should take into consideration that a probationary period is a means of measuring the ability of a candidate to perform the work of a position and as such is an essential and integral part of the examining process. Accordingly, within this context, for purposes of determining completion of a probationary period, positions are in the same line of work if experience in a position demonstrates the knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other job. For this purpose, we believe that a line of work may be a series, a specialization in a series, a group of jobs with common qualification in a series, or even positions in several series. The determination that performance of the work of the HUD position did indeed demonstrate the knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the Postal Service position needs to be based on careful job analyses of the two positions in question, not on the titles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, in determining the relationship between a classification series and a line of work, careful attention needs to be given to both the structure and content of the specific series and the meaning of line of work hi the particular context. Thus, for example, the fact that two positions may be in the same series does not necessarily establish that they are in the same line of work for purposes of determining completion of a probationary period if, in addition to the basic qualifications, one of the positions requires specialized knowledge, skill and ability which characterize a specialized line of work which is typically different from that required to perform the other position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McAteer v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 684, 686 (1987) (letter carrier and a vehicle operation maintenance assistant are not in the same line of work); <span class="Italic">Weber v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 9 MSPR 429, 430 (1982) (accepting the AJ's conclusion that, as to an equal opportunity specialist moving between divisions and continuing to conduct investigations, it was immaterial that after the move she investigated the compliance of colleges and universities while prior to the move the job focus was on elementary and secondary schools; citing <span class="Italic">Shobe</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When there are factual disputes arising from nonfrivolous allegations concerning the similarity of the current and a prior position, a hearing is necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 188, 192 (1988) (involving "same or similar position"). Although it is the appellant's burden to establish jurisdiction, if the agency fails to provide evidence concerning the current, continuous status of the appellant's employment, the Board may, on remand, require that information to be developed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 604, 608 &#x00B6; 18 (2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The positions of police officer and immigration enforcement agent were sufficiently similar to warrant a hearing, <span class="Italic">Harvey v. DHS</span>, DE-315H-13-0102-I-1 (NP 4/10/2014) (following remand and determining the positions were dissimilar, <span class="Italic">Harvey v. DHS,</span> DE-315H-13-0102-B-1 (NP 2/11/2015)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who meets the definition of an "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) may challenge his removal from the federal service by filing an appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d). The definition of "employee" includes "a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...in an Executive agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(i). The record confirms, and the agency does not dispute the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was a preference eligible and that he had current continuous service in an Executive agency. Thus, the issue becomes whether the appellant "completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, define "similar positions" as "positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. In addition, positions may be deemed "similar" if they are in the same line of work, which has been interpreted as involving "related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have interpreted such language to mean that positions are similar "if experience in [one] position demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other job." <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 439 F.3d 1329, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Shobe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 466, 471 (1981)); <span class="Italic">Maibaum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 234, &#x00B6; 15 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction without holding a hearing. Specifically, the appellant contends that he raised a nonfrivolous allegation below that he had completed at least 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency. Specifically, the appellant alleges that his former position of Police Officer, AD-0083-07, Pentagon Force Protection Agency, is the same or similar position as his new position of Immigration Enforcement Agent, GL-1801-07, within the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that, in response to the administrative judge's show cause order on jurisdiction, the appellant submitted his declaration signed under penalty of perjury stating that both positions required him to carry a firearm and make arrests and that the duties for both jobs include apprehension, processing, and detention of either criminal suspects or illegal or criminal aliens. The declaration also states that the training for both positions was "extremely similar," that he had many of the same investigator courses and instructors for both trainings, and that there were only "minor differences" in the required training. The appellant also submitted copies of the position descriptions for both positions. In response, the agency submitted argument and documentary evidence on this issue, including SF-50s from the appellant's former position of Police Officer and the position description for his position of Immigration Enforcement Agent. In addition, the parties each submitted a second substantive brief addressing whether the appellant's current position of Immigration Enforcement Agent was the same or similar to that of his prior Police Officer position. For instance, the appellant's submission addressed the specific duties of the two positions as well as the law enforcement training he completed for each position, even to the extent of pointing out that the current position required a 5-week training course in Spanish. In this connection, the appellant specifically argued that, excluding the Spanish course, the training he received was virtually the same as the training he received for the Police Officer position. The agency disputed the appellant's assertions regarding the required training and duties and submitted a class catalog identifying the classes required for the Immigration Enforcement Agent position. Thus, the appellant and the agency have presented conflicting arguments concerning the duties and the training for the relevant positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the written record, we conclude that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the Police Officer and the Immigration Enforcement Agent positions are similar for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). While there are notable differences between the job descriptions, such as deportation of illegal aliens and Spanish speaking skills, our reviewing court has cautioned against placing too much emphasis on job description dissimilarities. <span class="Italic">See Coradeschi</span>, 439 F.3d 1334 (the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that Federal Air Marshal (FAM) position was similar to Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service (INS) Agent position, notwithstanding the fact that FAMs enforce criminal laws primarily in the confines of planes while INS agents enforce immigration laws primarily within business establishments); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 154 (2012) (the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that positions of Border Patrol Agent and Customs and Border Protection Officer were the same or similar). Rather, the Board should look to the skills and fundamental character of the position, which the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged are closely related. <span class="Italic">See Mueller v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 90-3467, 1993 WL 84948, *2 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (unpublished) (noting that both FAM and INS Agent positions required firearm proficiency and the ability to enforce laws and apprehend criminals); <span class="Italic">see also Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 235 (finding jobs of special delivery messenger and distribution clerk to be similar because the duties of both positions involved handling of mail). With regard to the agency's documentary evidence concerning the differing training requirements for the two positions, in light of the appellant's allegations, that evidence is not dispositive at this stage of the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329. We conclude, therefore, that the appellant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he may attempt to prove by preponderant evidence that the Police Officer and the Immigration Enforcement Agent positions are similar for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. <span class="Italic">See Coradaschi</span>, 439 F.3d at 1334.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Duties, not position descriptions, control the "line of work" analysis<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Gettings v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 502, 508 (1991) [<span class="Italic">Gettings</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-139.html#sec1-138">Veterans Readjustment Act</a>"] . <span class="Italic">Spillers v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 22, 26-28 (1994), suggested that although strong emphasis will be placed on position descriptions, other evidence of duties is material. The appeal involved a postmaster who held the job for a little less than a year prior to removal. He previously was a supervisor of customer services. The issue before the Board, as it remanded the case for further evidentiary development, was whether time in the prior position added to the time spent in the job held immediately before removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions may be deemed similar if they involve related or comparable work requiring the same or similar skills. The Board has interpreted the same line of work requirement for purposes of jurisdiction to mean that different positions are so similar that they require the same qualifications, they would have been in the same competitive level for reduction-in-force <span id="Page_94"></span>purposes, or they would allow an employee to interchange between the positions without significant training and without unduly interrupting the work program. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 18, 20 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 9 MSPR 380 (1982). While the Board has not ruled that in order for two positions to be the same or similar, they must be in the same competitive level, whether or not they would be is one factor that may be considered in making the determination. <span class="Italic">See Aizin v. Department of Defense</span>, 52 MSPR 146, 150 (1991); <span class="Italic">McDonald</span>, 42 MSPR at 152. In a closely analogous situation, determining completion of a probationary period, the Board has held that positions are in the same line of work if the experience gained in one demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shobe v. United States Postal Service</span>, 5 MSPR 466, 471 (1981). The agency argues essentially that the controlling factor in determining whether the jobs in question here were similar is the actual duties performed by the appellant in the two jobs rather than a comparison of the position descriptions of record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether jobs are similar, the Board generally does not probe behind the position descriptions of record, as that document is taken to be definitively reflective of the duties performed. <span class="Italic">See Van Skiver</span>, 7 MSPR at 20 n.1. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Simonton v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 30, 35 (1994) (whether positions are in the same competitive level for reduction-in-force purposes is determined mainly by the official position description even though other evidence may also be relevant in light of the circumstances). Moreover, <span class="Italic">Simonton</span> makes clear that the purpose for consideration of such other evidence is to "shed light on" the position descriptions rather than to be the controlling factor in making the determination<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, a question is raised regarding the nature and character of the duties performed, making reference to the position descriptions alone may be inadequate. <span class="Italic">See Van Skiver</span>, 7 MSPR at 20 n.1. Thus, under certain circumstances, the Board will consider all factors having bearing upon the totality of circumstances with respect to the duties performed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency argued below that with regard to whether the jobs in question were the same or similar, questions existed concerning the actual duties performed by the appellant in the two positions. For instance, the agency alleged that a customer service supervisor with no prior training on window duties and scheme distribution training and no prior financial training could not move into the postmaster position without undue disruption of the workplace and without significant training. As noted above, one consideration in making the determination of whether positions are in a similar line of work is whether an employee could interchange between the positions without significant training and without unduly interrupting the work program. <span class="Italic">See Van Skiver</span>, 7 MSPR at 20. The agency alleged further that there was a difference in the degree of supervisory duties, that the duties of the two positions were different in nature, and that without consideration of the actual duties, the administrative judge could not properly conclude that the positions were the same or similar. In this regard, the Board has held that two positions are not similar if several specified managerial functions are entailed by one position but not the other. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. United States Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 588, 591 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued in opposition to and submitted a sworn statement contradicting the agency's allegations that the two positions were not similar.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his jurisdictional Order, however, the administrative judge did not address the contradictions between the parties based on evidence regarding the actual duties of the positions but relied on the position descriptions to determine the jurisdictional issue. Although, as noted above, the Board has relied mainly on a comparison of position descriptions to determine whether positions are the same or similar, it has not found that position descriptions should be considered to the exclusion of all other evidence that may shed light on the position descriptions for determining whether positions are the same or similar. <span class="Italic">See Van Skiver</span>, 7 MSPR at 20 n.1; <span class="Italic">Simonton</span>, 62 MSPR at 35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' allegations raise factual issues that cannot be resolved based on consideration of only the position descriptions of record. The Board can make factual findings on the threshold issue of jurisdiction when such findings are based on undisputed documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. United States Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994). However, where, as here, the factual findings would have to be made on questions which are disputed by the parties and which are material to the jurisdictional issue, the appellant is entitled to jurisdictional hearing<span class="Italic">.
