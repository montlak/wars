<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-373"><span class="space">6.</span> Extension of Certification Year</h4>
<p class="noindent">A union's initial certification year, permitting it to bargain without challenge through a question concerning representation, may be extended if the employer obstructs and delays the bargaining process. FLRA employed that remedy in an egregious case, <span class="Italic">US Geological Survey, San Juan and AFGE Local 1503</span>, 53 FLRA 1006, 1015-1022 (1997), when a ULP was tied to a decertification petition. FLRA explained the reasons for extending the certification year, the law established by the NLRB, and the scope of the remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has never issued a remedial order in which the length of a union's certification year period has been extended as a result of an agency's misconduct. In the absence of specific precedent under the Statute, it is appropriate to look to private sector law for guidance. <span class="Italic">U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Geological Survey</span>, 50 FLRA at 550. It is now well-established that, as is the case here, "[w]hen there are comparable provisions under the Statute and the NLRA [National Labor Relations Act], decisions of the NLRB [National Labor Relations Board] and the courts interpreting the NLRA have a high degree of relevance to similar circumstances under the Statute." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Solicitor</span>, <span class="Italic">Arlington Field Office</span>, 37 FLRA 1371, 1381 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the private sector, one of the purposes of section 9(c)(3) of the NLRA, which bars a representation petition filed within 12 months from the date of the last election, is to ensure the parties a reasonable period of time in which to bargain without outside interference or pressure. In accordance with this purpose, the NLRB (Board) has adopted a rule requiring that a certification, based on a Board-conducted election, must be honored for a period of 1 year, in the absence of unusual circumstances. <span class="Italic">Kimberly-Clark</span> <span class="Italic">Corporation</span>, 61 NLRB 90 (1945). This rule, which was approved by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Ray Brooks v. NLRB</span>, 348 U.S. 96 (1954) (<span class="Italic">Brooks</span>), was adopted in an effort to give a certified union "ample time for carrying out its mandate" and, accordingly, stabilize industrial relations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 100. As the <span class="Italic">Brooks</span> Court specifically explained, "[i]t is scarcely conducive to bargaining in good faith for an employer to know that, if he dillydallies or subtly undermines, union strength may erode and thereby relieve him of his statutory duties at any time[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The presumption of the union's continuing majority status during the one year period following its certification is "almost conclusive." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Burns International Security</span> <span class="Italic">Services, Inc.</span>, 406 U.S. 272, 279 n.3 (1972). For example, in <span class="Italic">Brooks</span>, the Court affirmed the Board's determination that an employer must recognize and bargain with a union for the entire "certification year" even if it has objective evidence that the union has lost its majority status. <span class="Italic">See also NLRB v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co.</span>, 613 F.2d 267, 272 (10th Cir. 1980) (company's belief that the union no longer represented a majority of the employees was irrelevant in view of the almost conclusive presumption of the union's majority representation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, in <span class="Italic">Mar-Jac Poultry Company, Inc.</span>, 136 NLRB 785 (1962) (<span class="Italic">Mar-Jac</span>), the Board modified this rule and concluded that it would extend the presumption of the union's majority status beyond one year where an <span id="page_1646"></span>employer's misconduct serves to deprive the union of a full year of actual bargaining. In <span class="Italic">Mar-Jac</span>, shortly after the Union's certification, the company was sold to a successor employer. When the employer was thereafter requested to bargain, it filed a decertification petition and refused to negotiate. The Union then filed an unfair labor practice charge. Ultimately, the employer entered into a settlement agreement wherein it agreed to bargain in good faith but, after making substantial progress toward a collective bargaining agreement, refused to complete negotiations. To remedy the employer's unlawful conduct, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to grant the union an additional period of "at least 1 year of actual bargaining from the date of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 787. According to the Board, such a remedy was necessary because, "[the employer] ha[d], largely through its refusal to bargain, taken from the Union a substantial part of the period when Unions are generally at their greatest strength--the 1-year period immediately following the certification<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. In the Board's view, to permit the employer to obtain an election in such circumstances "would [have been] to allow it to take advantage of its own failure to carry out its statutory obligation, contrary to the very reasons for the establishment of the rule that a certification requires bargaining for at least 1 year<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Other private sector cases discussed below, such as <span class="Italic">Colfor, Inc</span>., 282 NLRB 1173, 1175 (1987), <span class="Italic">enfd</span>. 838 F.2d 164 (6th Cir. 1988), and <span class="Italic">Glomac Plastics, Inc.</span>, 234 NLRB 1309, 1311 (1978), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, 592 F.2d 94 (2d Cir. 1979), also make clear that a persistent pattern of bargaining violations, such as that present in the instant case, is a situation wherein the Board will consider the remedy of extending the certification year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In extending the length of time a union should be free from challenge to its certification, the duration of the bargaining order must be determined. It is the Board's general rule to grant an extension for a period that provides the aggrieved party with a full year of actual bargaining<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Colfor, Inc</span>., 282 NLRB 1173, 1175 (1987), <span class="Italic">enfd</span>. 838 F.2d 164 (6th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Colfor); Mar-Jac</span>, 136 NLRB at 787. However, the Board does recognize that there are exceptions to this rule and, in this regard, has asserted that a certification year extension "need not be the product of a simple arithmetic calculation." <span class="Italic">Glomac Plastics, Inc.</span>, 234 NLRB 1309 (1978), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, 592 F.2d 94 (2d Cir. 1979) (<span class="Italic">Glomac Plastics</span>). Rather, in addition to considering the amount of time remaining in the certification year, the Board, in fashioning a remedy, takes into account any additional time that may be necessary to "resurrect the bargaining process" that was unlawfully disrupted by the employer. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. National Medical Hospital of Compton</span>, 907 F.2d 905, 910-911 (9th Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Compton</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in <span class="Italic">Glomac Plastics</span>, the Board held that although the employer had engaged in 9 1/2 months of bargaining during the certification year, the evidence indicated that such bargaining had been in bad faith in the hope that a successful decertification petition would be filed at the end of the certification year. In concluding that it was necessary to extend the certification year by another 12 months in order to remedy the effects of the employer's unlawful conduct, the Board stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Although the so-called <span class="Italic">Mar-Jac</span> remedy (136 NLRB 785, 787 (1962)) is typically designed to provide an aggrieved labor organization with 1 year's time in which to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement, we do not believe the Board is powerless to order, under proper circumstances, a complete renewal of a certification year, even in cases where there has been good-faith bargaining in the prior certification year. Such a position takes cognizance not only of the realities of collective-bargaining negotiations as well as the realities of the effect of any bad-faith bargaining in the prior year, but also, more importantly, of that policy embedded in the Act which seeks to have the relationship between covered employees and their employers determined by the bargaining process and then reduced to written contract form.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1309 n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Colfor</span>, 282 NLRB at 1175, the Board granted an extension of the certification year that included additional time to resurrect the bargaining process. In that case the Board held, with judicial approval, that although the employer had engaged in 10 months of bargaining during the certification year, its two refusals to bargain "had a greater impact on the bargaining relationship than merely denying the [u]nion two months of bargaining<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The Board, therefore, concluded that a 6-month extension of the certification year was appropriate in order to remedy the effects of the employer's disruptions of negotiations. <span class="Italic">See also Haymarket</span> <span class="Italic">Bookbinders, Inc.</span>, 183 NLRB 121 (1970) (although the parties bargained throughout the course of the entire certification year, the Board extended the union's certification for an additional 6 months in order to remedy various unfair labor practices through which the employer had attempted to undermine union support and which deprived the union of its full representative status).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As concerns a union's delay in seeking negotiations during the certification year, the Board has found that in the absence of "significant delay in the commencement of bargaining attributable to inexcusable procrastination or other manifestations of bad faith on the part of the bargaining representative[,]" an extension of the certification year will be measured as commencing on the date of the parties' first bargaining session. <span class="Italic">Compton</span>, 287 NLRB at 150. This position is consistent with its view that parties should be given a reasonable time, ordinarily one year, within which to bargain without outside interference or pressure. <span class="Italic">See also Airport-Shuttle Cincinnati, Inc.</span>, 257 NLRB 955 (1981), <span class="Italic">enfd</span>. 703 F.2d 220 (6th Cir. 1983) (extending certification for an entire year even though the union had failed to pursue negotiations with the employer for 7 months, during which time it was completely inactive).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we understand the Board precedent discussed above to establish that if an employer engages in bad-faith bargaining for a substantial portion of a union's certification year, the Board will extend the certification for a full year. On the other hand, if an employer engages in bad-faith bargaining for only a brief portion of the certification year, the union's certification will be extended for a period of less than a year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Federal sector, section 7111(f)(4) of the Statute is substantially similar to section 9(c)(3) of the NLRA. In view of the similarity of the law in both sectors, we find it appropriate to use private sector precedent as a guide in fashioning a Federal sector remedy for an agency's failure to carry out its obligation to bargain during the 1-year period immediately following a union's certification. More particularly in this regard, no reason has been advanced by the Respondent for not adopting in the Federal sector the reasons advanced in the private sector, such as promoting stable labor relations, for extending the certification year in a case such as this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, upon a union's certification, an agency is required to honor that certification for a period of 1 year without engaging in conduct that undermines the union's status as exclusive representative. As the Board and the courts have recognized, this provides the parties with a reasonable period of time within which to bargain without outside interference or pressure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the so-called "certification year," an agency is obligated to recognize and bargain with the union and a failure to do so will constitute an unfair labor practice. To remedy such unlawful conduct we will order the agency to bargain with the union. When the agency's misconduct is egregious such that the agency engages in bad-faith bargaining for a substantial portion of a union's certification year, we will extend the certification for a full year. If, however, an agency engages in bad-faith bargaining for only a brief portion of the certification year, the union's certification will be extended for a period of less than a year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case, we find that the Respondent's misconduct was sufficiently egregious and pervasive throughout the certification year as to warrant a complete renewal of the Union's certification year....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the foregoing evidence reflects, the Respondent's unlawful conduct, which commenced only 1 month and 5 days after the Union's certification and ran through much of the certification year, directly affected the Union and insured that the process of bargaining for an initial collective bargaining agreement never had an opportunity to get seriously and fairly underway. Moreover, in the circumstances here presented, it is unreasonable to conclude that these parties could resume negotiations at the point where they were suspended over three years ago or that fruitful negotiations for a complete bargaining agreement could transpire during the time remaining in the Union's initial certification year. Indeed, as the facts of this case clearly demonstrate, the parties required the assistance of a Federal mediator and a period of almost two months simply to negotiate a ground rules agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in light of the national labor policy which seeks to have disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment settled amicably through collective bargaining, we findy it appropriate to extend the Union's certification for a 1-year period beginning on the date that bargaining is commenced. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Glomac</span> <span class="Italic">Plastics</span>, 234 NLRB 1309 n.4.; <span class="Italic">Lustrelon, Inc.</span>, 289 NLRB 378, 379 (1988). We adopt the private sector rule, of using commencement of bargaining as the beginning of the extended certification year, rather than the date of the remedial order issued today, because it best ensures that the union will have the full year-long opportunity contemplated by the Statute to negotiate on conditions of employment for unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of this determination, we further conclude that the decertification petition filed in Case No. AT-DR-40094 should be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See Mar-Jac Poultry</span>, 136 NLRB 785 (dismissing decertification petition filed more than a year after the union's certification on the ground that the union was entitled to "at least 1 year of actual bargaining from the date of the settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">see also Big Three</span> <span class="Italic">Industries, Inc.</span>, 201 NLRB 197 (1973) (affirming dismissal of decertification petition where the union was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative and a <span id="page_1647"></span>subsequent complaint alleged that during the 1-year certification period the employer violated the Act by engaging in bad faith bargaining with the union).</p>
