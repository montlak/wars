<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-75"><span class="space">b.</span> Position Must Be Upgraded</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"[T]he Board may exercise its jurisdiction in a constructive demotion appeal only when a position has actually been reclassified upward and an employee claims entitlement to a noncompetitive promotion to the higher-graded position; a constructive demotion appeal does not lie based on a claim that a position could have been or should have been reclassified upward." <span class="Italic">Marcheggiani v. DOD</span>, 90 MSPR 212, 216-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2001) ("[H]owever else a dispute might be characterized, it cannot be considered in the guise of a 'constructive demotion' claim when there has been no upward reclassification of a position[.]"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 104 MSPR 229, 232 &#x00B6; 5, 2006 MSPB 352 (2006) ("Taking as true the appellant's claims that he performed GS-13 duties while on duty in Saudi Arabia, and that the agency subsequently failed to document or compensate him for his performance of those duties, it still does not appear that he was subjected to a constructive demotion or any other action within the Board's jurisdiction. An employee is deemed to have suffered a constructive demotion only where he was reassigned from a position which, due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of a classification error, was worth a higher grade; the employee met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade; and he was permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which he would otherwise have been promoted."). Under <span class="Italic">Marcheggiani</span>, a claim to a career ladder promotion does not assert a constructive demotion claim, but the appellant may have an appeal from an actual reduction in grade or RIF demotion if the real claim is that the appellant actually held a higher-level position and was reassigned to a lower-level position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no constructive demotion appeal if the position vacated by the appellant is never actually upgraded, even though a classification analysis suggests that it should be upgraded. <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 81 MSPR 252 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (partially overruled in <span class="Italic">Manlogon v. EPA</span>, 87 MSPR 653 (2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>, as to the significance of the timing of the reclassification), noted that a <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal is not made out, as was implied in <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 35, 39 (1996), on the basis that a position should have been (but was not in fact) reclassified. Under <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>, 81 MSPR at 255-56 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[W]here an employee is reassigned from a position which due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error is worth a higher grade, the employee meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade, and where the employee who held that position is permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which the employee would otherwise be promoted, then the employee is reduced in grade." <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 585, 6 MSPR 698, 711 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Department of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court quoted approvingly from <span class="Italic">Russell</span> when it agreed that "where an employee is reassigned from a position which due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error is worth a higher grade," the employee may have grounds for a constructive demotion appeal. This statement suggests that the Board and the court would find jurisdiction in cases in which a new classification standard <span class="Italic">had been</span> applied or a classification error <span class="Italic">had been</span> corrected, not necessarily in cases in which the agency <span class="Italic">could have</span> corrected a classification error or applied a new classification standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although our restatement of this principle in subsequent cases might suggest that we would have jurisdiction in situations in which the former position was misclassified or "should have been" upgraded, <span class="Italic">see Bittner v. National Credit Union Administration</span>, 76 MSPR 380, 383 (1997); <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 35, 38 (1996), that interpretation does not necessarily flow from <span class="Italic">Russell or</span> <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>. Indeed, the agencies in both of those cases took some classification action <span class="Italic">subsequent</span> to the reassignment that suggested that the appellant's position had been improperly graded at the time of reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Bittner</span> 76 MSPR at 383-84 (following the appellant's reassignment, the agency established <span id="Page_2047"></span>a new higher-graded position with the same duties as the position the appellant had occupied before her reassignment); <span class="Italic">Pritchett,</span> 72 MSPR at 38-39 (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court has held that since the Board created the concept of "constructive demotion," the Board also has "considerable discretion to define the perimeters of the concept." <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1123. Accordingly, we hereby clarify that the Board will exercise its jurisdiction to hear appeals as constructive demotions <span class="Italic">only</span> in situations in which the agency or the Office of Personnel Management takes a classification action that is either a correction of a classification action or an application of a new classification standard <span class="Italic">subsequent</span> to the appellant's reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the following facts are undisputed: In September 1993, the agency converted the appellant, who was a Non-Appropriated Fund employee, from the position of Maintenance Worker, NA-5, to an Appropriated Fund position as Maintenance Worker, WG-8 in the Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Department. On June 6, 1996, the Director of MWR filed an "Advisory Classification" requesting an advisory opinion as to whether the appellant's WG-8 position should have been classified as a WG-10 position. On June 18, 1996, a classification advisory opinion was issued, recommending that the appellant's position be reclassified as a WG-10 position. Consequently, the appellant requested and received back pay for the difference in pay between a WG-8 and WG-10 position for the previous 2 years. The appellant's position, however, was not then, and has never been, officially reclassified at the WG-10 level. After the classification advisory opinion was issued in June 1996, he was instructed by Roy Fricke, the MWR Director, to discontinue performing duties above his grade level. The appellant, however, continued to perform the duties of a WG-10, but only received WG-8 pay. On March 18, 1997, he filed a classification appeal with the agency requesting that his position be reclassified as a WG-10 position. Ten days later, he was involuntarily reassigned to the WG-8 position of Electrical Worker in the Public Works Department, effective April 13, 1997. After this reassignment, his former WG-8 Maintenance Worker position was abolished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, it is undisputed that the agency has not taken any classification action subsequent to the appellant's reassignment. In fact, the agency abolished the appellant's former position simultaneously with his reassignment to another position. In the absence of any subsequent classification action, we decline to exercise our jurisdiction to hear the appellant's constructive demotion claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board on review, determining in <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1364-66 (Fed. Cir. 2000), that the Board has jurisdiction only if the agency upgraded the petitioner's prior position to correct a classification error rather than to create a higher-graded position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 gives the Board jurisdiction over "reduction in grade" and "reduction in pay" cases. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(3) and (4) (1994). The Board has also assumed jurisdiction</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[w]here an employee is reassigned from a position which due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error is worth a higher grade, the employee meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade, and where the employee who held that position is permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which the employee would otherwise be promoted, then the employee is reduced in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 585, 6 MSPR 698, 711 (1981). The Board has characterized cases governed by this strictly defined and narrow situation as "constructive demotion" cases. The Board has further clarified that these cases arise when an agency reassigns an employee out of a position that is subsequently upgraded and the employee met the requirements for promotion at the time of the reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Spicer v. Department of Defense,</span> 59 MSPR 359, 362, 367 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, while a "constructive demotion" is not actually a reduction in grade or pay, it has been treated as such by the Board for purposes of establishing its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Russell,</span> 6 MSPB 585, 6 MSPR at 711. This court has never explicitly sanctioned the doctrine of constructive demotion by reversing a Board determination that a party had not been constructively demoted. In this ease, Mr. Hogan's claim does not contain the elements of constructive demotion as specified by the Board in <span class="Italic">Russell.</span> Therefore, we need not decide here whether that doctrine is ever a valid basis of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because this court has acknowledged the concept of "classification error" as a precursor of one type of potential constructive demotion, however, it is appropriate to address further the concept of "constructive demotion." This court has stated in this regard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he determination whether there had been a classification error was to be made with respect to the grade at which the position most recently had been classified, and that a classification error could <span class="Italic">not</span> be established by showing that, because of an increase in duties, the position <span class="Italic">should have been</span> upgraded through reclassification prior to the employee's reassignment. This narrow scope of "classification error" accords with and furthers the congressional policy reflected in the Reform Act to "increase the flexibility of agencies to assign employees to positions and duties where they are needed without having to take an adverse action against an employee when the job title or duties have changed, but the grade has not." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 49-50 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2723, 2771-72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Artmann v. Department of Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court's original statement in <span class="Italic">Artmann</span> of the elements of constructive demotion was clear: A new classification standard must <span class="Italic">have</span> been already issued, or a classification error must <span class="Italic">have been</span> already corrected, and the other requirements met, in order for an action for constructive demotion to arise, and for the Board to have jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1123. However, the concept of "constructive demotion" has assumed a certain fluidity. When this court in <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Navy,</span> 106 F.3d 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1997), alluded to constructive demotion, it stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By meeting these requirements, the employee demonstrates that the previous position <span class="Italic">should have been</span> classified at a grade or pay higher than that of the position to which the employee was reassigned; thus, the reassignment constituted a "constructive" demotion. <span class="Italic">See Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1123.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Walker,</span> 106 F.3d at 1584 (emphasis added). This statement appears to expand the constructive demotion doctrine beyond cases in which the petitioner's prior position <span class="Italic">was</span> reclassified by the agency, to include those where the petitioner's prior position was not reclassified, but petitioner argues that it should have been. Mr. Hogan here pleads that he was constructively demoted because his previous position <span class="Italic">should have been</span> reclassified upward, even though the Navy has not undertaken any actual reclassification. Thus, this court undertakes to review the cases relevant to this question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> petitioner's original position was as a Supervisory Employee Development Specialist, GS-11. In January, his agency reassigned him to the GS-11 position of Employee Development Specialist. In June, his employing agency established the GS-12 position of Supervisory Employee Development Specialist. The agency then filled this new position through competitive promotion procedures, resulting in the selection of a candidate other than the petitioner. <span class="Italic">See Russell,</span> 6 MSPB 585, 6 MSPR at 701. The Board acknowledged that the agency might have constructively demoted the petitioner. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 711. The Board defined a narrow category of constructive demotion (which required an actual reclassification of the petitioner's prior position) and remanded. This court did not review the <span class="Italic">Russell</span> decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, petitioner occupied a position classified at grade GM-13. After a major reorganization, his employing agency substituted a new position at grade GM-14 for the petitioner's original position. The agency invited applicants for the new position. The petitioner applied, but was not selected. The agency then reassigned the petitioner to a GS-13 position at the same pay as his former GM-13 position. The petitioner argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency had erroneously classified his original position at grade GM-13, either because its original classification at that grade was improper or because, as a result of an increase in his duties, the agency should have reclassified the position to grade GM-14 before the reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1121. The Board found that petitioner had not shown that a classification error occurred when his position was last classified by a person with classification authority. Therefore, petitioner had shown no classification error. The Board further reasoned that the agency "upgraded [Artmann's prior position] due to the addition of duties and as a result of a reorganization...<span class="Italic">not because of a reclassification error</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 926 F.2d at 1122 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Board found no constructive demotion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court upheld the Board's finding that no classification error occurred and that petitioner's reassignment to the GM-13 position did not constitute a constructive demotion. <span class="Italic">See Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1125. Read together, <span class="Italic">Artmann</span> and <span class="Italic">Russell</span> indicate that the Board's definition of constructive demotion comprises only instances where a position has been upgraded to correct an error, not those in which an agency has added new duties to the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, petitioner was a GS-4 Navy police officer who became disabled and incapable of performing his duties. The agency offered petitioner a position as a GS-4 Mail and File Clerk. Plaintiff declined this offer. <span class="Italic">See Walker,</span> 106 F.3d at 1583. The Navy then reassigned him from his position as GS-4 police officer to the comparable pay, grade, and step position of GS-4 police officer dispatcher. On the same day, the agency promoted GS-4 Police Officers within petitioner's former division to the position of GS-5 Police Officer, as a result of a change in the classification for that position. Plaintiff appealed, arguing that his reassignment denied him a promotion and thus constructively demoted him. Plaintiff, however, <span id="Page_2048"></span>could not prove that he met the physical qualification requirements for the position of Police Officer, the second <span class="Italic">Russell</span> requirement, and the Board dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1584. On appeal, this court did not consider jurisdiction but held that petitioner had not presented any evidence on the issue of his physical qualification. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1585. Although <span class="Italic">Walker</span> was, like <span class="Italic">Artmann</span> and <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> a case in which petitioner's position had in fact been reclassified, petitioner had not satisfied all the requirements for constructive demotion. Specifically, this court found no constructive demotion because petitioner could not satisfy the "qualification requirement." Thus, the observation in <span class="Italic">Walker</span> that "the previous position should have been classified at a grade or pay higher" was not an expansion of the scope of constructive demotion but merely a shorthand characterization unnecessary to the resolution of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, this case is susceptible to very simple reasoning. The agency abolished Mr. Hogan's original WG-8 position. The agency did not reclassify Mr. Hogan's position. Long before it reviewed the Board's findings in <span class="Italic">Artmann</span> and <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, this court noted that the Board and this court have no jurisdiction to review or revise an agency's job classification. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The same constraint applies to reclassifications. Therefore, only if the agency itself has actually upgraded the petitioner's prior position to correct an error, as distinct from creating an upgrade position, could the reassignment possibly be deemed a "constructive demotion." Thus, because there was no agency corrective reclassification, the Board is correct that it lacked jurisdiction to review this putative action for constructive demotion.</p>

Rather, the appellant claims the position was misclassified because he was performing the GS-15 duties in 2009. Because the appellant only disputes whether the position should have been updated at a later date and not when the position originally became effective, the appellant has not shown that the upgrading was due to a classification error," <span class="Italic">relying on</span> <span class="Italic">Artmann v.

<p class="Body-Text">It is immaterial whether the position is upgraded subsequent to the employee's reassignment out of the position, <span class="Italic">Manlogon v. EPA</span>, 87 MSPR 653, 656-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (2001), partially overruling <span class="Italic">Hogan,</span> 81 MSPR 252 (1999), <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board first addressed the concept of a constructive demotion in <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 698 (1981). There, the Board held that an employee would be deemed to have suffered a reduction in grade where he was reassigned from a position which, due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error, was worth a higher grade; the employee met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade; and the employee who held that position was permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which the employee would otherwise have been promoted<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 711. The theory was that, in that situation, the employee was entitled to a noncompetitive promotion prior to his reassignment, and that, therefore, his reassignment from that position was effectively a demotion. In <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Department of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit approved, as a reasonable implementation of the Board's broad authority to interpret and apply the statutory provisions it administers, its interpretation of the term "reduction in grade" as including the concept of constructive demotion set forth in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since that time, however, some of the Board's decisions have strayed from the clear jurisdictional requirement of <span class="Italic">Russell</span> and <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, suggesting that the Board would have jurisdiction in situations not only where the employee's former position was misclassified, but also where it "should have been" upgraded<span class="Italic">. See Bittner v. National Credit Union Administration</span>, 76 MSPR 380, 383 (1997); <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 35, 38 (1996). The Board itself recognized this inconsistency in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>. 81 MSPR 252 &#x00B6; 7. In view of this confusion, we believe that this case presents an opportunity for the Board to clarify this area of the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin by examining <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>. There, following a recommendation that his position should be classified at a higher grade, the appellant claimed entitlement to it under a constructive demotion theory. The Board found no jurisdiction on the basis that the agency abolished the appellant's former position simultaneously with his reassignment, and thus never took any classification action subsequent to the appellant's reassignment<span class="Italic">. Hogan</span>, 81 MSPR 252 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. In affirming the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>, however, the court did not rely on the "subsequent to" language, but rather concluded that a constructive demotion requires an agency reclassification action, and that there was no such action in the fact pattern presented in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>. <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>, 218 F.3d at 1366. In fact, the language in the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span> that states that the reclassification action must have occurred "subsequent to" the employee's reassignment is not consistent with <span class="Italic">Russell</span> and <span class="Italic">Artmann</span> inasmuch as no such requirement is reflected in those decisions. More important, as the appellant argues persuasively in his PFR, the requirement is arbitrary, and no sound basis exists for mandating a particular sequence of events, so long as the basic elements of a constructive demotion, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, are met. Accordingly, the Board hereby overrules the "subsequent to" requirement as set out in our decision in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the Board's "subsequent to" language in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span> was really aimed at another problem, that is, the Board's recognition that it had incorrectly expanded the constructive demotion doctrine by providing that an appellant could establish a constructive demotion by proving that the agency "should have reclassified" his position, even where the agency had not actually reclassified it<span class="Italic">. Hogan</span>, 81 MSPR 252 &#x00B6; 7, citing <span class="Italic">Bittner</span> and <span class="Italic">Pritchett</span>. In affirming <span class="Italic">Hogan</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit agreed that an employee's argument that his position "should have been reclassified" does not give rise to a constructive demotion claim<span class="Italic">. See Hogan</span>, 218 F.3d at 1365-66. Relying on <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985), for the proposition that neither the Board nor the court has jurisdiction to review or revise an agency's job classification, the court in <span class="Italic">Hogan</span> found that the same constraint applies to reclassifications, and held that, if the agency has not actually upgraded the employee's position, no claim for a constructive demotion will lie<span class="Italic">. See Hogan</span>, 218 F.3d at 1366. In light of the court's analysis, it also is apparent that the <span class="Italic">Bittner</span> line of cases is no longer good law, and we therefore overrule <span class="Italic">Bittner</span> and its progeny.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to an application of the law, as we have clarified it, to this case. Here, the agency did classify the position to which the appellant claims entitlement, even though the actual date of the classification action, September 25, 1995, was 4 days prior to his reassignment. Nonetheless, the position remained classified at the GS-14 level well after the appellant's reassignment, until June 6, 1999, when the agency, having determined not to fill the position, abolished it. The fact that the agency never filled the GS-14 position and abolished it several years later does not defeat the appellant's claim to the position during the time period it was classified at that level because a classification action becomes effective when a person with properly delegated authority signs the cover sheet of the position description, certifying that the position has been properly classified<span class="Italic">. See Artmann</span>, 926 F.2d at 1124.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that an appellant who makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing<span class="Italic">. See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994). We find that the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, i.e., he asserted that his GM-13 position was upgraded, without a significant change in duties or responsibilities, at the time he was reassigned to another position, and that he met the qualifications for promotion to that position<span class="Italic">. See Burrell v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 81 MSPR 427 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17 (1999) (employee raised a nonfrivolous allegation of constructive demotion, warranting a jurisdictional hearing, where he asserted that his GM-13 position was upgraded to GS-14, without a significant change in duties and responsibilities, 4 days before he was reassigned to a GS-13 position). We conclude, therefore, that this appeal must be remanded for a jurisdictional hearing. In order to prevail, however, the appellant must establish that, at the time of his reassignment, his former GM-13 position was reclassified at the GS-14 level to correct an error in the original classification or because a new classification standard was issued (rather than because of the addition of duties and responsibilities through a planned management action), and that he, in fact, met the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the upgraded GS-14 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant is detailed rather than permanently reassigned out of his original job, the <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal does not succeed because the appellant has not been reassigned from his original job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beaudette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 100 MSPR 353, 359-60 &#x00B6; 13 (2005). But, under <span class="Italic">Beudette, supra,</span> if the appellant is reassigned to another position and other, like positions held prior to the reassignment were upgraded, <span class="Italic">Russell</span> may provide the basis for a claim, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 360 &#x00B6; 14:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Unlike the appellant's constructive demotion claim discussed above, his claim that he was constructively demoted in April 2003 is one over which the Board may have jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ellis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 102, 105-07 (1997) (remanding for a jurisdictional hearing where the appellant alleged that all of the GS-5 Supply Technician <span id="Page_2049"></span>positions were upgraded, without a significant change in duties and responsibilities, after she was assigned to another GS-5 position); <span class="Italic">Spicer v. Department of Defense</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 359, 363-68 (1993) (the Board found a constructive demotion where the evidence showed that there were no significant, grade-controlling differences between the duties and responsibilities of the positions in question); <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Department of Transportation</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 190, 191-92 (1985) (where the appellant raised specific and detailed factual allegations in his constructive demotion appeal claiming that the GS-12 Staff Engineer position he had encumbered for 3 years was virtually identical to a GS-13 Staff Engineer position and that the agency changed the title of his former position and assigned another employee to fill the GS-13 position, the Board found that he should have been afforded his requested jurisdictional hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assignment through temporary promotion to a higher-graded job and then return to the earlier and permanent position does not qualify as a constructive demotion, even if the appellant asserts that when the temporary promotion ended the appellant continued to perform higher-graded duties, <span class="Italic">Salazar v. DHS,</span> DC-3443-10-0360-I-1 (NP 10/18/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reasserts on review that, because he had served more than 120 days in the temporary promotion to the GS-14 Acting Watch Commander position, he was permanently promoted to that position. Specifically, the appellant asserts that "[p]ursuant to 5 CFR Part 335, a temporary promotion to a higher grade becomes permanent if the employee remains in that position for more than 120 days." However, nothing in the cited regulatory provision supports the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the facts of this case are similar to the facts in <span class="Italic">Deida v. Department of the Navy,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 408 (2009). However, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Deida</span> had applied for a permanent position through an open vacancy announcement. <span class="Italic">Deida,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 2. The appellant in this case was simply given a non-competitive temporary promotion. "As in the case of an employee serving a limited term appointment, the termination of a temporary promotion is not an adverse action covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the Board." <span class="Italic">Winn v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 157, 159 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Boswell v. Department of the Army</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 521, 522-24 (1989); <span class="Italic">Mosley v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 689, 690-91 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that, while his promotion to the GS-14 position was intended to be temporary, upon his return to his GS-13 position he has been required to continue to perform the Watch Commander duties he performed while temporarily promoted to Acting Watch Commander and, thus, he was returned "to his prior GS-13 position in name only." Although the appellant implicitly asserts that he has remained in the GS-14 position from a duties standpoint, while reduced in grade from a pay standpoint, his actual claim, in effect, is that the agency has improperly failed to reclassify his GS-13 position to the GS-14 level due to the alleged addition of the Watch Commander position duties. The Board does not have jurisdiction over claims that a position has been incorrectly classified. <span class="Italic">See Beaudette v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 12 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is deemed to have been subjected to an appealable "constructive demotion" when he is reassigned from a position that is reclassified upward due to the issuance of a new classification standard or correction of a classification error, provided that the employee meets the legal and qualification requirements for the higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">See Marcheggiani v. Department of Defense</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2001); <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 711 (1981). A constructive demotion claim is not viable when it is based on an allegation that the position from which the appellant was reassigned could have been or should have been reclassified upward; rather, a constructive demotion claim can succeed only if the appellant's former position "has actually been reclassified upward." <span class="Italic">Marcheggiani</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 8. The administrative judge informed the appellant in the order to show cause of what he would need to prove to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an assertion that he had been constructively demoted. In the instant case, neither of the positions the appellant has served in have been reclassified upward, and therefore the appellant has not alleged a constructive demotion within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
