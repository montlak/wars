<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-78"><span class="space">a.</span> When Disability Claim or Defense Must Be Raised</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">When must an agency become aware of the disability to incur accommodative responsibility? There is no fixed point, but the disability should be made known to or be apparent to the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hooks v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 431, 438 (1989) ("[A]lthough agency officials were aware that the appellant had suffered a nervous breakdown in 1983 and 1984, the evidence does not show that they should have connected this with the appellant's current behavior"; a psychiatrist testified that the average layman would not perceive that the appellant was ill). The agency is obligated to offer rehabilitative assistance to an employee if it is aware of the employee's problem before the effective date of the removal. <span class="Italic">Berry v. VA</span>, 25 MSPR 50, 52 (1984) (employee with emotional problems requested admittance to an employee assistance program prior to his removal for AWOL).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a disability defense may be raised during the defense of an adverse action, a request for accommodation is prospective. An agency does not have a duty retroactively to excuse poor performance based on a subsequent accommodation request as to a previously unknown disability, <span class="Italic">Mosley v. Dept. of Transp</span>., AT-0752-14-0666-I-1 (NP 12/3/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove a failure to accommodate disability discrimination claim, an appellant must prove that he is a disabled person, that the action appealed was based on his disability and, to the extent possible, he must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant funded position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 16 (2010). However, reasonable accommodation is always prospective; an agency does not have a duty to retroactively excuse poor performance based upon a subsequent request to accommodate a previously unknown disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5) (defining illegal disability discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act (ADAAA) to include failing to reasonably accommodate "known physical or mental limitations"); <span class="Italic">Purcell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970773, 1999 WL 448126, at *1-*2 (June 24, 1999) (finding that an agency was not required to accommodate an employee or retroactively excuse her poor performance based on a request for accommodation she made after receiving the performance appraisal at issue); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant did not inform the agency of his medical conditions or seek reasonable accommodation until after H.B. suspended his training, the TRB recommended terminating his training, and B.L. proposed terminating his training, all of which resulted from the appellant's poor performance. Therefore, as the administrative judge properly noted, the appellant's reasonable accommodation request did not obligate the agency to excuse his prior failures. <span class="Italic">See Purcell</span>, 1999 WL 448126, at *2.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-21-0069-I-1 (NP 3/29/2022) ("A reasonable accommodation request must place the agency on notice of the appellant's need for assistance with his disability. <span class="Italic">Patton</span>, 874 F.3d at 444. Thus, a reasonable accommodation must always be prospective because, otherwise, sufficient notice of such need is not given to the agency. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5) (defining illegal disability discrimination to include failing to reasonable accommodate "known physical or mental limitations"); <span class="Italic">Clawson-Cano v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120121727, 2012 WL 3614534, at *5 (Aug. 17, 2012) (stating that reasonable accommodation requests are prospective in nature and do not form a basis for excusing past behavior even if the alleged disability caused the misconduct).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Terry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 565, 570 (1989), emphasized that an agency must be attentive to an employee's efforts to call attention to a disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found that the appellant gave the agency timely notice of her claim of a drug abuse handicap, he found that she had failed to show that the agency knew or should have known that she was handicapped by drug abuse. He based this finding on her repeated denials that she had a drug abuse problem, on her satisfactory performance, and on the lack of any indication of drug abuse. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record establishes that, when she made her oral reply to the agency's charges, she presented the agency with a report...that she was receiving treatment in its Stimulant User's Support Group. We find that, if the appellant had claimed drug dependency, evidence such as this report would have been sufficient to corroborate her claim before the agency. An agency may not simply choose not to believe an employee who has attempted to verify a claim of handicapping condition based on alcohol or drug dependency. All that an agency needs to have is a <span class="Italic">reasonable suspicion</span> of alcohol or drug abuse before its duty to accommodate arises. The appellant need not prove addiction to a certainty to the agency before the agency's obligation to accommodate arises. Here, if there was a question of dependency because of the appellant's denials, the agency should have either requested additional information from the appellant or attempted to verify the appellant's condition on its own. We note that an employee's denial of addiction can itself be a symptom of alcohol or drug dependency. Since the agency did not offer the appellant accommodation, it took the risk that the appellant would prove her claim of handicap discrimination on appeal to the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sublette v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 82, 88 (1995), reconfirmed that the agency must consider information pertaining to an appellant's disability when that information is supplied before the agency's final decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to assume that the appellant showed that he has a disability, he has nevertheless failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination. As part of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the appellant must show that the agency knew about his disability at the time of the adverse action, <span class="Italic">and</span> that the action appealed to the Board was based on his disability. Since the agency learned of the appellant's purported impairment/disability after it proposed his removal, but before a final agency decision was rendered, it did have knowledge of the alleged disability. However, the appellant has not shown that the removal was based on his alleged disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Battle v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 403, 408 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 276, 280-82 (1991), although the agency was on notice of appellant's physical restrictions and necessary accommodation by the time of the oral reply to the proposed adverse action based on appellant's alleged physical inability to perform his duties as a painter, it was not until the last phase of the appeal that the appellant specifically argued reasonable accommodation. The Board decided that the appellant's articulation at the last moment of that accommodation was sufficient to preserve the issue for Board adjudication when, before the hearing, the agency knew of the necessity for accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In his written closing argument...the appellant contended specifically "that he merely had to sit down occasionally to accommodate his varicose veins."...&#8197;In its written closing argument...the agency addressed the issue of accommodation by reassignment and job restructuring, but did not mention the appellant's closing argument or his suggested accommodation [the agency's argument was mailed a day after the appellant's argument was posted].The administrative judge thereafter found that the agency could have reasonably accommodated the appellant by adopting his "suggestion" of "permitting him to have occasional rest periods where he could sit down before resuming his duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not articulate until his closing argument the "magic words" that he merely needed "to sit down occasionally" as reasonable accommodation, the agency was well aware throughout this case of his medical restrictions and qualifications. Indeed, the medical evidence of record, and the appellant's assertions in response to the agency's notice of proposed removal, plainly indicate that his medical restriction against prolonged standing could be accommodated if he were merely permitted to get off his feet for a while every few hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the fact that the appellant did not <span class="Italic">specifically</span> assert this accommodation...until his closing argument is not fatal to his claim. An administrative judge should consider timely-filed closing arguments....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has determined that an administrative judge commits prejudicial error by closing the record, or by not reopening the record, so as to deny a party an opportunity to respond to another party's material arguments or evidence first raised in a closing submission<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Gavette v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 166, 174 (1990); <span class="Italic">Cox v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 41 MSPR 686, 691-92 (1989). Here, the agency did not address the appellant's asserted accommodation in its November 22, 1988, closing argument apparently because it had not received his closing argument at that time. However, during the more than 2-week period that followed until the issuance of the December 7, 1988, initial decision, the agency did not (a) complain to the administrative judge that it was "surprised" by the appellant's asserted accommodation, (b) object to the raising of this accommodation, or (c) request that the record be kept open or the hearing continued so that it could present evidence or testimony on this issue. Nor has the agency shown that the administrative judge denied such requests<span class="Italic">. See, e.g, Miller v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 MSPR 122, 128 (1990); <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, 44 MSPR at 174; <span class="Italic">Lohr v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 383, 386 (1984). The agency's failure to object to the appellant's accommodation (that was specifically asserted in his closing argument and is supported by the evidence of record) or to the administrative judge's consideration of that specific argument thus constitutes a waiver of such an objection<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent argues that the agency was not required during the more than 2-week period after the record closed below to complain of surprise or request the administrative judge to reopen the record to permit it to respond to the appellant's reasonable accommodation argument specifically raised in his closing argument, and that permitting the agency to raise the matter before the full Board on petition for review is proper. Nothing, however, prohibited the agency from requesting the <span id="Page_3470"></span>administrative judge to reopen the record to permit it to submit rebuttal argument. The initial decision was not issued for over two weeks after the record closed; during this time period the administrative judge retained the authority to reopen the record upon the proper motion of the agency<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 1201.41(b), 1201.55, 1201.58 [now 1201.59]; <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 40 MSPR 443, 448 (1989). The agency in this appeal, however did nothing below to request the administrative judge to reopen the record to afford it an opportunity to respond to the appellant's closing argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency had not moved to reopen the record, but had instead below (a) objected to the appellant's accommodation argument because the agency would not have an opportunity to respond to it, or (b) submitted after the close of the record a rebuttal to the appellant's argument, the Board has held that it is prejudicial error for an administrative judge not to accept and consider such an additional rebuttal submission<span class="Italic">. See Lewis v. Department of the Air Force</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF07528910439, slip op. at 4-5 (July 10, 1991); <span class="Italic">Anastos v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 38 MSPR 18, 21-22 (1988). The agency in this appeal, however, did nothing below to submit rebuttal argument to the administrative judge, or to preserve an objection to the submission of the appellant's closing argument for the Board's review on petition for review<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Edgin v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-12-0767-I-1 (NP 12/30/2013), suggested that evidence of disability should not be presented for the first time after a removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted in her initial decision, the record reflects that the appellant did not present medical information to the agency concerning his alleged disabilities until after he was removed from employment. The appellant, moreover, concedes on petition for review that "it wasn't until Mar[ch] 2013...that I knew what caused the problem[.] " We agree with the administrative judge that, based on this record, the appellant cannot establish that the agency treated him differently based upon his disabled status or that the action appealed was based on his disability. <span class="Italic">See Henson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 6 (2009); <span class="Italic">see also Smith v. Department of the Interior</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6; 18 (2009) (articulating elements of a disability-based disparate treatment claim). Importantly, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has held that in order to maintain either a failure to accommodate claim or a disability-based disparate treatment claim, an appellant must show that he was a qualified individual with a disability at the time of the alleged unlawful discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A14669, 2003 WL 660615 (Feb. 21, 2003). In this case, however, the appellant did not present specific medical information to the agency concerning his limitations until after it effected his removal, and the medical information supplied by the appellant, moreover, postdates the agency's adverse action.[5] The EEOC has found that medical information, including medical diagnoses, which post-date an adverse action do not establish that an employee was disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act at the time of the earlier adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Pascale v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03850092, 1986 WL 634849 (March 5, 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Brown v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 05921024, 1992 WL 1370708 (April 1, 1993) ("the agency's accommodation obligation arises only when the disability is known....[t]he Commission must focus on the information available to the decision-maker at the time of the decision, as opposed to any information submitted into the record during the processing of this complaint.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;There is evidence in the record that the appellant submitted a doctor's note to the agency prior to his removal concerning his "bid to work as a mail technician" and his interest in "withdraw[ing] his bid for the bulk mail tech position." In response, the agency informed the appellant that this doctor's note did "not address any [of his] restrictions or inabilities to perform the essential functions of the position," and it declined to allow the appellant to withdraw his bid. We agree that this note, which lacks any medical diagnosis or medical explanation of the appellant's limitations, is insufficient to establish that the appellant was disabled at the time of his removal. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6; 19 ("A medical diagnosis of an impairment, by itself, is insufficient to prove disability; an appellant must offer evidence 'that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial, in terms of the employee's own experience.'") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ritter v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 334, 340 (1988) (AIDS was first identified to the agency as a disabling condition during a Board prehearing conference: "The Board has determined that an employee who asserts an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination must show that the agency possessed knowledge of the handicapping condition or should have possessed it under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Swafford v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 481, 483 (1983); <span class="Italic">Barner v. United States Postal Service,</span> 11 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1982).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Information pertaining to a disability may be provided to the agency long before disciplinary action is proposed. An accommodative responsibility arises when the agency is able to verify the appellant's disability status, a status that the appellant must articulate with reasonable specificity if the agency is to be charged with sufficient information to proceed to verify that status, <span class="Italic">McConnell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 163, 167, 169-70 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal does, however, squarely present the issue of when an agency's obligation to consider reassignment as an accommodation to an employee's handicapping condition begins. The agency has cited no authority to support its argument that it is required to reassign a qualified handicapped employee to a vacant position only at the time it proposes or effects an adverse action against the employee. To the contrary, we find that an agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation arises when an employee establishes his status as a qualified handicapped employee. <span class="Italic">See Clopton v. Dept. of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 378 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he record is clear that in May 1990, the agency was not in possession of any medical evidence showing that the appellant was unable to perform the duties of his former position or that he was a handicapped employee entitled to accommodation. By the terms of the appellant's testimony, he suffered an on-the-job injury (muscle strain), and his doctor <span class="Italic">suggested</span> he look for another position. His doctor did not, at that time, place any new limitations on his physical capacity. We find that, under these circumstances, the agency had no obligation to consider permanently reassigning the appellant, for it had no reason to suspect that the appellant had suffered anything more severe than a temporary muscle strain, and it had no medical evidence to support a conclusion that he was permanently unable to perform the regular duties of his former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basic obligation of an agency is to "make reasonable accommodation of the <span class="Italic">known</span> physical...limitations of a qualified handicapped employee...." 29 CFR 1613.704(a) (emphasis supplied). We thus find that, when an agency receives a complaint from an employee that he is unable to perform the duties of his position and requires a reassignment, the agency is entitled to assess independently the validity of the employee's statements, the medical and other evidence that purportedly establishes a handicapping condition requiring accommodation, and, if appropriate, the nature of the accommodations that would be both available and effective. An agency ought to be allowed a reasonable period of time in which to conduct its assessments and arrive at its conclusions. Moreover, it also seems reasonable to conclude that an agency is not required to put all other personnel actions on hold while such inquiries are being made, even if a personnel action concerns a position in which the employee has expressed an interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board case law supports the above propositions. In <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 378, we observed that the agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation does not arise until the employee establishes her status as a qualified handicapped employee. On the facts of this appeal, the appellant did not establish that he was a qualified handicapped employee until his doctor provided the results of the fitness for duty examination to the agency. We also held in <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 379, that an employee is entitled to be considered for reassignment as an accommodation only upon a showing that she is able to perform the essential functions of the position in question. Here, the rather vague and generalized statements made by the appellant to Rogalla on May 18, 1990, were clearly insufficient to establish his status as a qualified handicapped employee or to establish that he was able to perform the essential functions of the LDO position, despite his alleged physical inability to perform in his former position. No such showing was even arguably made until the results of the fitness for duty examination were communicated to the agency in February 1991, some 9 months after he requested his reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also true that the purpose of 29 USC 794, the statutory basis for the requirement that Federal employees' handicaps be reasonably accommodated, is to protect them against discrimination on the basis of their handicaps, not to provide them with rights greater than they would otherwise have. <span class="Italic">See Patrick v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 392, 396 (1988). To hold that the appellant is immediately entitled to reassignment to the position of his choice merely upon a vague articulation to his supervisor that his doctor suggested he look for another job because his present one might cause him risks "down the road," and without requiring that he establish his status as a qualified handicapped employee and that he could perform the duties of the LDO position, would clearly give this appellant greater rights than he otherwise would have had.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must also be remembered that even an employee who establishes that he is a qualified handicapped employee is not entitled to reassignment to the position of his choice. Rather, he is entitled only to a reasonable accommodation, which may include job restructuring, acquisition of special equipment, and other similar actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 153 (1988). Thus, if an agency were to accommodate an employee by restructuring the appellant's position and the appellant were to argue on appeal that he should have instead received a reassignment, we would be obliged to find no discrimination, assuming <span id="Page_3471"></span>that the restructuring was a valid accommodation. Thus, when the employee establishes his status as a qualified handicapped employee, the agency must be allowed a reasonable period of time in which to evaluate its options in order to determine which of any possible accommodations are most suited to its needs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the record establishes that, once the agency received the results of the fitness for duty examination that established the appellant's status as a qualified handicapped employee, it considered reassignment and conducted a search for vacant positions within the agency for which the appellant qualified and which were consistent with his medically-imposed physical restrictions, we find that the agency met its obligations with respect to its duty to consider reassignment. Thus, we sustain the agency's removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McConnell</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 159, 165-66 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency did not discriminate against the appellant based on a mental disability, because the appellant never clearly explained to the agency the nature and extent of his mental condition and what form of accommodation he needed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency cannot be faulted for not accommodating the appellant's mental condition, assuming solely for purposes of argument that the appellant has a mental condition that rises to the level of a "disability," that such condition could have been accommodated, and that his condition caused the attendance deficiency for which he was removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203. The appellant, who had a lawyer, had a full and fair opportunity to explain to the agency the nature and extent of his mental condition and what he thought needed to be done to allow him to return to work. Instead, he gave every indication that by late 1991 he was away from work <span class="Italic">solely</span> because of the injury to his hands. The agency's decision to remove the appellant for failure to meet attendance requirements was not the product of discrimination based on the appellant's mental condition because the appellant deliberately kept the agency in the dark about his mental condition. <span class="Italic">See Schulte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 126, 130-31 (1991) (where an employee did not respond to an agency's request to provide medical evidence about how his supposed mental condition affected his ability to perform his duties, the employee's claim on appeal from his removal that the agency should have accommodated his mental condition failed); <span class="Italic">see also McConnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 163, 168-69 (1994) (an agency was not liable for not considering accommodation of an employee's physical condition by reassignment, when it had no evidence to indicate that the employee could not perform the duties of his regular position); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 41 MSPR 374, 376, 378-79 (1989) (the appellant's claim that his removal for failure to follow instructions was the result of disability discrimination failed, because the appellant did not inform his supervisors that certain assignments were beyond his medical restrictions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some early Board decisions involving employees asserting alcoholism as a defense to proposed actions implied an element of required forgiveness for past performance deficiencies. That approach is not likely to be followed under more recent decisions. An allegation of alcoholism raised for the first time in the reply to an adverse action proposal was sufficient notice of a disabling condition, and the agency was required to consider that assertion in reaching its decision--even if it was the agency's first notice of the possibility that alcoholism may account for the employee's actions. <span class="Italic">Noe v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 86, 88-90 (1985) (reversing a dismissal when the agency failed to provide accommodation after the employee raised a claim of alcoholism during the oral reply); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sloan v. IRS</span>, 28 MSPR 77, 79 (1985) (reversing a removal for harmful error when the appellant raised, and the agency essentially ignored, the affirmative defense of alcoholism raised in an oral reply to the removal proposal); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Pitsenberger v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 403, 406 (1982) (no knowledge of mental disability; "witnesses perceived the appellant as strong-willed, principled, stubborn, and obstinate"); <span class="Italic">Ruzek v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPR 437, 444, 7 MSPB 307 (1981) (appellant's supervisor had some knowledge of the appellant's alcoholism prior to the response to the removal proposal). It is unlikely that the Board will now require accommodation for past substandard performance when a disability claim is first made in reply to a proposed action, but the condition may serve as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Koester v. U.S. Park Police</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2613.Opinion.1-3-2019.pdf">758 Fed. Appx. 925</a> (Fed.
