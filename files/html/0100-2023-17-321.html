<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-319"><span class="space">m.</span> Dismissals of Probationer, Term or Temporary Employee; Student</h5>
<p class="noindent">When the issue of coverage of probationers by negotiated agreement was first addressed by FLRA, it was determined that probationary dismissals could be reviewed by arbitrators. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE and Dept. of Labor</span>, 4 FLRA 376, 382 (1980). That position was reversed by the courts, and, following <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS v. FLRA</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 726-29 (D.C. Cir. 1983), FLRA began to vacate arbitration decisions that set aside probationary terminations. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 3342</span>, 14 FLRA 164, 164-65 (1984). That result continues. [Review Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-241.html#sec6-242">Probationary, Term or Temporary, and NAF Employees</a>," for the scope of bargaining as to probationers.]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2006 and SSA</span>, 58 FLRA 297, 298 (2003), confirmed the bar to direct or indirect substantive review by arbitrators of probationary terminations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union challenges the Arbitrator's findings that the Grievance was not arbitrable because it concerned the termination of a probationary employee and that the parties' agreement could not provide protections against termination for probationary employees. As correctly noted by the Arbitrator, not only are the merits of a probationary employee removal not subject to review in arbitration, but parties also cannot provide procedural protections for probationary employees through the collective bargaining process. Award at 7 (citing to <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dept of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization</span> <span class="Italic">Serv. v. FLRA, </span>709 F.2d 724 (D.C. Cir. 1983) and <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Nellis Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Las Vegas, Nev., </span>46 FLRA 1323 (1993)), respectively. Therefore, the Union has not established that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law when he found that the grievance was not arbitrable and that the parties' agreement could not establish procedural protections for probationary employees regarding their termination. As for the precedent cited by the Union, none of those decisions establish that parties may negotiate procedural protections against removal and thus these decisions provide no support for the Union's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">GSA Region 2 and AFGE Council 236</span>, 58 FLRA 588, 589 (2003) (arbitrator <span id="page_2302"></span>without the authority to set aside probationary termination based on provisions of negotiated agreement that required supervisors to inform probationers of their critical elements and performance standards, to observe employees closely during probation and to bring to employees' attention problems with their performance).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator correctly concluded that she had no jurisdiction over a challenge to the termination of a Federal Career Internship Program employee, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 103 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP Long Beach</span>, 66 FLRA 416, 418 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that grievances concerning the termination of a probationary employee are excluded from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure as a matter of law.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., BLS</span>, 66 FLRA at 284. This is based on "Congress's intention to allow summary termination of probationary employees." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d 1273, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>). Further, that certain matters involving a probationary employee's termination may be appealed through an administrative procedure does not mean that those matters may be resolved through the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1276-77. Such a finding would be contrary to "Congress's intention that collective bargaining <span class="Italic">not </span>supplement probationers' existing procedural protections." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1276 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found, and the parties do not dispute, that the grievant was a probationary employee at the time of her termination. <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. at 292 (FCIP appointments "serve functionally as competitive service probationary periods"). Because grievances concerning the termination of a probationary employee are excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure as a matter of law, the above-stated principles support the Arbitrator's finding that the grievance, which "griev[ed the] removal" of the grievant, was not arbitrable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., BLS</span>, 66 FLRA at 284. Further, the Union's argument that it could have appealed the suitability action to the MSPB, does not establish that the grievance was arbitrable, <span class="Italic">see NTEU</span>, 848 F.2d at 1276-77. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's determination that the grievance was not arbitrable is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA does not permit indirect attack on the authority of an agency to separate a probationer. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Nellis AFB and AFGE Local 1199</span>, 46 FLRA 1323, 1325-27 (1993), decided that an arbitrator lacked authority to consider a challenge to a probationer's unacceptable performance appraisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Union that the Statute does not preclude a probationary, competitive service employee from being covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 762-63 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>), we recently reaffirmed that all negotiations over matters concerning the probationary period are not precluded by law and regulation. However, we find that the Union has misconstrued the Arbitrator's award. In our view, the Arbitrator did not rule that in every instance probationers are precluded from coverage of a collective bargaining agreement. Instead, he ruled that to the extent the Union was requesting that he reevaluate the grievant's performance and raise her performance rating to fully successful, the grievance was not arbitrable. Accordingly, the Union's claim provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the Arbitrator's finding that he was precluded from substituting his evaluation of the performance of a probationary employee for that of management is deficient. In <span class="Italic">INS</span>, the court found that, in the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress expressly preserved an agency's discretion to summarily remove a probationary employee. 709 F.2d at 729. The court further noted that Congress instructed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and not the FLRA to implement the probationary program and to provide whatever procedural protections are necessary for probationary employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Relying on <span class="Italic">INS</span>, we have ruled that procedural protections for probationary employees cannot be established through collective bargaining under the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Division of Bank Supervision, Chicago Region, Chicago, Illinois</span>, 39 FLRA 848 (1991) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d 1273 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>), the court reiterated its earlier <span class="Italic">INS</span> ruling that Congress intended agencies to retain the power to summarily terminate probationary employees. The court held that to allow probationary employees to grieve their separations if based on unlawful discrimination "would eviscerate Congress's intention that collective bargaining not supplement probationers' existing procedural protections." 848 F.2d at 1276.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these decisions, the Authority has stated that the probationary period</p>
<p class="noindent-2">is part of the process by which management determines whether a newly-hired employee should be retained permanently. It provides the Agency with an opportunity to make such judgment prior to affording employees procedural protections established under Agency regulations or collective bargaining agreements in the event of termination for unacceptable work performance or conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Service Employees' International Union, Local 556, AFL-CIO and Department of the Navy, Marine Corps Exchange, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii</span>, 26 FLRA 801, 805 (1987). Consequently, the Authority has determined that grievances over the separation of a probationary employee are contrary to law and regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has determined that bargaining proposals that would not authorize probationary employees to grieve their separation, but would provide such employees with other procedural protections prior to separation are inconsistent with law and regulation and are not negotiable. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 39 FLRA at 852 (provision requiring that management inform a probationer in writing of the reasons for separation, provide a meeting, and forward with its recommendation all materials presented by the probationer was found to constitute procedural protections beyond those provided by OPM); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1625 and Department of the Navy, Naval Air Station, Oceana, Virginia</span>, 30 FLRA 1105, 1128 (1988) (provision requiring that probationers receive written notice of their performance shortcomings and be counseled on how to bring their performance up to a fully acceptable level prior to separation was found to constitute procedural protections beyond those provided by OPM). In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, we recently found nonnegotiable a provision that would have permitted probationers to comment on their supervisor's statement of whether their performance, conduct, and character have been found satisfactory or unsatisfactory. 46 FLRA at 765. We held that such a provision established procedural protections for probationary employees that exceed those required by OPM in Federal Personnel Manual chapter 315, subchapter 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator's award that the grievance was not arbitrable is not contrary to law. Clearly, no probationer has the right under OPM regulations to challenge and obtain review of management's assessment of the performance of the probationer during the probationary period. In our view, for the Arbitrator to have ruled otherwise "would [have] eviscerate[d] Congress's intention that collective bargaining not supplement probationers' existing procedural protections." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 848 F.2d at 1276. Certainly, the general provisions of the Statute cited by the Union cannot provide otherwise. In <span class="Italic">INS</span>, the court rejected the Authority's reliance on the definitions of "employee" and "grievance" in section 7103(a) of the Statute, concluding that the issue of whether probationers could grieve their separations "cannot be resolved by mere reference to the broad definitional provisions in the [S]tatute." 709 F.2d at 729 n.22. We similarly conclude that the general provisions of sections 7102 and 7121 of the Statute cannot provide a basis for finding the award deficient. Accordingly, we will deny the Union's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, BLS and AFGE Local 12</span>, 66 FLRA 282, 284 (2011), concluded that an EEO allegation could not serve to provide jurisdiction to an arbitrator to consider a probationer's termination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a grievance concerning the termination of a probationary employee is excluded from the scope of negotiated grievance procedures as a matter of law.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See GSA, </span>58 FLRA at 589 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2006,</span> 58 FLRA 297, 298 (2003) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., SSA</span>, 14 FLRA 164, 164-65 (1984)). Accordingly, the merits of a probationary employee's termination are not subject to review in arbitration. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 58 FLRA at 298. Additionally, the Authority has held that a proposal that entitled a probationary employee to file a grievance challenging his or her termination on the basis of discrimination was nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 25 FLRA 1067, 1078 (1987). In upholding the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated that "to allow the mere allegation of discrimination to give a discharged probationary employee access to the grievance procedure, with concomitant power of the arbitrator to order reinstatement, would substantially thwart Congress's intention to allow summary termination of probationary employees." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d at 1275.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing supports a conclusion that the Union may not grieve the Agency's decision to terminate the grievant, <span class="Italic">see GSA</span>, 58 FLRA at 589, even by alleging that the Agency based its decision on discrimination, <span class="Italic">see NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d at 1277. Further, the decisions cited by the Union are inapposite, as neither decision involved a grievance challenging a probationary employee's termination. <span class="Italic">See Teamsters</span>, 557 F.2d at 1349-51; <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 60 FLRA at 568-69. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's determination that the grievance is arbitrable is contrary to law, and we set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See VAMC Poplar Bluff and AFGE Local 2338</span>, 72 FLRA 200, 201 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring) (recon. den., 72 FLRA 419 (2021)) (arbitrator lacked jurisdiction when the grievance alleged racial harassment of the grievant (a probationer), the grievant was later terminated for alleged AWOL, and the issue before the arbitrator included whether the grievant was discharged for just cause in addition to being the victim of discrimination: "Based on Authority precedent, the Arbitrator may not resolve a grievance concerning the Agency's decision to terminate the grievant, even where the grievance alleges that the Agency based its decision on discrimination.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_2303"></span>In a nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Yates v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 115 Fed. Appx. 57, 58-59 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), the Federal Circuit opined that limited (very limited) circumstances authorized the MSPB to review the dismissal of a probationer while an arbitrator would be precluded from assuming the same jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Before accepting this appointment, Ms. Yates had served in the agency for over three consecutive years in nonprobationary positions. During the probationary period, the agency proposed to remove Ms. Yates for failure to request leave properly, leaving work without permission, and making false statements. Under the terms of the Master Labor Agreement between the agency and the American Federation of Government Employees, Ms. Yates grieved her removal. The agency rejected the grievance as non-grievable and non-arbitrable "by statute."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Ms. Yates then had a choice. Because probationary employees are entitled to an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") if they have completed more than one year of continuous service under the holding of <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1999), she could appeal the agency's removal action to the Board. <span class="Italic">See McCormick v. Dept of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (following <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>). In the alternative, she could appeal the removal to arbitration and have her case decided by an arbitrator. The law, however, expressly provides that the employee may choose one avenue or the other, but not both. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) (2000). When the employee takes one appeal route, she is barred from later seeking relief pursuant to the other. <span class="Italic">See Whitaker v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 784 F.2d 1109, 1110 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the arbitrator, Ms. Yates argued that she should have the benefit of <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> because the law requires that an arbitrator apply the same substantive law to the appeal as would be applied by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 660, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1985) ("Congress clearly intended that an arbitrator would apply the same substantive rules as the Board does in reviewing an agency disciplinary decision."). In <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, this court held that an employee in the competitive service who was serving a probationary period at the time of her removal but who had completed more than one year of current continuous service had a right to appeal her grievance to the Board. 307 F.3d at 1342-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator recognized that under <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the Board would have had jurisdiction over a timely appeal by Ms. Yates. But the arbitrator declined to apply <span class="Italic">McCormick </span>to Ms. Yates's arbitration, and instead agreed with the agency that Ms. Yates grievance was not subject to arbitration because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4) expressly excludes from arbitration any grievance concerning "any examination, certification or appointment." In doing so, the arbitrator concluded that a probationary period is considered by law to be an extension of the examination process, and therefore arbitration cannot by law extend to any matters arising during an employee's probationary period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, such is the law. In <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court faced the very question of whether a probationary period is an "examination" for purposes of section 7121(c)(4). The court held that "Congress clearly linked the agency's right to discharge summarily a probationary employee to the probationary period."<span class="Italic"> Id</span>. at 727. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on explicit legislative history of the statute, which provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The probationary...period...is an extension of the examining process to determine an employee's ability to actually perform the duties of the position. It is inappropriate to restrict an agency's authority to separate an employee who does not perform acceptably during this period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 45 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2767.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Congress has explicitly forbidden the arbitration process from addressing issues concerning employee actions taken during probationary periods, the arbitrator dismissed Ms. Yates's case. Her timely appeal to this court followed, and we have jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703, and 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is true that on the facts of this case, the Board would have entertained jurisdiction. Ms. Yates, however, did not file with the Board first, and her later attempt to file with the Board was correctly rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ms. Yates's argument that this court should require an arbitrator to apply <span class="Italic">McCormick </span>to arbitration proceedings must fail for the same reason that the argument was rejected by the arbitrator. Congress has spoken with abject clarity with regard to the jurisdictional reach of arbitration. We agree that the law is clear: adverse employment actions taken during probationary periods are not subject to arbitration. The arbitrator correctly dismissed Ms. Yates's case.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to temporary employees, an arbitrator lacks jurisdiction to review a termination, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 65 FLRA 820, 821-22 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator erroneously found that the grievants were not prohibited from grieving their terminations and could be terminated only for just cause.&#x2003;As a general matter, the Authority has found that the termination of a temporary employee is not grievable or arbitrable as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., Div. of Depositor &#x0026; Asset Servs., Okla. City, Okla.</span>, 49 FLRA 894, 898 (1994) (finding that temporary employees are prohibited from contesting adverse and performance-based actions through the negotiated grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Council of Marine Corps Locals, Council 240</span>, 39 FLRA 839, 846 (1991) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 240</span>); <span class="Italic">Fed.

Moreover, the Authority has determined that agencies retain the right to terminate temporary employees summarily with minimal due process protections. <span class="Italic">See Mare Island</span>, 38 FLRA at 1428-30 (determining that, unlike competitive service employees, temporary employees are not afforded the protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 which requires an agency, among other things, to remove an employee "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service"). Consistent with that right, parties are prohibited from establishing any additional procedural protections that apply to the termination of temporary employees. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council 240</span>, 39 FLRA at 843, 844-46 (implicitly rejecting the union's argument that temporary employees are not excluded from coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511 and 4303 in the same manner as probationary employees and finding that the union's proposal allowing temporary employees in the bargaining unit to grieve disciplinary and performance actions was nonnegotiable); <span class="Italic">cf. U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Nellis Air Force Base, Las Vegas, Nev.</span>, 46 FLRA 1323, 1326-27 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Nellis AFB</span>) (determining that, because agencies retain the right to terminate probationary employees summarily with minimal due process protections, establishment through collective bargaining of any additional procedural protections applying to the termination of probationary employees is barred as inconsistent with law and regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the award is contrary to law. The Arbitrator's finding that the grievants were entitled to grieve their terminations under the parties' agreement is clearly erroneous because, as a matter of law, temporary employees are prohibited from contesting their terminations through the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council 240</span>, 39 FLRA at 846; <span class="Italic">Mare Island</span>, 38 FLRA at 1428-30. Also, the Arbitrator's determination that the grievants could be terminated only for just cause because they were employed under an implied contract is similarly without merit because agencies have the right to terminate temporary employees summarily, and parties are barred from establishing additional procedural protections that are not provided to terminated, temporary employees by statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council 240</span>, 39 FLRA at 844-46; <span class="Italic">Mare Island</span>, 38 FLRA at 1428-30; <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 65 FLRA 928 (2011) (no reason to set aside award of arbitrator who found that collective bargaining agreement did not provide basis for challenging termination of two temporary employees).</p>
<p class="noindent">The term employee can challenge through grievance and arbitration procedures a termination of employment that is alleged to be a ULP, <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Depositor and Asset Servs. and NTEU, Chap. 256</span>, 49 FLRA 894, 898-900 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that excepted service, temporary employees may not contest adverse and performance-based actions under statutory or negotiated procedures. <span class="Italic">See Mare Island</span>, 38 FLRA at 1428-30. It also is clear, however, that the non-renewal of a temporary appointment does not constitute an adverse or performance-based action. <span class="Italic">See FDIC, Oklahoma</span>, 48 FLRA at 326; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Army Reserve Personnel Center and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 900</span>, 34 FLRA 319 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Army Reserve</span>). The grievance in this case contests the non-renewal of a temporary appointment based on an alleged unfair labor practice. As such, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Mare</span> <span class="Italic">Island</span> is misplaced.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We also find misplaced the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, <span class="Italic">Orlando</span> [48 FLRA 462 (1993)], where we upheld an award that the parties' agreement excluded a grievance concerning the termination of a temporary employee. Unlike the grievant in this case, the grievant in <span class="Italic">FDIC, Orlando</span> challenged a removal for cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also has not demonstrated that the award conflicts with law on any other ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. FLRA</span>, 967 F.2d 658 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">PBGC v. FLRA</span>), the court addressed the issue of whether a nonpreference eligible, excepted service employee, who at that time was not permitted to contest adverse or performance-based actions through negotiated or statutory procedures, was nevertheless permitted to contest a separation as an alleged unfair labor practice.[8] The court found that "Congress, in enacting...5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a), provided that it <span id="page_2304"></span>is 'an unfair labor practice for an agency...to interfere with, restrain, or coerce <span class="Italic">any</span> <span class="Italic">employee</span> in the exercise...of any right under'" the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 665-66 (emphasis in original). The court noted that "Congress broadly defined the term 'employee' as 'an individual...whose employment...has ceased because of any unfair labor practice under section 7116...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 666. The court pointed out that Congress did not exclude nonpreference eligible, excepted service employees from the definition of "employee" and that there was no indication of Congressional intent to deny those employees the right to pursue unfair labor practice charges before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The separation in <span class="Italic">PBGC v. FLRA</span> occurred before passage of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990), which extended to nonprobationary, nonpreference eligible, excepted service employees the right to appeal certain adverse and performance-based actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Prior to passage of the Amendments, the Authority and the courts held that, as such employees were precluded from filing statutory appeals of such actions, they likewise were precluded from contesting the actions through negotiated grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board and National Labor Relations Board Professional Association</span>, 35 FLRA 1116 (1990). Following enactment of the Amendments, the Authority held that permitting nonpreference eligible, excepted service employees to grieve and arbitrate separations was not inconsistent with law. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 39 FLRA 346, 359 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "status of temporary employees is identical to that of nonpreference eligible excepted service employees before passage of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments[.]" <span class="Italic">Mare Island</span>, 38 FLRA at 1429. Accordingly, consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">PBGC v. FLRA</span>, we conclude that the fact that the grievant could not contest the non-renewal of his appointment as an adverse or performance-based action through statutory or negotiated procedures does not require, or support, a conclusion that the grievant also could not challenge the non-renewal as an alleged unfair labor practices before the Authority.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We also note, in this connection, that probationary employees are not precluded under the Statute from pursuing alleged unfair labor practices through statutory procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and Social Security Administration, Detroit Teleservice Center, Detroit, Michigan</span>, 42 FLRA 22, 54-55 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the grievant has access to statutory procedures to challenged alleged unfair labor practices, the grievant also has access to negotiated procedures, unless the parties have agreed to the contrary. In this regard, section 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute defines the term "grievance" to include "any claimed violation...of any law, rule, or regulation affected conditions of employment[.]" Thus, an employee or the union may allege in a grievance that an agency violated the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Region V and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 230</span>, 45 FLRA 737, 743-44 (1992). In addition, section 7123(a)(1) of the Statute, which precludes judicial review of Authority decisions in arbitration cases unless the decision involves an unfair labor practice under the Statute, clearly contemplates the arbitration of grievances involving alleged unfair labor practices. <span class="Italic">See also Internal Revenue</span> <span class="Italic">Service v. FLRA</span>, 963 F.2d 429 (D.C. Cir. 1992). As such, unless the parties agreed to exclude alleged unfair labor practices from the scope of their negotiated grievance procedure, the disputed action also is subject to challenge through the negotiated procedure.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;We note that section 7116(d) of the Statute provides that, except for matters which are encompassed by section 7121(e) and (f), issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised as either a grievance or an unfair labor practice charge. Section 7121(e) and (f) concern adverse and performance-based actions. As noted previously, the nonrenewal of a temporary appointment is neither an adverse nor a performance-based action. Accordingly, such action is not encompassed by section 7121(e) or (f) of the Statute and section 7116(d) does not preclude the instant grievance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Army Reserve</span>, 34 FLRA at 319.</p>
<p class="noindent">Without mention of <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Depositor and Asset Servs.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 70 FLRA 903, 903-05 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), determined in the context of nonrenewal of a student appointment that term or time-limited employee terminations, or denials of conversion or extension of their employment, could not be grieved:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue in this case is whether a student intern (the grievant) serving under a term appointment may grieve the Agency's decision not to convert her to a permanent position at the end of her appointment. Although Arbitrator Salvatore J. Arrigo found that the Agency had violated the grievant's contractual and statutory due-process rights in processing her "termination," we find that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to resolve the grievance in the first place. And we take this opportunity to clarify that, like probationary employees, term appointees and similar time-limited appointees may not file grievances challenging an agency's decision concerning extending, converting, or ending their employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union grieved, as relevant here, whether the Agency improperly denied the grievant her statutory due-process rights when it chose not to convert her to a permanent position. In enacting the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), Congress granted agencies the statutory right to terminate certain individuals without following the due-process procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512. For example, Congress granted agencies the statutory right to terminate probationary employees with minimal due process. And, in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, INS v. FLRA (INS)</span>,[26] the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the D.C. Circuit) concluded that allowing probationary employees to challenge adverse actions through arbitration would "undermine[&#8197;] the scheme Congress envisioned when it excluded probationary employees from [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7;] 4303 and 7513."[27] The court found that giving arbitrators the power to reinstate probationary employees through the grievance process would be "inconsistent with OPM's regulations" and would "usurp[&#8197;] the authority Congress conferred on OPM" to issue rules to help implement the CSRA.[28] Since that decision, the Authority has repeatedly held that a grievance concerning the termination of a probationary employee is not substantively grievable or arbitrable as a matter law.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With the foregoing principles in mind, we consider whether a dispute over an agency's decision not to convert an intern to a permanent position upon the expiration of her term appointment is substantively grievable or arbitrable.[30] The Authority has previously noted that OPM regulations "specifically exclude from the [definition of adverse] actions set forth in [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7;] 4303 and 7512 the termination of an appointment on an expiration date if the date was specified as a condition of employment at the time the appointment was made."[31] Consistent with those regulations, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) have held that an agency's decision not to convert an intern to a permanent position upon the expiration of the intern's term appointment was not an adverse action appealable to the MSPB.[32]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that the Agency appointed the grievant to an intern position under a term appointment not to exceed a certain date.[33] Therefore, the Agency's decision not to convert the grievant to a permanent position upon the expiration of her term appointment was not an adverse action appealable to MSPB.[34] In that way, the grievant here is analogous to the probationary employees considered by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">INS</span>. In that decision, the D.C. Circuit examined probationary employees' ineligibility for most statutory due-process protections to determine those employees' rights to challenge their terminations <span id="page_2305"></span>under a negotiated grievance procedure. The D.C. Circuit found that such challenges were not grievable or arbitrable because "[a] grievance/arbitration procedure entails the same type of after-the-fact review and limitation on an agency's decision as do the statutory appeals procedures."[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the same reasons that disputes relating to the termination of probationary employees are not grievable or arbitrable, term appointees--and similar time-limited appointees--may not challenge, through a negotiated grievance procedure, an agency's determination not to convert them to a permanent position upon the expiration of their term appointment. To hold otherwise would give arbitrators the power to grant an entirely new class of rights to term appointees that neither OPM nor Congress intended them to have.[36] This would fundamentally change the nature of term appointments like those in the Pathways program.[37] Congress did not give arbitrators the power to grant permanent-employee status to term appointees like the grievant here. Therefore, we conclude that this dispute is not grievable or arbitrable as a matter of law, and we set aside the award.</p>

<p class="noindent">It was implied by a court that the term employee should be able to secure grievance review through arbitration of the nonrenewal of the appointment based on an allegation that the nonrenewal constitutes a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Suzal v.
