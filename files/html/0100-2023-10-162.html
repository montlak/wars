<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-163"><span class="space">a.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span></span></h5>
<p class="noindent">The remarkable history of the <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span> litigation is briefly summarized. It was initially determined that the agency did not commit a ULP, as charged by an incumbent union, by not interfering with the solicitation of signatures to an election petition by another union. The solicitation occurred in the public areas of buildings controlled by GSA. The agency had no duty to go to GSA, a totally separate agency, and urge or insist that GSA forbid the other union from using GSA's space, contiguous to the agency's offices. <span class="Italic">DHHS, HCFA and AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 427, 436 (1985) (ALJ Decision). That decision was reviewed in court and remanded to FLRA for consideration of GSA regulations concerning property management. <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 333, 338 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The court resolved that FLRA must determine the extent of HCFA control, or influence over the control, of the public areas involved, and assuming HCFA control, the extent of that agency's responsibility if it were also determined that GSA improperly permitted access by the rival union to the public areas. On remand, <span class="Italic">DHHS, HCFA and AFGE</span>, 24 FLRA 672, 674-76 (1986), determined that GSA had control and custody of federal buildings outside the District of Columbia under statutory authority then codified to 40 USC 285. GSA had authority to assign and reassign the space of all executive agencies in government-owned and leased buildings in and outside the District of Columbia under statutory authority then codified to 40 USC 490(e). GSA property management regulations generally prohibited solicitation, vending, and debt collection in public areas. Among the exceptions to the prohibitions was subsection (c), providing for solicitation of labor organization membership or dues authorized by occupant agencies under the 1978 Reform Act. The circumstances, however, did not involve membership solicitation, within the control of occupant agencies; rather, they involved solicitation of signatures in support of a petition for election. Other regulations of GSA permitted grants of occasional use of public buildings, apparently at the discretion of GSA. On the basis of the GSA regulations, FLRA reaffirmed its earlier decision. GSA had exclusive control over the space. Use of the space by NTEU was not permitted by GSA and could not have been permitted by HCFA. Although as a tenant agency HCFA could have brought to the attention of GSA activities disruptive to the tenant's activities, it was GSA's prerogative to act. HCFA had no affirmative duty to persuade GSA to prevent or stop solicitation by the rival labor organization.</p>
<p class="noindent">Back to court. In <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 947, 951-53 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the D.C. Circuit affirmed: FLRA's conclusion was correct. HCFA did not have the authority to forbid NTEU solicitation of support for a representation election in the public areas of the complex. On remand, the record supported FLRA's conclusion that HCFA did not exercise <span class="Italic">de facto</span> control over the public areas in the complex. FLRA appropriately determined that HCFA did not have an affirmative duty to plead the incumbent union's cause to GSA as to the use of property outside the workplace and beyond the agency's direct control.</p>
<p class="noindent">The matter of nonincumbent union access to SSA/GSA facilities was not to end. It continued with <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span>, 45 FLRA 303, 325 (1992), concluding that SSA did not improperly exclude NTEU from soliciting at premises under its control, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d 537, 540 (D.C. Cir. 1993), remanding the case to the Authority for FLRA consideration of the First Amendment implications of its decisions concerning NTEU's access to agency property, <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span>, 52 FLRA 1159 (1997), avoiding the constitutional issue and instead refocusing the statutory analysis on alternative means of union access to employees, and <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Callahan</span>, 139 F.3d 214, 218-19 (D.C. Cir. 1998), requiring reconsideration by FLRA of the alternate access approach to a bar against direct solicitation by unions. <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 964, 965-66 (1999), then replaced an inflexible equivalent access rule with an approach measuring alternative means of union access to employees, developed in the private sector as a result of <span class="Italic">NLRB v.

<p class="noindent">We trace the more recent decisions. A decision surveyed existing law concerning the "equivalent status" rule and an agency's obligation to prevent certain solicitation by a rival without equivalent status to an incumbent union, <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span>, 45 FLRA 303, 315-24 (1992), involving access to agency-controlled premises:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(1) and (3) of the Statute by denying NTEU's permit requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7116(a)(3</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">sponsor, control, or otherwise assist any labor organization, other than to furnish, upon request, customary and routine services and facilities if the services and facilities are also furnished on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that there is no allegation or indication that NTEU has attained equivalent status under section 7116(a)(3). <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense Dependents School, Panama Region</span>, 44 FLRA 419, 425 (1992). Accordingly, we find that at the time of the permit requests, NTEU had not attained equivalent status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next consider SSA's obligations under section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute regarding access to the sidewalks at the Woodlawn facility by a union lacking equivalent status. When a rival union lacking equivalent status requests access to an agency's premises or facilities for the purpose of organizing employees, an agency unlawfully assists the rival union within the meaning of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute if the agency grants such a union access to the agency's premises or facilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, 840 F.2d at 950; <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, 793 F.2d at 336-37. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, New Mexico</span>, 44 FLRA 217, 224 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Medical Center</span>); <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census</span>, 24 FLRA 943, 946 n.2 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, it is clear that where an agency exercises no control over the public areas adjacent to its property, the agency does not violate section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute by failing to prohibit a rival union lacking equivalent status from entering those areas. However, it is also clear, under <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, that if an agency influences or exercises control over access to such public areas, an agency would violate section 7116(a)(3) if it granted a union lacking equivalent status access to them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similar to the property in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, the sidewalks at issue in this case are public areas under section 101.20.400 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. of the FPMRs. However, unlike <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, where GSA controlled the permit process, the parties in this case stipulate that, pursuant to a delegation agreement between GSA and HHS/SSA, "SSA is responsible for administering the permit process" by which access is granted to the public areas of the Woodlawn facility....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the parties stipulate that SSA has in fact granted access to the public areas in question to outside groups, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Disabled American Veterans, and the American Legion. Therefore, unlike the employing agency in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, SSA has exercised control over access to the public areas in the past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the delegation agreement, the FPMRs, and SSA's past practice of granting access to the public areas of the Woodlawn facility, we find that SSA clearly exercises control over the public areas in question. As discussed below in connection with NTEU's argument on this issue, we further find that SSA has the discretion under the FPMRs to grant or deny permit requests and that nothing in the FPMRs precludes SSA from <span id="page_152"></span>exercising that discretion. As SSA exercises control over the public areas in question and as SSA is the employing agency of employees represented by an incumbent union, we find, in the absence of the exception noted below, that under <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, SSA would have violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute had it granted NTEU a permit to enter the public areas for the purpose of distributing literature to those SSA employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "sole exception" to the rule prohibiting an agency from granting access to its property pursuant to <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span> is that a union lacking equivalent status "may obtain access to an agency's facilities if it demonstrates to the agency that, after diligent effort, it has been unable to reach the agency's employees through reasonable, alternative means of communication." <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, 793 F.2d at 337 n.9. This exception was recognized by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations (Assistant Secretary) under Executive Order 11491, the predecessor to the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Natick</span>, 3 A/SLMR at 196 (a labor organization lacking equivalent status may be granted access to agency or activity premises "only in circumstances where it can be established that the employees involved are inaccessible to reasonable attempts by the labor organization to communicate with them outside the agency's or activity's premises").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employees in <span class="Italic">Natick</span> resided in scattered areas throughout a large metropolitan area. The facility in <span class="Italic">Natick</span> was guarded and enclosed by a high fence. Employees were difficult to reach entering and exiting the facility because the majority of employees drove to the facility and distribution of materials to those employees would have had to be done from the street. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 201-02. The Assistant Secretary found that an employer may grant access to its facility to non-employee representatives of a rival union in special circumstances where the rival union "has made a diligent, but unsuccessful, effort to contact the employees away from the [employer's] premises and that its failure to communicate with the employees was based on their inaccessibility." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 196. Applying that standard, the Assistant Secretary concluded that the evidence did not support the contention that the employees were inaccessible outside the employer's premises. The Assistant Secretary noted that the rival union:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">did reach some of the employees by mail, that others were accessible, that only one major location was involved...and that there [was] no evidence that [the rival union] requested employees to distribute literature during their non-work times in non-work areas on the [employer's] premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Natick</span> and will apply it to this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Medical Center</span>, 44 FLRA at 225-26. We find that the record does not establish that SSA employees at the Woodlawn facility were inaccessible outside of the facility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As was the situation in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>, NTEU has alleged in this case that it was unable to reach SSA employees at only one site. Similar to the employees in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>, the employees at the Woodlawn facility live throughout a large metropolitan area and are difficult to reach entering and exiting the facility. NTEU has attempted to contact employees through various means and has had some success. NTEU has used a commercial search firm through which it has located 6 percent of Woodlawn employees and, through contacts with employees and searches of local phone books, it has doubled its list of home addresses. NTEU also has passed out leaflets on city buses entering the Woodlawn facility, met with groups of employees, and met with some employees at home. There is no evidence that NTEU "requested employees to distribute literature during their non-work times in non-work areas on the [agency's] premises." <span class="Italic">Natick</span> at 196. On the record before us, we find that employees in this case are no more inaccessible than were the employees in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU argues that the alternative means of communicating with SSA employees at the Woodlawn facility are inadequate as they are costly and do not necessarily provide face-to-face contact with employees....&#8197;However, we find, as described above, that the situation facing NTEU is similar to the situation facing the rival union in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>. In <span class="Italic">Natick</span>, the record did not show that the employees were inaccessible outside the activity's premises. Similarly, the record in this case does not show that SSA's Woodlawn employees are inaccessible outside the Woodlawn premises or that any inability of NTEU to reach SSA employees at the Woodlawn facility is due to the employees' inaccessibility, rather than other factors such as cost. In view of our finding that the situation facing NTEU is similar to the situation facing the rival union in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>, we conclude that no special circumstances exist that would warrant applying the exception to the rule articulated in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>. Accordingly, we conclude that SSA would have violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute had it granted NTEU a permit to the public areas of the Woodlawn facility. Thus, in denying NTEU's permit requests, SSA did not unlawfully assist AFGE in violation of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the General Counsel's argument that SSA would not have violated section 7116(a)(3) had it granted NTEU's permit requests because "[u]nlawful assistance within the meaning of the Statute should not be read to condone the discriminatory treatment of a labor organization otherwise entitled under the law to challenge an incumbent."...&#8197;Consistent with the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, an agency that influences or controls access to the public areas adjacent to its property violates section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute if it grants a union lacking equivalent status access to those public areas. Therefore, where access to property within the agency's control is concerned and where agency employees are represented by an incumbent union, section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute requires the agency to treat a union lacking equivalent status differently from other organizations. Further, the General Counsel's reliance on <span class="Italic">DODDS</span> is misplaced. <span class="Italic">DODDS</span> did not involve a question of equivalent status or access to agency property by non-employee organizers of a rival union. Rather, <span class="Italic">DODDS</span> concerned the right of a unit employee to post rival union literature on agency property.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject NTEU's argument that SSA violated section 7116(a)(3) when it denied a rival union access to public, as opposed to non-public, areas of Government property because, according to NTEU, SSA's obligations are different when the property involved constitutes a public area under the FPMRs....&#8197;The property at issue in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span> also was public. Nevertheless, the court stated that HCFA would have violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute if it possessed "authority to permit (and therefore to prohibit)" the distribution or solicitation in the public areas by the rival union lacking equivalent status. <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, 793 F.2d at 338. As SSA has the authority to permit and prohibit NTEU from gaining access to the public areas of the Woodlawn facility, SSA would have violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute had it granted NTEU a permit when NTEU lacked equivalent status. In these circumstances, SSA properly denied NTEU access to its premises and, contrary to NTEU's argument, did not violate section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. In this regard, NTEU's reliance on <span class="Italic">Grissom Air Force Base</span> is misplaced. Unlike this case, <span class="Italic">Grissom Air Force Base</span> involved an agency's obligation to remain neutral "in areas beyond the agency's direct control." <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, 840 F.2d at 955 (citing <span class="Italic">Grissom Air Force Base</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU argues further that SSA had "no more authority under the governing regulations to deny NTEU access than did HCFA in the <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> cases" because "SSA did not have the authority to deny NTEU's permit requests under the [FPMRs]." We disagree. As we have found, SSA was authorized under the delegation agreement and the FPMRs to grant permits for access to the public areas of the Woodlawn facilities for activities that SSA determines are cultural, educational, or recreational, and which do not constitute activities requiring the denial of access under section 101.20.403 of the FPMRs. Nothing in the FPMRs permits SSA to grant an organization a permit to conduct cultural, educational, or recreational activities in the public areas where doing so would violate law. Accordingly, the FPMRs do not preclude SSA from denying NTEU's permit requests in the circumstances of this case. Further, as the delegation agreement and the FPMRs authorized SSA to exercise control over access to the public areas of the Woodlawn facility, and as SSA has in fact exercised control over access to those areas in the past, we conclude that the authority exercised by SSA in this case is clearly greater than, and distinguishable from, HCFA's authority in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note NTEU's contention that SSA was precluded from denying NTEU's permit requests by the First Amendment. We are aware of the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Perry</span>. However, in this unfair labor practice proceeding, we do not address the extent to which NTEU's activities may be protected by the U.S. Constitution....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we find that SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute by denying NTEU's permit requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU and the General Counsel argue that SSA discriminatorily applied its permit policy to NTEU in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. In this regard, the General Counsel argues that "[t]he only reason NTEU cannot obtain a permit to distribute literature on [the] Respondent's public space is because NTEU is a labor organization."...&#8197;Further, NTEU contends that an employer's no-distribution rule is valid only if it "does not discriminate against the union by allowing other distribution." According to NTEU, "SSA does not maintain a uniform non-solicitation rule" at its Woodlawn facility and, therefore, SSA's rule is contrary to section 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute when it denied NTEU's permit requests, while at the same time granting permits to other organizations such as the American Legion and Mothers Against Drunk Driving.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have already found that SSA would have violated section 7116(a)(3) had it granted NTEU access to public areas of the Woodlawn facility within SSA's control. Put simply, section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute required SSA to treat NTEU differently from other organizations, including the American Legion and Mothers Against Drunk Driving.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU asserts that its non-employee organizers possess rights "derivative" of employees' rights under section 7102 of the Statute, and that SSA violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by interfering with the exercise <span id="page_153"></span>of those rights. NTEU further asserts that nothing in public or private sector case law indicates that "non-employee union organizers' rights in public areas depend upon whether there has first been an employee-initiated request to allow the non-employee access." According to NTEU, requiring such a request would "undermine the very rights the [Statute] protects by precluding uninformed employees from acquiring information they need to exercise their rights."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7102 of the Statute protects the rights of employees to distribute and receive union-related literature during non-work times in non-work areas....&#8197;However, there is no evidence in this case that any employee attempted to distribute literature on behalf of NTEU or requested to receive materials from NTEU on SSA's premises. We reject NTEU's argument that non-employee organizers of a union lacking equivalent status should be granted access to agency-controlled property even in the absence of a request by employees to allow such access. To adopt NTEU's argument would render section 7116(a)(3) meaningless because section 7116(a)(3) could never preclude a union lacking equivalent status from gaining access to agency-controlled property. To the extent that NTEU's non-employee organizers may possess a derivative right under section 7102 that is protected by section 7116(a)(1), we find that, in the circumstances of this case, SSA did not interfere with any such right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that there is tension between section 7116(a)(3) and section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. In section 7116(a)(3), Congress limited a rival union's access to agency property in specific circumstances in order to, among other things, enhance the stability of labor-management relationships achieved through a meaningful bargaining relationship between an agency and an incumbent exclusive representative....&#8197;Therefore, even assuming that a derivative right under section 7116(a)(1) generally encompasses access to agency property by non-employee union organizers, we find that where there is an incumbent exclusive representative and a rival union seeks access to agency-controlled premises, Congress has provided in section 7116(a)(3) that in the interest of labor-management stability, with certain exceptions not present here, non-employee organizers of the rival union are entitled to such access only if the rival union attains equivalent status. Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, we find that SSA was required by section 7116(a)(3) to deny NTEU's permit requests and that, in so doing, SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> led to plenty of litigation. The case was remanded to FLRA for consideration of First Amendment issues inherent in control of property that is conditionally available to outside groups but denied to a rival union, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d 537, 538-40 (D.C. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Woodlawn facility is owned by the General Services Administration.&#x2003;The SSA is not the sole tenant of the facility, however, other federal agencies, such as the Health Care Financing Administration, also lease space there<span class="Italic">. AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 333 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The outside areas at Woodlawn are not leased to the SSA or to any other tenant; the SSA merely administers those areas pursuant to a delegation agreement it entered into with the GSA in 1986.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the delegation agreement, the GSA had permitted the NTEU to collect signatures in the outside areas at Woodlawn. When the SSA took over administration of the facility, it refused the NTEU access in the belief that for it (as opposed to the GSA) to grant such access would be an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d at 336-337 (employer required to treat non-incumbent union less favorably than incumbent union). The NTEU charged the SSA with committing an unfair labor practice in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(I) of the Statute, which provides that an agency not "interfere with, restrain or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any [protected] right." Before the Authority had ruled, the NTEU brought a second action, this time in the district court, claiming that the SSA's refusal to give it a permit violated the Union's rights under the first amendment. The district court dismissed the suit because the NTEU had not first exhausted its administrative remedies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, this court agreed that exhaustion was required. We held, however, that because the NTEU's constitutional claim was urgent but could not be adjudicated fully in an administrative proceeding, the case should remain on the district court's docket for three months. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. King</span>, 961 F.2d 240 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">King I</span>). If by the end of that time the Authority had not decided the statutory issue before it, or had ruled against the NTEU, then the district court could properly rule upon the merits of the Union's constitutional claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just short of three months later the Authority issued its decision, holding that the SSA's refusal to grant the NTEU access to the outdoor areas at Woodlawn was not an unfair labor practice under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). Further, the FLRA opined that the SSA would have committed an unfair labor practice under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) had it issued the permit. That section provides that an agency may not "sponsor, control or otherwise assist any labor organization, other than to furnish, upon request, customary and routine services and facilities if the services and facilities are also furnished on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status." In reaching these conclusions, the Authority expressly declined to consider either the NTEU's contention that the first amendment should guide the Authority's construction of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) or its claim that its first amendment rights were abridged by the SSA's refusal to grant it a permit. <span class="Italic">SSA &#x0026; NTEU &#x0026; AFGE</span>, No. 3-CA-10859 (June 22, 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court then reopened the case before it, found that the outdoor areas at Woodlawn are a "public forum," and held that by denying the NTEU a permit the SSA had abridged the Union's first amendment rights. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. King</span>, 798 F. Supp. 780 (D.D.C. July 24, 1992) (<span class="Italic">King II</span>) (appeal pending). Meanwhile, the NTEU petitioned for review of the FLRA decision. It is that petition that we decide today.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Analysis</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NTEU urged the Authority, and the Authority refused, to consider the first amendment implications should it interpret &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) to bar the SSA from issuing the Union a permit to distribute literature on the sidewalks of a campus-like federal facility....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We did not suggest in <span class="Italic">King I</span>, however, nor do the cited cases, that the Authority may not consider the constitutional implications of its choice between permissible interpretations of the Statute. It is a commonplace, of course, that "constitutional policy can provide a valuable aid in determining the legitimate boundaries of statutory meaning," <span class="Italic">Singer</span>, 2A <span class="Italic">Sutherland</span> <span class="Italic">Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 56.02 (4th ed. 1984)--and no less so, we suppose, when an agency rather than a court is reading the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority is prohibited only from disposing of a case upon constitutional rather than statutory grounds, not from taking into account the uncertain constitutionality of the Statute as interpreted one way but not another. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Meredith v. FCC</span>, 809 F.2d 863, 872-73 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The consequences could be most untoward if the Authority were at large to select one of two or more reasonable interpretations of the Statute without regard to the constitutional question it would present. This court would then presumably be obligated to defer to the Authority's reasonable interpretation of the Statute, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), and thus perhaps to resolve a constitutional issue that would not arise under the other reasonable reading of the law. The norm of constitutional avoidance counsels against this result....&#8197;That is not to say that the agency is obliged to adopt the reading that avoids the constitutional issue, but only that it is obliged to consider the possible invalidity of the Statute in selecting between reasonable readings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Had the FLRA been receptive to the constitutional implications of its the statutory analysis, it would still have had to reject the NTEU's claim that, in light of the first amendment concerns, the anti-favoritism norm (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span> do not treat unlikes alike) of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) should not be applied to non-work areas. That interpretation of the Statute was effectively foreclosed by our decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d at 337 (noting that "counsel for FLRA properly conceded at oral argument that, but for the question of GSA involvement, there would be no doubt that permitting NTEU into the building in question (whether or not into the actual work areas) would constitute unlawful assistance").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority might well, have noticed another argument, however, although the Union did not present it as clearly as it might have done. This court has interpreted &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) as requiring an agency to exclude a union without status equivalent to that of the incumbent union--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a union that had not submitted to the FLRA enough signatures to force an election from "its premises" or "its facilities." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d at 337 n.9. In this case it is by no means clear, however, and the Authority did not determine, whether the outside areas of Woodlawn, which the SSA administers pursuant to the delegation from the GSA but which are not leased to the SSA, constitute "its premises" or "its facilities" for the purposes of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3). If they do not, then in granting a permit for access thereto the agency would presumably be acting in its capacity as the GSA's building manager and not in its capacity as an employer. Before we are asked to resolve the first amendment issue precipitated by the Authority's interpretation of the Statute, the Authority ought to consider this statutory question, mindful of the first amendment implications of its determination.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> returned to the region on remand so that FLRA could determine whether outside areas of the Woodlawn SSA complex were premises or facilities of the SSA for purposes of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 1376, 1376 (1993), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 48 FLRA 539 (1993). The <span class="Italic">Woodlawn</span> decisions continued in 1997, following remand from the D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d 537, 540 (D.C. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, with an opinion from FLRA addressing both the ULP and constitutional components of access to agency premises by nonincumbent rival labor organizations. In <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span>, 52 FLRA 1159, 1160-1163, 1166-1190 (1997), shifting focus to whether the agency action sponsored, controlled, or assisted a labor organization, through the denial of access to agency premises, FLRA again attempted to set out the determinants of what constitutes permissible and impermissible aid and comfort to incumbent and rival labor organizations. FLRA determined that "an agency will not be automatically obliged by the Authority's interpretation of <span id="page_154"></span>section 7116(a)(3) to require as a condition to furnishing routine services and facilities, including access to agency premises, that a rival labor organization have obtained equivalent status to an incumbent, without regard to whether the provision of such services and facilities, in and of itself, sponsors, controls, or assists a labor organization." FLRA allowed an agency to permit some public use of the property but deny access to a rival union if that union had a reasonable alternative means of communicating with agency employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Facts</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts, established by two stipulations and set out fully in the Authority's previous decision (<span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 304-06), are summarized briefly herein. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) is the exclusive representative of a nationwide unit for SSA employees. Although these bargaining unit employees are dispersed at approximately 1300 sites across the country, 9,000 bargaining unit employees are located at SSA's headquarters facility at Woodlawn, Maryland (Woodlawn).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SSA headquarters complex at Woodlawn consists of office buildings, parking lots, lawns, and pedestrian sidewalks that offer access to the buildings. The Woodlawn facility is operated jointly by SSA and GSA pursuant to a delegation agreement between GSA and the Department of Health and Human Services. The sidewalks surrounding Woodlawn's office buildings are considered public areas for the purposes of the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMRs); however, persons or organizations desiring to use these public areas must obtain a permit to do so. 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101-20.401. Under the delegation agreement, SSA is responsible for administering the permit process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In May 1991, SSA denied an NTEU organizer, who was not an SSA employee, a permit to distribute literature on the sidewalks of the Woodlawn facility. SSA also denied NTEU's appeal of the Agency's refusal to issue a permit. Between November 1989 and April 1991, SSA had granted permits to distribute various information and materials on the Woodlawn sidewalks to the Disabled American Veterans, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and the American Legion. The record does not indicate whether any other organizations sought permits from SSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Litigation of the Access Issue</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU challenged SSA's refusal to issue a permit in two forums. First, NTEU filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that SSA's refusal to permit the distribution of literature violated NTEU's First Amendment right to free speech. Second, NTEU filed the ULP charge which formed the basis of the instant case alleging that in denying the permit, SSA both unlawfully assisted AFGE in violation of section 7116(a)(3) and discriminated against NTEU in violation of section 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the Authority issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, on June 22, 1992, dismissing the ULP complaint, the district court proceeding was reinstituted. The district court found that the sidewalks at Woodlawn constituted a "public forum" and that SSA had violated NTEU's First Amendment rights by denying access to those areas. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. King</span>, 798 F. Supp. 780 (D.D.C. 1992) (<span class="Italic">King II</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE, intervenor in the case, appealed to the D.C. Circuit. (<span class="Italic">NTEU v. King</span>, No. 92-5272). That case, argued on the same day and before the same panel as <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, remains pending.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The ULP Allegations Against SSA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority's Determination on the ULP</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded that SSA did not violate sections 7116(a)(1) or (3) of the Statute when it denied NTEU access to the Woodlawn complex and, therefore, dismissed the ULP complaint<span class="Italic">. Social Sec. Admin.</span>, 45 FLRA at 304.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found that, had SSA granted NTEU's request for permission to distribute literature in Woodlawn's "public areas," it would have violated section 7116(a)(3) by unlawfully assisting NTEU. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 320. In making this determination, the Authority concluded that, when a rival union lacking "equivalent status" [3] requests access to an "agency's facilities" for the purpose of organizing employees, the agency unlawfully assists the rival union within the meaning of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute if the agency grants such access. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 315. Central to the Authority's reasoning was the finding that SSA, as a result of the delegation from GSA, exercised control over access to the public areas at the Woodlawn facility<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 317-18.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;A rival union obtains "equivalent status" with an incumbent union when a petition for election is properly filed with the Authority and the appropriate Authority Regional Director determines that there has been a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Defense, Dependents School, Panama Region and Education Association of Panama and Panama Canal Federation of Teachers, Local 29</span>, 44 FLRA 419, 425-26 (1992) (<span class="Italic">DOD, Dependents School</span>). It is undisputed that NTEU had not achieved equivalent status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and NTEU argued that NTEU should have been granted access to the Woodlawn public areas despite its lack of equivalent status because it was unable to reach the SSA's employees through alternative means of communication. Acknowledging that this was an exception to the general rule prohibiting access to a union lacking equivalent status, the Authority concluded nonetheless that NTEU had failed to show that the SSA employees were inaccessible outside of the Agency's premises. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 320.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also rejected the contention that SSA discriminatorily applied its permit policy in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 323. Noting its conclusion that SSA would have violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute if it had granted NTEU access, the Authority held that, in this case, the Statute mandated that NTEU's non-employee organizers be treated differently than the non-labor organizations to which SSA had granted access. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the Authority concluded that there had been no illegal discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b. <span class="Italic">The D.C. Circuit's Review of the Authority's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, the court found that by interpreting section 7116(a)(3) as a bar to SSA permitting NTEU to distribute literature on the sidewalks of the Woodlawn complex, the Authority had drawn the constitutionality of that section "seriously into question." 986 F.2d at 539. In this regard, the court referenced the district court's finding in <span class="Italic">King II</span> (also on appeal) that the sidewalks are a "public forum" and that SSA had abridged NTEU's First Amendment right of free speech<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">King II</span>, 798 F. Supp. at 788).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court directed the Authority to "consider the constitutional implications of its choice between permissible interpretations of the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> The court further stated that, although an agency is not obliged to adopt an interpretation that avoids a constitutional issue, the consequences of adopting one of several reasonable interpretations without regard to the constitutional question presented could be "most untoward<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 540.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the court noted that the outside areas at Woodlawn, which SSA administers pursuant to the delegation order from GSA but does not lease for its own purposes, may not constitute "[SSA's] facilities" within the scope of section 7116(a)(3)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 540. According to the court, if these areas are not SSA's facilities, then SSA would presumably not be liable under the Statute because it would not be acting as employer, but rather as "GSA's building manager<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> The court remanded the case to the Authority to determine whether Woodlawn's "public areas" are "[SSA's] facilities" for the purposes of that section of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court's remand requires the Authority to examine, within the context of this case, the meaning and purpose of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. In conducting this analysis, we start with the wording of section 7116(a)(3), trace its evolution, review administrative and judicial precedent interpreting both this section and its predecessor under Executive Order 11491, and set out what we believe to be the meaning and purpose of the section. As a result of this examination, we establish a revised analytical framework for evaluating cases arising under section 7116(a)(3). In applying this framework, we conclude that SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(3) as alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We then review the purpose and meaning of section 7116(a)(1) in the context of non-employee organizers being denied access to agency premises and establish an analytical framework for evaluating such cases. Having adopted this framework, we apply it and conclude that SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(1) in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute Prohibits an Agency from Sponsoring, Controlling, or Assisting a Labor Organization</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Terms and Origin of Section 7116(a)(3)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Resolution of the meaning of a statutory provision "begins where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute itself." <span class="Italic">United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.</span>, 489 U.S. 235, 241 (1989) (citation omitted). Section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute makes it a ULP for an agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">to sponsor, control, or otherwise assist any labor organization, other than to furnish, upon request, customary and routine services and facilities if the services and facilities are also furnished on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As plainly worded, section 7116(a)(3) expresses both a broad prohibition and an exception thereto: first, it prohibits specified improper relationships between agencies and labor organizations; and second, it clarifies that the furnishing of routine services and facilities under certain circumstances is not included within the broad prohibition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_155"></span>The legislative history pertaining to section 7116(a)(3) sheds little light on what Congress intended. In this regard, there is only a brief example, in the House Report, of permissible assistance under the section--"providing equal bulletin board space to two labor organizations which will be on the ballot in an exclusive representation election[.]" H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 49 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Subcomm. on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span>, at 695. Consistent with this example, affording equal treatment to two unions in an election context would not equate to sponsorship, control, or assistance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language enacted by Congress is patterned after Section 19(a)(3) of Executive Order 11491 (1969) (the Order), which governed federal sector labor relations prior to the passage of the Statute.[5] Under section 19(a)(3), it was an unfair labor practice for an agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">to sponsor, control, or otherwise assist a labor organization, except that an agency may furnish customary and routine services and facilities under section 23 [6] of this Order when consistent with the best interests of the agency, its employees, and the organization and when the services and facilities are furnished, if requested, on an impartial basis to organizations having equivalent status [7]....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Section 19(a)(3) of the Order evolved from section 3.2(a)(3) of the Code of Fair Labor Practices, 3 C.F.R. 1959-63.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Section 23 of the Order required agencies to take appropriate steps to implement the Order, including developing policies concerning the use of agency facilities by labor organizations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;At the time of the issuance of the Order, the phrase "equivalent status" was not specifically defined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Interpretations of this provision have played a significant role in establishing how section 7116(a)(3) has come to be understood.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Administrative and Judicial Precedent under the Executive Order and the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A decision of the Assistant Secretary for Labor Management Relations (ASLMR) interpreting Section 19(a)(3) of the Order led to the Authority's construction of section 7116(a)(3) in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span> as an absolute bar to allowing rival unions lacking equivalent status access to agency facilities. In justifying his decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, U.S. Army Natick Laboratories, Natick, Mass.</span>, 3 A/SLMR 194 (1973) (<span class="Italic">Natick</span>), the ASLMR utilized broad language to explain the result reached. This language, quoted below, has been applied by the Authority to address situations different from those presented in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>; additionally, this language has been cited with approval by both the Authority and the United States of Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interpretations of Section 19(a)(3) of the Executive Order</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Natick</span>, three non-employee representatives of AFGE were allowed access to an agency's premises for the purpose of conducting an organizational campaign. At the time, the agency was negotiating a new agreement with its exclusive representative, a local of the National Association of Government Employees. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that section 19(a)(3) of the Order did not prohibit the agency from allowing access to rival unions lacking equivalent status so long as the agency did not display favoritism toward either union. In the ALJ's view, by granting temporary access on terms equivalent to the incumbent, the agency did not, in and of itself, sponsor, control, or assist. 3 A/SLMR at 206.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review, the ASLMR disagreed, concluding that absent equivalent status, an agency may not furnish a rival with the use of its services and facilities. "To hold otherwise would...grant to an agency or activity the power to pick and choose the particular rival labor organization it desires to unseat an incumbent." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 196. In making this statement, the ASLMR did not address whether the prohibition against sponsorship, control, or assistance, or the proviso in section 19(a)(3) (requiring the furnishing of facilities on an impartial basis) could operate to prevent such partiality by an agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ASLMR also noted that an agency could jeopardize the stability of labor-management relations by "using as leverage in the bargaining relationship the power to permit representatives of a rival labor organization on its premises at any time." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In raising this concern, the ASLMR did not analyze whether such agency conduct would otherwise be an unfair labor practice for, by example, failing to negotiate in good faith as required by sections 19(a)(6) and 11(a) of the Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ASLMR went on to note, however, that under section 19(a)(3) of the Order, such non-employee representatives may be furnished agency facilities or services "where it can be established that the employees involved are inaccessible to reasonable attempts by the labor organization to communicate with them outside the agency's or activity's premises." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This limited exception was premised upon section 1(a) of the Order which was the forerunner of section 7102 of the Statute, and protected, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the rights of employees to "form, join, or assist a labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity....<span class="Italic">" Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Natick</span> rationale was only once subjected to direct review by the Federal Labor Relations Council (FLRC).[8] <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base, Peru, Indiana and Local 1434, NFFE and Local 3254, AFGE</span>, 6 FLRC 407 (1978) (<span class="Italic">Grissom</span>). In <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, the agency had not taken steps to prevent the publication of a paid advertisement by a rival union in a newspaper over which, although privately owned and published, the agency exercised some control. 6 FLRC at 408. The ASLMR found that the paper was, in effect, "an instrumentality of [the base]," and ruled that a ULP had occurred. <span class="Italic">Local 3254, American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 7 A/SLMR 486, 487 (1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Under section 4 of the Order, the FLRC was authorized, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to act on appeals from decisions of the ASLMR.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Council reversed.&#x2003;Rejecting the approach followed by the ASLMR, the Council found that the agency management took no affirmative action in the case and therefore had not offered improper assistance or control in violation of the Order in this case. In reaching the conclusion that the ASLMR's finding was inconsistent with the history and purposes of section 19(a)(3), the Council concluded that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 19(a)(3) was clearly intended...to prevent agency management from dominating or controlling a labor organization by contributing financial or other support to it and to preserve the independence of such organizations from agency manipulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, 6 FLRC at 411-12.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority's Interpretation of Section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the Authority's consideration of the case now before us (<span class="Italic">Social Sec. Admin.</span>), the Authority had not directly considered an unfair labor practice case where a rival, lacking equivalent status, sought and was denied access to agency facilities.[9] However, in a limited number of cases, the Authority has considered the issue of access to agency premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;In one case, the Authority left undisturbed the unchallenged finding of an ALJ that an agency committed a ULP when it permitted a rival union, lacking equivalent status, access to a "public use area" near some vending machines outside the employee cafeteria. <span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, New Mexico and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1749 and Laborer's International Union of North America, Navajo Area Health Care Employees, Local Union 1376</span>, 44 FLRA 217 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Medical Center</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the Authority addressed an agency's obligations under the Statute when a rival union sought to solicit on GSA-owned public areas adjacent to the agency's premises. In <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Serv., Health Care Financing Admin. and American Federation of Government Employees and National Treasury Employee's Union</span>, 24 FLRA 672, 676 (1986) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>), the Authority analyzed whether the agency had exercised control over such public areas. Where GSA had control over the public space, the Authority determined that the agency had no obligation to prohibit the rival union, lacking equivalent status, from entering the agency's public areas.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;On the other hand, in the case now before us, where SSA, the employing agency, rather than GSA had control of the permit process, the Authority ruled that the agency properly denied access to the rival union lacking equivalent status. <span class="Italic">Social Sec. Admin.</span>, 45 FLRA at 318.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shortly after <span class="Italic">Social Sec. Admin.</span>, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Barksdale Air Force Base, Bossier City, Louisiana and NFFE, Local 1953</span>, 45 FLRA 659 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Barksdale Air Force Base</span>), the Authority was presented with another case where an agency had granted a rival union, lacking equivalent status, access to its premises for the purpose of conducting an organizational campaign. However, in concluding that the agency had violated section 7116(a)(3), the only issue considered by the Authority in that case involved the adequacy of alternative methods of communication available to the rival union. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 665.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, a review of Authority precedent reveals that it was not until <span class="Italic">Social Sec. Admin.</span> that the Authority directly applied the <span class="Italic">Natick</span> rationale to conclude that an agency properly denied access to agency premises to a rival labor organization lacking equivalent status because section 7116(a)(3) prohibits an agency from granting such access.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judicial Review Involving Section 7116(a)(3)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has quoted the <span class="Italic">Natick</span> rationale in several cases. However, the court has not specifically considered whether the <span class="Italic">Natick</span> approach would, in circumstances other than those where the employees are otherwise inaccessible, prohibit an agency from granting access to its routine facilities and services to a rival union lacking equivalent status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, the court has cited <span class="Italic">Natick</span> and noted that the law was settled, under both the Executive Order and the Statute, "that an <span id="page_156"></span>agency generally may not provide access to or use of its facilities to any labor organization without 'equivalent status.'" <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 333, 336-37 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>). However, whether an agency could, in light of section 7116(a)(3) ever permit such access, was not at issue in that case: The court stated in this respect that it was "<span class="Italic">undisputed</span> that, under the circumstances presented, the Agency could not lawfully permit use of or grant access to the nonpublic areas of its facilities to any union other than AFGE, the exclusive representative of its employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 334 (emphasis added).[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;The issue in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> was whether the agency was obliged to prevent a rival union from using GSA-controlled areas contiguous to the agency's premises. 793 F.2d at 334. In order to resolve this issue, the Court remanded to the Authority the question of whether the agency or GSA controlled the use of the public areas<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 338. On remand, the Authority determined that GSA had "exclusive jurisdiction...to grant permits for the use of [the] public space" and that the agency did not have control over the public areas in question. <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, 24 FLRA at 676. The Authority further found that it had not been established that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) had influenced GSA's control over the public spaces in question and that in the absence of control or influence, HCFA had no affirmative duty to persuade GSA to deny NTEU access to the public space. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The D.C. Circuit affirmed the Authority, noting that the FPMRs "did not give HCFA authority to exclude the rival union's representatives from the adjacent public areas" and that "HCFA did not in fact exercise control over the areas." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 947, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, wherein the court reviewed the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, the <span class="Italic">Natick</span> decision was referenced but not specifically analyzed. The D.C. Circuit quoted from the language of <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>: "[B]ut for the question of GSA involvement, there would be no doubt that permitting [a rival union lacking equivalent status] into the [public areas] in question (whether or not into the actual work areas) would constitute unlawful assistance." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d at 540, (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, 793 F.2d at 337).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the D.C. Circuit has also indicated its agreement with the rationale articulated by the FLRC in <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>: "[T]he provision [section 7116(a)(3)] is aimed primarily at preventing agency domination of unions and preserving the bargaining representative's independence...[citation to <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> omitted]. Like its analogue in private sector labor law, &#x00A7; 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158(a)(2) (1982), it is directed at the problem of 'company unions.'" <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, 840 F.2d at 955-56.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, like the Authority, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has cited the <span class="Italic">Natick</span> decision; however, the Court has always presumed, without specifically addressing and deciding, that an agency would violate section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute if it allowed a rival union, lacking equivalent status, access to its customary and routine services and facilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7116(a)(3) Prohibits Sponsoring, Controlling, or Assisting a Labor Organization</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The wording and structure of section 7116(a)(3), the Executive Order provision from which it evolved, as well as administrative and judicial precedent discussing both provisions, lead us to conclude, in agreement with the FLRC and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, that the purpose of section 7116(a)(3) is contained in the first clause of the section--agencies may not sponsor, control, or assist labor organizations. This fundamental objective guides our interpretation of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second clause of section 7116(a)(3) helps to define the meaning of sponsorship, control, and assistance and to prevent overbroad and impractical interpretations of the first phrase of the section. For example, standing alone, the first clause of the section could be construed to prevent an agency from providing even a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> routine service or facility to a labor organization. However, the potential for such a sweeping and unwieldy interpretation is avoided by the second clause of the section, which permits agencies to furnish routine services and facilities to labor organizations, even if the provision of such services and facilities would otherwise constitute sponsorship, control, and assistance, so long as the services and facilities in question are furnished on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status. The second clause of section 7116(a)(3) thus limits the reach of the first and specifically excepts certain activities from the potentially broad prohibitions of the first, or, as the FLRC concluded, it "is a proviso to the otherwise absolute ban." <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, 6 FLRC at 411 n.8. Read as a whole, section 7116(a)(3) prohibits sponsorship, control, and assistance, but permits the furnishing of customary and routine services and facilities on an impartial basis to labor organizations having equivalent status.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Revised Framework for Analyzing Claims Alleging Violations of Section 7116(a)(3)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that section 7116(a)(3) prohibits sponsorship, control, and assistance, while allowing the furnishing of customary and routine services on an impartial basis, we herein establish a revised framework for analyzing cases arising under this section. In adopting this framework, we first establish the central question that must be analyzed in section 7116(a)(3) cases and then set out and discuss the sources we have considered in forming our view of sponsorship, control, and assistance under the Statute. Finally, we summarize the framework we adopt and briefly describe an agency's obligations under section 7116(a)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the revised framework for evaluating cases arising under section 7116(a)(3) which we adopt today is, in some respects, a departure from the manner in which the broad <span class="Italic">Natick</span> language was interpreted in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>. We also appreciate that in other cases, previously cited in this decision, the broad <span class="Italic">Natick</span> language has been applied by the Authority and cited by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. However, the inflexible <span class="Italic">Natick</span> approach, as applied and interpreted in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, is practically unworkable in certain circumstances and fails to contemplate the potential for constitutional challenges such as have arisen in the case before us. As a result we are obliged to revisit and revise how section 7116(a)(3) cases should be analyzed. Having done so, we believe, for the reasons explained below, that unlike the broad and rigid <span class="Italic">Natick</span> approach, this revised interpretation is squarely in accord with the terminology, purpose, and meaning of section 7116(a)(3). We also find that this approach will best effectuate the purposes of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Central Question to be Analyzed</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proper central question in section 7116(a)(3) cases is whether the agency action--in this case the denial of access to agency premises--sponsored, controlled, or assisted a labor organization. The analytical approach employed in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, which asks only whether a labor organization has equivalent status, is flawed because it ignores the primary purpose of section 7116(a)(3) by failing to analyze whether the agency has sponsored, controlled, or assisted a labor organization. The <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span> approach applies a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that granting access to a rival lacking equivalent status <span class="Italic">always</span> equates to sponsorship, control, or assistance. Such an approach inverts the section by allowing the exception to the broad prohibition to define an agency's obligations under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Revising and stating the central question in this way means that we will no longer construe the second clause of section 7116(a)(3) as absolutely defining the limits of what an agency is permitted to do <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> its services and facilities. As a result, an agency will not be automatically obliged by the Authority's interpretation of section 7116(a)(3) to require as a condition to furnishing routine services and facilities, including access to agency premises, that a rival labor organization have obtained equivalent status to an incumbent,[13] without regard to whether the provision of such services and facilities, in and of itself, sponsors, controls, or assists a labor organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;On the other hand, the adoption of the revised framework described herein should not be construed as altering an agency's obligations to a rival union once the rival has obtained "equivalent status." <span class="Italic">See DOD, Dependents School</span>, 44 FLRA 419.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sources that Define and Explain Sponsorship, Control and Assistance</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our view of what constitutes sponsorship, control, and assistance is informed by several sources and considerations. First, we look to and examine an analogous provision of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), as well as the applicable precedent interpreting this provision. However, in analyzing private sector law, we note several important distinctions concerning the context in which private and federal sector cases have arisen. We also consider precedent developed under the Statute and the Executive Order as well as the language of the proviso. Lastly, we take into account the interrelationship between section 7116(a)(3) and section 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted earlier, the primary purpose of both section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute and section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA is to prevent "company unionism." <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, 840 F.2d at 955-56; <span class="Italic">see also, e.g.</span>, Remarks of Senator Wagner, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1 <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the National Labor Relations Act</span>, 1935, at 15-16 (1949). However, in attacking the same evil, the statutes use somewhat different language. Section 7116(a)(3) proscribes sponsorship, control or assistance, while section 8(a)(2) makes it illegal:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">to dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite this difference in phraseology, the prohibitions in section 8(a)(2) are comparable with the proscriptions in section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. Specifically, both statutes forbid an employer's unduly influencing a labor organization: section 8(a)(2) by use of the word "domination," and section 7116(a)(3) through the word "control." Similarly, both statutes <span id="page_157"></span>prohibit an employer from improperly supporting and fostering a labor organization: section 8(a)(2) through phrases that outlaw "interfer[ing] with the formation or administration...[and] contribut[ing] financial or other support" and section 7116(a)(3) by use of the terms "sponsor" and "assist."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finding that the purposes and prohibitions of the two sections are analogous, we will consider judicial and administrative precedent interpreting section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA in construing section 7116(a)(3)'s prohibition against sponsorship, control, or assistance. In this regard, we note that the Supreme Court has determined that, in evaluating allegations of improper employer activity under section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is to examine the totality of circumstances (<span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists, etc. v. NLRB</span>, 311 U.S. 72, 80 (1940)) in determining whether the employer's action has interfered with employee freedom of choice (<span class="Italic">NLRB v. Link-Belt Co.</span>, 311 U.S. 584, 588 (1941)). Bearing in mind that the purpose of both section 8(a)(2) and section 7116(a)(3) is to prevent "company unions" and to preserve the bargaining unit representative's independence, we find the Supreme Court's guidance in section 8(a)(2) cases appropriate for analyzing allegations of sponsorship, control, and assistance under section 7116(a)(3). Accordingly, we will be examining whether, in the totality of circumstances, the employer interfered with employee freedom of choice by failing to maintain a proper arms-length relationship with the labor organization involved. Like the Board, we will avoid applying a <span class="Italic">per se</span> approach to the use of employer property and will decide each case on the totality of its facts. <span class="Italic">Coamo Knitting Mills, Inc.</span>, 150 NLRB 579, 582 (1964).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Federal Sector Considerations</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although considering private sector precedent to illuminate our interpretation of sponsorship, control, and assistance, we bear in mind an important distinction between the cases decided by the NLRB and those that have come before the Authority and its predecessor in the federal sector. The private sector standard was developed and has been most often applied in the context of an organizational campaign where there is no exclusive representative. Unlike the private sector, the federal experience in this and previous cases (<span class="Italic">Natick</span>, <span class="Italic">Grissom</span>, <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, <span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Medical Center</span>, <span class="Italic">Barksdale Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">etc.</span>) has almost always involved an attempt by a rival labor organization to unseat an incumbent that has already organized the workforce in question. There are, on the one hand, inherent and concrete benefits to incumbency, and, on the other, disadvantages to being a rival. These distinctions are not indicative of whether the agency has maintained the proper arms-length relationship with its employees' exclusive representative. For example, the incumbent, as a result of its status, already has access to the agency's premises and an established relationship with the agency. Moreover, the incumbent has an opportunity through collective bargaining to obtain other advantages (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, union offices, bulletin board space, use of agency mail systems, etc.) that a rival, regardless of equivalent status, will not have attained.[14] In our view, section 7116(a)(3)'s prohibition on sponsorship, control, and assistance is not designed to provide a rival labor organization, lacking equivalent status, the benefits that an incumbent has obtained as a result of both its status and its collective bargaining as the exclusive representative. Accordingly, our consideration of private sector precedent should not be read to suggest that an agency is obliged to grant access to a rival labor organization lacking equivalent status lest the agency be sanctioned for failing to maintain the proper arms-length relationship with its incumbent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;Moreover, even upon obtaining equivalent status, a rival is not entitled to benefits that an incumbent labor organization has obtained through collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Department of the Army, U.S. Army Air Defense Center and Fort Bliss, Texas and NFFE, Local 2068 and NAGE, Local R14-89</span>, 29 FLRA 362, 365-66 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the contrary, should an agency, whose employees are already represented, allow access to a rival labor organization lacking equivalent status, we would closely examine whether the agency had maintained the appropriate arms-length relationship with the rival. However, having in this decision revised the broad <span class="Italic">Natick</span> rule to accommodate a constitutional problem not envisioned by the ASLMR, we do not believe it prudent to broadly pronounce in this case that any agency grant of access to a rival lacking equivalent status will necessarily equate to sponsorship, control, or assistance. Instead, in establishing a revised framework, we set out specific instances of when grants of access to rivals lacking equivalent status will be permitted and, for other cases, offer guidance as to how we will evaluate sponsorship, control, or assistance. <span class="Italic">See</span> sections IV.B.4.a., b.(1), (3), and (4). Rather than prejudge cases perhaps premised upon factual scenarios we have not here envisioned, we leave for another day the determination of whether an agency, whose employees are already represented and who grants access to a rival labor organization lacking equivalent status, has sponsored, controlled, or assisted that labor organization and thus violated section 7116(a)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Precedent and the Proviso</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the precedent of the FLRC, the Authority, and the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, it is evident that an agency does not sponsor, control, or assist a labor organization that gains access to services or facilities over which an agency does not exercise control. In other words, lacking control, an agency is not obliged to take affirmative steps to deny such access<span class="Italic">. See Grissom</span>, <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>. In addition, consistent with <span class="Italic">Natick</span> and as further developed below, an agency does not sponsor, control, or assist in violation of the section 7116(a)(3) where it grants access to a rival lacking equivalent status that has no other means of communicating with the agency's employees outside of the agency's premises. 3 A/SLMR at 196. The Authority has adopted this rule as well. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration</span>; <span class="Italic">Barksdale Air Force Base</span>.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;For reasons expressed in section C, <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the question of other means of communicating with employees will henceforth be examined in the context of determining allegations under section 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proviso to section 7116(a)(3) further helps to define the meaning of sponsorship, control, or assistance. For example, if an agency were to grant a labor organization, other than the exclusive representative, access to services and facilities that were not routinely granted to others, this might well be indicative of sponsorship, control, or assistance.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;Similarly, the proviso's requirement that services and facilities be "furnished on an impartial basis" will also serve as a standard when an agency denies access to one labor organization that it has granted to another. In this regard, we would consider the NLRB's and judicial interpretations of section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA. <span class="Italic">See Davis Supermarkets, Inc.</span>, 306 NLRB 426, n.3 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Davis Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 2 F.3d 1162, 1178 (D.C. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1368 (1994); <span class="Italic">River Manor Health Facility</span>, 224 NLRB 227, 236 (1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interrelationship Between Section 7116(a)(3) and Section 7116(a)(1)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in defining sponsorship, control, or assistance, it is appropriate in our view to reconsider the interrelationship between section 7116(a)(3) and section 7116(a)(1). The Authority has noted the "tension between section 7116(a)(3) and section 7116(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 324. However, in holding that SSA was obliged to deny NTEU access to its premises because to do otherwise would violate section 7116(a)(3), the Authority previously concluded that section 7116(a)(3), in effect, trumped section 7116(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 323. As developed in section C., <span class="Italic">infra</span>, pursuant to section 7116(a)(1), an agency is required, <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> non-employee solicitation on its premises, to consider the availability of other means of communication and to maintain a non-discrimination policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's previous construction of the interrelation between these two provisions in the Statute failed to address constitutional problems such as those that confronted the Respondent in this case. In addition, it ignored that the underpinning of the <span class="Italic">Natick</span> exception was premised upon the employees' right to form, join, or assist a labor organization, which is effectuated through section 7116(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> note 23, <span class="Italic">infra</span>. Accordingly, we reassess the interplay between these sections of the Statute in light of our view of the purpose of section 7116(a)(3) as developed above and section 7116(a)(1) as developed <span class="Italic">infra</span>. We conclude that section 7116(a)(3)'s ban on assistance is not violated by action required to comply with section 7116(a)(1)'s prohibition on discrimination and right to communication. Specifically, an agency that grants access to its services or facilities to a labor organization lacking equivalent status, because to do otherwise would require it to violate section 7116(a)(1), does not, <span class="Italic">ipso facto</span>, violate section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. Conversely, where denial of access violates section 7116(a)(1), the agency's violation will not be excused on the ground that granting access would have violated section 7116(a)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Framework Summary</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an agency is charged with violating section 7116(a)(3) by granting or denying access to services and facilities over which the agency exercises control, we will henceforth analyze whether the agency action has sponsored, controlled, or assisted a labor organization. In making this determination, we will analyze whether the agency has, in the totality of circumstances, interfered with employee freedom of choice by failing to maintain the appropriate arms-length relationship with the labor organization involved. We will be guided in this determination by considering the wording of section 7116(a)(3) as well as our own case law and precedent interpreting section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This revised analysis does not alter the principle that where an agency's employees are already represented by an exclusive representative, an agency will nevertheless be obliged to grant access to a labor organization that obtains equivalent status. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dependents School</span>. Nor does it ignore the special status of an exclusive representative. However, <span id="page_158"></span>even if a rival labor organization has not obtained equivalent status, an agency will be obliged to grant access when to do otherwise would violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Analytical Framework to the Denial of Access in this Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously determined that SSA would have violated section 7116(a)(3) had it granted NTEU's request for permission to distribute literature on Woodlawn's public areas. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 320. As a result, the Authority concluded that SSA had not, in denying NTEU a permit, unlawfully assisted AFGE in violation of section 7116(a)(3). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 321. We have concluded that an agency--in this case SSA--is not obliged, pursuant to section 7116(a)(3), to deny access to a labor organization lacking equivalent status--here NTEU--unless the grant of such access would equate to sponsorship, control, or assistance. We now evaluate whether SSA, in denying NTEU access, unlawfully assisted AFGE as alleged in the complaint prosecuted by the General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the denial of access to NTEU did not amount to unlawful assistance to AFGE. First, we find that SSA exercised control over the premises to which access was denied. We recognize that if NTEU, a rival labor organization, had been granted a permit to distribute literature on agency premises, AFGE's status as an incumbent may have been subjected to potential challenges by NTEU. However, such a denial would inure to the benefit of an incumbent whenever there is an exclusive representative and, as we noted in the preceding section, there are certain advantages that go with incumbency. We conclude that the denial of access to a rival, in and of itself, does not equate to sponsorship, control, or assistance to the incumbent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, on examination of the record in this case, in light of the totality of circumstances, there is no evidence that through this denial of access SSA interfered with its employees' freedom of choice or failed to maintain the proper arms-length relationship with AFGE. Although it is conceivable that the denial of access could result in an incumbent becoming a "company union," as one court noted in a related context, "[i]t is not the potential for but the reality of domination that these statutes are intended to prevent." <span class="Italic">Barthelemy v. Air Line Pilots Association</span>, 897 F.2d 999, 1016 (9th Cir. 1990). In scrutinizing the stipulations of the parties and examining the record, we find no evidence that SSA's action unlawfully assisted AFGE. For example, there is no evidence that AFGE is either controlled by SSA or is anything other than an independent representative of the bargaining unit. Nor is there evidence that the denial was viewed by the employees as indicative of the agency favoring AFGE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that, in denying NTEU's permit request, SSA did not sponsor, control, or assist AFGE, we dismiss the complaint as it relates to section 7116(a)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA's Claim That It Was Obliged to Deny NTEU a Permit Because Granting the Request Would Have Violated Section 7116(a)(3)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted earlier, the Authority previously accepted SSA's claim that had it granted the permit sought, the agency would have violated section 7116(a)(3) by improperly assisting NTEU. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 320. In view of our conclusion in the preceding section, an analysis of this affirmative defense is unnecessary for resolution of the section 7116(a)(3) charge. However, we note our determination in section 4, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that an agency's denial of access to non-employee organizers of labor organizations, lacking equivalent status, will be analyzed in light of the agency's obligations under section 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">7.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Constitutional Dilemma and the Facilities Question</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The adoption of this revised framework is responsive to the D.C. Circuit's concern that the Authority avoid an interpretation of the Statute that raises constitutional implications for access cases arising under section 7116(a)(3). <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d at 540. "[M]indful of the first amendment implications," our determination in this case resolves the predicament faced by SSA<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Under the Authority's previous interpretation of section 7116(a)(3), SSA's compliance with its obligations under the Statute prompted a successful district court constitutional challenge against the agency by NTEU. <span class="Italic">King II</span>, 798 F. Supp. 780. Under the revised interpretation and framework, an agency will no longer be automatically obliged to deny such access.[18] Thus, the Authority's interpretation and application of section 7116(a)(3) will not require an agency to deny access and prompt constitutional access challenges, like the one asserted in this case, that are premised upon an agency's compliance with its obligations under the Statute. As such, and as directed by the Court, our decision enables agencies to avoid a First Amendment challenge in carrying out their obligations under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;Moreover an agency will be required to grant access if denial would violate section 7116(a)(1).<span class="Italic"> See </span>section 4, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The analytical framework adopted and applied herein avoids an interpretation of the Statute that leads to uncertain constitutional implications.&#x2003;As a result, it is unnecessary to address the issue, raised by the court in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, of whether the sidewalks were the "facilities" of SSA as this question relates to whether SSA was acting as GSA's building manager rather than as an employer. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>[19]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;We recognize that resolution of the facilities question, either in the manner suggested by the court, or by our concurring colleague, could arguably be a limited basis upon which to adjudicate this case. However, where the agency itself (rather than GSA) controls and owns the premises to which access is sought, the agency's status as a building manager would not be dispositive, and an agency would find itself in the same precarious position that faced SSA here. Similarly, reliance upon the fact that this case involves external sidewalks does not address what rule would apply in a case involving internal agency premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7116(a)(1)--Employee Rights When Non-employee Organizers Seek Access to Agency Premises</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel has alleged that, in the circumstances of this case, the denial of access to NTEU violated section 7116(a)(1). In support of this assertion, the General Counsel claims that employees have a right under section 7116(a)(1) to receive information about other labor organizations from non-employee organizers and that SSA has a discriminatory policy concerning access to its premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question of whether section 7116(a)(1) extends derivative section 7102 rights to non-employee organizers has not been previously decided by the Authority.[20] In interpreting section 7116(a)(1), and thereby determining an agency's obligations under the Statute <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> requests for access from non-employee organizers, we are guided by germane decisions of the Supreme Court, discussed below, interpreting analogous provisions of the NLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;In this case, as noted earlier herein, rather than decide this issue the Authority assumed that any derivative right of access to agency premises possessed by non-employee organizers was overcome by the requirement of section 7116(a)(3) that such access be denied to a labor organization lacking equivalent status. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 324.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The wording and purposes of section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA and section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute are virtually identical. Both prohibit interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under the respective statutes.[21] In line with our earlier determination concerning section 8(a)(2) and section 7116(a)(3) (Section IV.B.4.b.(1), <span class="Italic">supra</span>), we find that the similarities between these sections justify our consideration of judicial and administrative precedent interpreting section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA in construing section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;The only dissimilarity between the two sections is that the rights referenced in section 8 are those in section 7 of the NLRA; in section 7116(a)(1), the rights protected are those set out in Chapter 71 of Title 5. However, for the purposes of this analysis, this is a distinction without a difference because the organizational rights found in section 7--"form, join, or assist labor organizations"--are contained in section 7102 of the Statute as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox Co.</span>, 351 U.S. 105 (1956) (<span class="Italic">Babcock</span>), the Supreme Court articulated an employer's obligations under section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA when non-employee union organizers seek access to employees on company property. The Court determined that "an employer may validly post his property against non-employee distribution of union literature" if two conditions are present<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 112. First, the union must be able "through other available channels of communication...to reach the employees with its message" and second, "the employer's...order does not discriminate against the union by allowing other distribution<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> However, if either of these circumstances is not met, "non-employee union organizers may have a limited right of access to an employer's premises for the purpose of engaging in organization solicitation." <span class="Italic">Sears, Roebuck, and Co. v. San Diego County District Council of Carpenters</span>, 436 U.S. 180, 204 (1978) (<span class="Italic">Sears, Roebuck</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 502 U.S. 527, 532 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Lechmere</span>), the Court reaffirmed its earlier decision, noting that even though "the NLRA confers rights only on <span class="Italic">employees</span>, not on unions or their non-employee organizers," <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> had recognized that employees have the right to "learn the advantages of self-organization from others." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">quoting Babcock</span>, 351 U.S. at 113. The <span class="Italic">Lechmere</span> decision further noted that the non-employee union organizers bear the burden of showing that the employer's access rules discriminate against union solicitation or that no other reasonable means of communication exist<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 532, 535 (<span class="Italic">quoting Sears, Roebuck,</span> 436 U.S. at 205).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Framework for Analyzing Alleged Violations of Section 7116(a)(1) Where Non-employee Organizers Seek Access</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accord with Supreme Court precedent interpreting section 8(a)(1), we conclude that under certain circumstances employees have a right, on <span id="page_159"></span>agency property, to "learn the advantages" of labor organizations from non-employee organizers, pursuant to section 7116(a)(1) and section 7102. We recognize that <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> and its progeny have most often been applied in the context of an organizational campaign where, unlike the case before us, the employees being solicited are not already represented by a labor organization. However, as noted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, even where the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> test does not precisely fit a set of facts, the principles stated in that case "must be an important starting point for analysis of any solicitation activity by non-employees." <span class="Italic">Montgomery Ward &#x0026; Co., Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 692 F.2d 1115, 1124-25 (7th Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 461 U.S. 914 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore adopt the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> analytical framework as our starting point in section 7116(a)(1) cases where non-employee labor organizers are denied access to agency premises. In performing this analysis, we will consider whether the agency has a non-discriminatory distribution policy and whether there are other reasonable means available to the labor organization for communicating its message to employees. If the General Counsel establishes either that an agency maintains a discriminatory policy, or, irrespective of the agency's access policy, that there are no other reasonable methods of communicating with the employees concerned, we will find that the agency has, in denying access to the non-employee organizers, violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Non-Discriminatory Policy Concerning Solicitation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that an employer has banned non-employee union solicitation, but allowed other outsiders access to its premises, does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the employer violated the non-discrimination provision set out in <span class="Italic">Babcock</span>. To the contrary, the NLRB and the United States Courts of Appeals, in reviewing determinations of the Board, have clarified the application of the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> non-discrimination rule in several respects. Because we have noted the similarity between section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA and section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute and adopted the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> analytical framework, we briefly review relevant decisions of the NLRB and examine how the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> non-discrimination rule has been analyzed and fashioned on review in the courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NLRB has long recognized "that an employer does not violate Sec. 8(a)(1) by permitting a small number of isolated 'beneficent acts' as narrow exceptions to a no-solicitation rule." <span class="Italic">Hammary Mfg. Corp.</span>, 265 NLRB 57 n.4 (1982) (<span class="Italic">Hammary</span>) (<span class="Italic">citing Serv-Air, Inc.</span>, 175 NLRB 801 (1969)). In this regard, "rather than finding an exception for charities to be a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Act, the Board has evaluated the 'quantum of...incidents' involved to determine whether unlawful discrimination has occurred." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Additionally, the Board permits an employer to deny non-employee organizers access to its premises while permitting other solicitations that are integrally related to the employer's business functions and purposes. <span class="Italic">Rochester General Hospital</span>, 234 NLRB 253 (1978). However, these two exceptions aside, the Board has interpreted and applied the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> non-discrimination rule to find a violation of section 8(a)(1) where an employer denies activity by non-employee organizers that it grants to others. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Be-Lo Stores</span>, 318 NLRB 1 (1995) (finding violation where employer enforced no-solicitation rule to deny picketing, but permitted various other religious, political, and charitable organizations to distribute literature and solicit on its premises).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NLRB's interpretation and application of <span class="Italic">Babcock</span>'s non-discrimination rule has been reviewed by several United States Courts of Appeals. In some instances, the Board's rule has been cited with approval on review and its application affirmed. <span class="Italic">See Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Standford v. NLRB</span>, 97 F.3d 583, 587-89 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (applying the Board's exceptions to the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> non-discrimination rule and agreeing with the Board's finding that 8(a)(1) was violated where an employer's policy restricting solicitation had been inconsistently exercised to prevent non-employee union organizers access, while permitting similar access to various commercial solicitors). On the other hand, in related factual contexts, Board orders have not been enforced when the courts have more narrowly restricted the activities and entities against which discrimination can be measured. <span class="Italic">See Guardian Industries Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 49 F.3d 317, 321-22 (7th Cir. 1995), (rejecting NLRB's finding of an 8(a)(1) violation premised upon an employer's refusal to permit the posting of union notices on the firm's bulletin board, while allowing swap-and-shop notices); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Southern Maryland Hospital Center</span>, 916 F.2d 932, 937-38 (4th Cir. 1990), (refusing to enforce the Board's finding that hospital discriminatorily enforced its no-solicitation policy by allowing numerous friends and relatives of hospital employees into the cafeteria while keeping union organizers out).[22]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently reviewed and rejected an NLRB decision finding that an employer had violated section 8(a)(1) by prohibiting non-employees from distributing union handbills outside of a shopping center. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Real Estate Partners v. NLRB</span>, 95 F.3d 457 (6th Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">CREP</span>). In reaching its conclusion, the Board had relied on the fact that the employer had previously allowed the Salvation Army, the Girl Scouts, the Boy Scouts, the Knights of Columbus, and others to solicit on the premises. Rejecting the NLRB's interpretation of Supreme Court precedent, the Court held "that the term 'discrimination' as used in <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> means favoring one union over another, or allowing employer-related information while barring similar union-related information." <span class="Italic">CREP</span>, 95 F.3d at 465.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Availability of Other Means of Communication</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ability of a labor organization to obtain access to employees through other methods of communication has previously been analyzed by both the ASLMR and the Authority in evaluating cases arising under section 19(a)(3) of the Order and section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute, respectively.<span class="Italic"> See Natick</span>, 3 A/SLMR at 196; <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 320; <span class="Italic">Barksdale Air Force Base</span>, 45 FLRA at 665. In view of our adoption of the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> analytical framework for analyzing cases arising under the Statute, we will apply that precedent, and, where appropriate, private sector precedent, in analyzing this issue in cases arising under section 7116(a)(1).[23]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;This is consistent with the ASLMR's determination in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>. As noted earlier herein, the ASLMR's determination that non-employee organizers were entitled to access if there was no other alternative means of communication was premised upon the rights assured employees in section 1(a) of the Order. 3 A/SLMR at 196. That section, like section 7102 of the Statute, recognized, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the right of employees "to form, join, or assist a labor organization, or to refrain from such activity...." Section 1(a) of the Order and section 7102 of the Statute were and are enforceable through identical provisions in section 19(a)(1) of the Order and section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute declaring it an unfair labor practice "to interfere with, restrain, or coerce an employee in the exercise" of rights assured by the Order and the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Analytical Framework to this Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously determined that section 7116(a)(3) "required SSA to treat NTEU differently from other organizations." <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 323. As a result, in denying NTEU the permit request, the Authority concluded that SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(1). Having revised our view of an agency's obligations under section 7116(a)(3), we now reconsider our earlier determination concerning whether SSA violated section 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA's Solicitation Policy</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no doubt that SSA has differentiated among the organizations that it has allowed to solicit on its Woodlawn premises.&#x2003;The record reflects that although NTEU, a labor organization, was denied access to the Agency's premises, beneficent organizations such as the Disabled American Veterans, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and the American Legion have been granted occasional access to the Agency's premises. However, the record is silent as to whether any other organizations have sought, been granted, or been denied access to SSA's premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the principles set out in the NLRB's <span class="Italic">Hammary</span> decision, we are unable to conclude, based upon the stipulated record in this case, that SSA has violated the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> nondiscrimination rule. The stipulations reflect that between November 1989 and April 1991, SSA granted permits to four charitable and civic organizations to distribute various information and materials. However, it is not clear, from stipulations before us, whether other entities have been denied permits or, alternatively, whether every organization that sought a permit from SSA has been granted access. Moreover, the parties' arguments do not address whether the number of permits granted during the time period have been isolated and limited to a small number of beneficent organizations, as set out in the Board's <span class="Italic">Hammary</span> exception. As a result, we do not find that SSA's denial of access to NTEU, which occurred during the same time period that it granted occasional access to charitable organizations, violated the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> non-discrimination rule.[25]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25] Even if we were to conclude that SSA's denial of a permit to NTEU <span id="page_160"></span>was discriminatory because of the Agency's grant of access to others, we would not find a violation in this case. SSA's consistent defense in this case has been that the Agency would have violated section 7116(a)(3), as heretofore interpreted by the Authority, had it granted a rival, lacking equivalent status, access to its premises. The Authority accepted this defense, noting that the Authority's interpretation of section 7116(a)(3) "required SSA to treat NTEU differently from other organizations." <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 323. Under these circumstances, and in light of our adoption today of a revised framework for analyzing cases arising under both section 7116(a)(1) and 7116(a)(3), we would dismiss the charge in any event. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Retail, Wholesale &#x0026; Department Store Union v. NLRB</span>, 466 F.2d 380, 390 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (in determining whether to give retroactive effect to rules adopted in the course of agency adjudication, it is appropriate to consider, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the extent to which the party against whom the new rule is to be applied relied on the former); <span class="Italic">New England Telephone &#x0026; Telegraph Co. v. FCC</span>, 826 F.2d 1101, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("under certain circumstances, an agency may be prevented from applying a new policy retroactively to parties who detrimentally relied on the previous policy.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we have considered that NTEU is being treated differently than AFGE--the incumbent and exclusive representative of the employees of SSA. However, for the purposes of applying the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> discrimination principle in determining whether an agency has violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute, we do not believe that the access afforded an incumbent labor organization, which, as noted earlier has access to the employer's premises because of its status as the exclusive representative, is relevant or properly compared to the access afforded to other labor organizations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Availability of Other Means of Communicating with the Employees</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given our finding, in the preceding section, that SSA's policy concerning solicitation did not violate section 7116(a)(1), we turn to the issue of whether there were other means of communicating with the employees that were available to NTEU. In this regard, we note that the Authority previously determined, in the context of evaluating the alleged section 7116(a)(3) violation, that NTEU had failed to demonstrate "that SSA's Woodlawn employees are inaccessible outside the Woodlawn premises." <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA at 320. We have been presented with no evidence that would lead us to alter this conclusion on remand, nor are we aware of any reason why we should reach a different conclusion because this issue is now being considered under section 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that SSA did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by discriminating against NTEU while permitting other solicitation on its premises.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Woodlawn</span> controversy did not end with the 1997 FLRA decision. Attempting to sort out the labor issues, the D.C. Circuit concluded in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Callahan</span>, 139 F.3d 214, 217-20 (D.C. Cir. 1998), that FLRA must again consider the application of <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Babcock and Wilcox Co.</span>, 351 U.S. 105 (1956) (an employer may maintain a general policy of denying nonemployee solicitors access to its premises; it may not discriminate against union solicitors by granting access to solicitors for other organizations) in the federal sector:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon remand the FLRA took as its starting point the analytical framework set out by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox Co.</span>, 351 U.S. 105, 76 S. Ct. 679, 100 L. Ed. 975 (1956), for dealing with the union access issue as it arose under the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration and National Treasury Employees Union and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 52 FLRA 1159, at [1184-85] (1997). The FLRA recognized that the initial organizing campaigns generally analyzed in <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> and "its progeny" did not match the facts of the current case; purportedly applying the principles of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span>, however, the FLRA held that the SSA's denials of the NTEU's permit requests did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the FSLMRA because the NTEU failed to show that such denials discriminated against the NTEU. The Authority also held that the SSA had not, by denying the permit requests of the NTEU, assisted the AFGE in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3). The NTEU now petitions the court to review both aspects of that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;No. 97-1204</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NTEU does not challenge the Authority's adoption of the <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> framework. The Union does argue, however, that under that framework the SSA should be held to have discriminated against the NTEU and to have unlawfully assisted the incumbent AFGE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After stating that it was adopting the framework of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> and its progeny "as a starting point" for analysis, <span class="Italic">see</span> 52 FLRA 1159, at [1185], the FLRA described that framework as follows: In <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> the Supreme Court held that an employer subject to the NLRA may maintain a general policy of denying non-employee solicitors access to its premises; it may not discriminate against union solicitors, however, by granting access to solicitors for other types of organizations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 351 U.S. at 112, 76 S. Ct. at 684. The excluded "union has the burden of showing that...the employer's access rules discriminate against the union's solicitation." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Southern Maryland Hospital Center</span>, 916 F.2d 932, 936 (4th Cir. 1990) (quoting <span class="Italic">Sears Roebuck &#x0026; Co. v. San Diego County District Council of Carpenters</span>, 436 U.S. 180, 205, 98 S. Ct. 1745, 1761-62, 56 L. Ed.2d 209 (1978)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Labor Relations Board has created, and this court has approved, an exception to the general rule of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> for "isolated beneficent acts": An employer that has a no-solicitation rule but nonetheless grants access to a few charitable organizations does not thereby lose its right to exclude unions under its general rule against solicitation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hosp. v. NLRB</span>, 97 F.3d 583, 587 (D.C. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Hammary Mfg. Corp.</span>, 265 NLRB 57, 57 n.4 (1982). In deciding whether grants of access to charitable organizations fall within the "isolated beneficent acts" exception, the Board does not employ a <span class="Italic">per se</span> approach but rather looks at the "quantum of...incidents." <span class="Italic">Hammary</span>, 265 NLRB at 57 n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Stating that "[t]he NLRB's interpretation and application of <span class="Italic">Babcock</span>'s nondiscrimination rule has been reviewed by several United States Courts of Appeals," the FLRA then cited without analysis certain conflicting decisions applying <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span>. 52 FLRA 1159, at [1186]. From this descriptive exercise (or at least after it) the FLRA concluded that "[t]he principles articulated in the [cited] decisions suggest that '[b]y inviting the public to use an area of its property, the employer does not surrender its right to control the uses to which that area is put.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Baptist Medical System v. NLRB</span>, 876 F.2d 661, 664 (8th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the facts of this case, the Authority said there could be "no doubt that SSA has differentiated among the organizations that it has allowed to solicit"; specifically, while denying the NTEU's requests for permits, the SSA had granted permits to several "beneficent organizations" to solicit money or membership--including the Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 52 FLRA 1159, at [1188]. The FLRA found, however:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he record is silent as to whether any other [i.e., nonbeneficent] organizations have sought, been granted, or been denied access to SSA's premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...Moreover, the parties' arguments do not address whether the number of permits granted during the time period have been isolated and limited to a small number of beneficent organizations....&#8197;As a result, we do not find that SSA's denial of access to NTEU, which occurred during the same time period that it granted occasional access to charitable organizations, violated the <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> non-discrimination rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NTEU argues that upon the present facts the FLRA erred in finding no violation of the general rule of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span>. We agree. Under that rule, the SSA's denial of the NTEU's permit request while granting permits to other organizations would be unlawful discrimination unless the exception for isolated beneficent acts (or some other exception) applies. The predicate for the rule is lacking here, however: the SSA does not have a general no-solicitation policy. To the contrary, the agency administers its permit process pursuant to the Federal Property Management Regulations, by authority delegated from its landlord, the General Services Administration. The FPMR states that every application for a permit must be granted unless it is faulty in form or the proposed use falls into one of five specifically excluded categories. <span class="Italic">See</span> 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101-20.402(a) ("A permit shall be issued...within 10 working days following [the administering agency's] receipt of the completed applications"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 101-20.403(a) (the agency "shall disapprove any application...if" the proposed use is commercial, obscene, intended to influence judicial proceedings, interferes with government uses of the property, or violates the prohibition against political solicitation in 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 607).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the SSA does not have a general no-solicitation policy, <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> and its sequelae do not protect the SSA's denial of permits to the NTEU. Moreover, even if the SSA did have a general no-solicitation policy, we would have to fault the Authority for applying the isolated beneficent acts exception without examining the "quantum...of incidents" in which the SSA granted permits to beneficent organizations, as it should have done before finding that the SSA's prior "beneficent acts" were indeed "isolated." To the extent that the FLRA relies upon <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> and "its progeny," therefore, the Authority's interpretation of the case law is erroneous and we must reverse its decision based thereon.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis does not end here because the FLRA was not required to adopt the rule of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> in the first place; nor, having done so, was it required to adopt the NLRB's exception for isolated beneficent acts. It is possible that the Authority intended, by its summary statement of the case law secondary to <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span>, to articulate its own standard <span id="page_161"></span>under the FSLMRA, one more deferential to the federal agency employer than is the standard of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> to private employers. (Recall that the Authority had concluded that the cases "suggest that by inviting the public to use an area of its property, the employer does not surrender the right to control the use to which that area is put.") Such a standard might, for example, permit an agency employer to exclude union solicitors from its premises while allowing all (or almost all) manner of other groups to engage in solicitation pursuant to the FPMR. To the extent that the FLRA may have intended to create any such new standard, however, that standard raises a serious constitutional question, as we have previously pointed out in this very litigation, <span class="Italic">see NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d 537, 539-40 (D.C. Cir. 1993); it also lacks any grounding in the cases cited, and the Authority neither described it clearly enough nor explained its reasoning sufficiently to permit us to affirm its decision upon that basis. <span class="Italic">See SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S. Ct. 454, 459-60, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943) (holding that reviewing court may not affirm agency decision on basis of rationale agency itself did not adopt).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also held, as an alternative basis for its conclusion, that even if the SSA did discriminate against the NTEU the Authority would not apply the standard of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> retroactively to the actions of the SSA. Rather, the Authority would judge the SSA under the standard in place when the SSA denied the NTEU's applications for a permit to distribute leaflets. <span class="Italic">See </span>52 FLRA 1159, at [1189] n.25. The NTEU objects that the FLRA's concern with retroactivity is misplaced because the Union seeks only forward-looking relief, and in any case retroactive application of the new rule would be permissible under the case law of this circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the NTEU that the Authority's concern with retroactivity is unwarranted. If the Authority does conclude upon remand that the SSA engaged in an unfair labor practice, then the SSA will not be unfairly imposed upon by the relief to which the NTEU would be entitled. A declaration to the effect that an employer committed an unfair labor practice, when based upon a newly-adopted standard, is indeed retroactive but only in the way familiar to private sector labor law and indeed inherent in both administrative and common law adjudication. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Consolidated Freightways v. NLRB</span>, 892 F.2d 1052, 1058 (D.C. Cir. 1989) ("new rules announced in agency adjudications may be applied retroactively absent any 'manifest injustice'"); <span class="Italic">Daily News of Los Angeles v. NLRB,</span> 73 F.3d 406 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (upholding NLRB decision finding newspaper liable for unfair labor practice by overruling prior Board decision); 13A WRIGHT, MILLER &#x0026; COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE: JURISDICTION 2D &#x00A7; 3535 n.20 ("[o]rdinarily the litigants in the case producing a new rule of law are controlled by the new rule"). Indeed, the SSA does not even face potential liability for backpay or other material relief to which employers in both the public and the private sector are routinely exposed upon the basis of "retroactive" adjudication. To the extent that the FLRA, upon further reconsideration, adheres to the standard of <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span>, therefore, it may not decline to find a violation merely because it had not yet adopted that standard when the SSA denied the NTEU's requests for permits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we remand to the FLRA the question whether the SSA violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1); the Authority may either reaffirm its embrace of the <span class="Italic">Babcock &#x0026; Wilcox</span> standard and hold that the SSA discriminated against the NTEU in violation of that section, or it may adopt some other standard by which to judge the SSA's denial of permits to the NTEU. If the SSA violated the Act under whatever standard the FLRA adopts, however, then the Authority may not deny the NTEU a remedy on the ground that it must avoid retroactive lawmaking.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(3)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also held that the SSA's denial of permits to the NTEU did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3), which makes it an unfair labor practice for an employee to assist a labor union. According to the Authority "there are certain advantages that go with incumbency," and "denial of access to a rival, in and of itself, does not equate to sponsorship, control, or assistance to the incumbent"; nor was there any evidence that the SSA had "sponsor[ed], control[led], or assist[ed] AFGE" in any other way. 52 FLRA 1159, at [1181]. The NTEU objects that the AFGE did benefit--in the form of enhanced prospects for re-election--from the disadvantage the NTEU incurred in being denied access to the grounds of the SSA, and because the denials of the permits were unlawful, the advantage gained by the AFGE was a fortiori unlawful assistance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA approached this issue, reasonably we think, by asking the functional question whether the employer "interfered with employee freedom of choice by failing to maintain the appropriate arms-length relationship with the labor organization involved." 52 FLRA 1159, at [1180]. Answering the question by reference to the totality of the circumstances, the Authority concluded that the advantage the SSA indirectly conferred upon the incumbent AFGE--by excluding the rival NTEU from the agency's premises--did not constitute assistance, sponsorship, or control within the meaning of those terms in &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]here is no evidence that through this denial of access SSA interfered with its employees' freedom of choice or failed to maintain the proper arms-length relationship with AFGE....&#8197;[T]here is no evidence that AFGE is...controlled by SSA....&#8197;Nor is there evidence that the denial was viewed by the employees as indicative of the agency favoring AFGE. 52 FLRA 1159, at [1181].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this context "evidence" includes not only empirical data but also the Authority's expert judgment on the question whether the employer's conduct tends to interfere with the employees' freedom of choice <span class="Italic">Cf. NLRB v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.</span>, 494 U.S. 775, 792-93, 110 S. Ct. 1542, 1552-53, 108 L. Ed.2d 801 (1990) (finding it not irrational for NLRB to refuse to apply presumption that replacement workers do not support striking union, in light of Board's assumptions drawn from its expertise); <span class="Italic">General Electric Company v. NLRB</span>, 117 F.3d 627, 636 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (enforcing Board decision that distribution of postelection benefits while objections to election were still unresolved was impermissible attempt to interfere with employees' freedom of choice about unionization). We therefore affirm the Authority's interpretation of the record upon the ground that the Authority, in the exercise of its expert judgment, found no reason to believe that the employer failed to maintain the appropriate arms-length relationship with the AFGE. Consequently, we need not determine whether, as the FLRA seems to have believed, the AFGE was entitled to the advantage of exclusive access to the sidewalks as a benefit of incumbency.</p>
<p class="noindent">After the 1998 D.C. Circuit case, FLRA capitulated and accepted the private sector authority of <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Babcock and Wilcox Co.</span>, 351 U.S. 105 (1956), in lieu of an inflexible "equivalent status" rule, in <span class="Italic">SSA and NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 964, 966-67 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On judicial review for a second time, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the Authority's revised framework for evaluating alleged violations of section 7116(a)(3) and affirmed the Authority's determination that there had been no (a)(3) violation in this case. 139 F.3d at 220.

The court pointed out that SSA administers a permit process pursuant to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR) and these regulations require that every application for a permit be granted unless the proposed use falls into one of five specific categories. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because SSA does not have a general no-solicitation policy, the court concluded that this exception does not apply. Additionally, the court noted that even if SSA had a no-solicitation policy, the court "would have to fault the Authority for applying the isolated beneficent acts exception without examining the 'quantum...of incidents' in which the SSA granted permits to beneficent organizations" prior to concluding that the prior beneficent acts were isolated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 218-19. As a result, the court remanded this aspect of the case to the Authority<span class="Italic">. Id. </span>at 219.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the court rejected the Authority's concern with retroactive application of the new rule. Pointing out that SSA faced no liability for backpay or other material relief, the court noted that a finding of a violation would not unfairly impose on SSA. Accordingly, the court concluded that if, on remand, the Authority adheres to the standard in <span class="Italic">Babcock and Wilcox </span>and thus finds that SSA engaged in a ULP, "then the Authority may not deny the NTEU a remedy on the ground that it must avoid retroactive lawmaking<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 220.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purpose of resolving the complaint in this case, we view <span class="Italic">Babcock and Wilcox </span>as an appropriate starting point for evaluating whether SSA violated section 7116(a)(1). Applying the court's determination that <span class="Italic">Hammary </span>is not applicable here because SSA did not have a no-solicitation policy, we conclude that SSA impermissibly discriminated against NTEU in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute when SSA denied NTEU access to distribute information on its outside, public premises after having granted similar access to others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted earlier herein, the Authority held that it would be inequitable to apply retroactively a revised rule to SSA. This is particularly true given SSA's acknowledged and detrimental reliance on heretofore established Authority law as its basis for denying NTEU a permit. <span class="Italic">SSA I, </span>45 FLRA at 311. Notwithstanding the Authority's reluctance to retroactively apply the revised rule to SSA in this case, the court has clearly ruled that the Authority may not refuse to sanction SSA on this basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the court's ruling, we adopt, as law of the case, the court's determination that the Authority is obliged to find that SSA violated the Statute in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_162"></span>...Interpreting <span class="Italic">Babcock</span>, the Authority has stated that an agency commits a ULP in violation of &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute where the agency bars (non&#8209;employee) union organizers access to agency property and either: (1) the agency has a discriminatory access policy; or (2) there are no other reasonable means for the union to communicate its message to employees.[17] Here, the GC only alleged that the Agency had a discriminatory access policy, so we consider only that aspect of <span class="Italic">Babcock</span> here.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 52 FLRA 1159, 1187 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to prove a discriminatory policy under <span class="Italic">Babcock</span>, the GC has the burden[18] to demonstrate that the Agency treated like situations differently.[19] As it stands now, the record does not permit us to make that assessment. In this regard, there are no stipulations of fact, and the most fundamental, material questions remain unanswered.</p>
