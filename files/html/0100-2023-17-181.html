<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-179"><span class="space">k.</span> Constitutional Law</h5>
<p class="noindent">FLRA entertains exceptions based on constitutional arguments, <span class="Italic">DHHS, Gallup Indian Med. Ctr. and LIUNA Local 1376</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-045.html">60 FLRA 202</a>, 207 n.7 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the parties do not assert here, and did not assert before the Arbitrator, that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over the constitutional claims at issue. In addition, the Authority consistently has resolved exceptions to arbitration awards involving constitutional claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R4-75</span>, 57 FLRA 568 (2001) (constitutional right to due process); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 4042</span>, 51 FLRA 1709 (1996) (Member Armendariz writing separately on other grounds) (First Amendment rights). Consistent with this unchallenged precedent, we resolve the Agency's exceptions regarding the First and Fifth Amendments. We note, in this connection, that no precedent indicates that we are precluded from resolving constitutional issues.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA allowed exceptions to an arbitration award that set aside a suspension based on a First Amendment defense. FLRA decided in <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Div. ILA, Panama Canal Pilots Branch</span>, 33 FLRA 15, 21-22 (1988), that the arbitrator had not properly applied the balancing tests in <span class="Italic">Rankin v. McPherson</span>, 107 S. Ct. 2891 (1987). The case involved a Panamanian national who conducted a short work slowdown or stoppage to demonstrate his political beliefs concerning civil unrest in Panama. FLRA's analysis of the constitutional issues was lengthy. That discussion will not be repeated here because it relates to the specific facts of the case. Of importance was FLRA's view of the significance of constitutional issues in federal sector arbitration cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Statute requires that Federal agencies exercise their management rights "in accordance with applicable laws." <span class="Italic">See</span> section 7106(a)(2). Of course, applicable laws include the U.S. Constitution. <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison</span>, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176-77 (1803) (finding that the Constitution is a paramount law). Furthermore, we note that one of the grounds for finding an arbitrator's award deficient under section 7122(a) is that the award conflicts with law. Thus, in determining whether an arbitrator's award violates law, we have considered whether awards are contrary to the U.S. Constitution....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Commission must operate within the confines of the U.S. Constitution in disciplining a Commission employee for speech and a work stoppage during the performance of his duties as a Panama Canal pilot. Therefore, we find that the Arbitrator appropriately found that the Commission was limited by the guarantees of the First Amendment in disciplining the grievant for his speech....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reaffirmed the obligation of an arbitrator to consider constitutional issues, concluding, in a free speech case, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 37 FLRA 766, 770 (1990), that the grievant's speech was only of private concern, not warranting constitutional protection:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The constitutional claim that the Agency's prior approval rule violates the employee's First Amendment right of free speech is raised for the first time in the Union's exceptions. This claim is properly before the Authority under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute which requires the Authority to review arbitrators' awards to ascertain whether they are contrary to any law, rule or regulation. Of course, any law includes the U.S. Constitution. <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison</span>, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176-77 (1803) (finding that the Constitution is a paramount law)....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reviewed decisions of the Supreme Court concerning First Amendment rights pertaining to commercial speech in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 61 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Albany Dist.</span>, 39 FLRA 476, 481-94 (1991), involving the agency's attempt (disallowed by the arbitrator) to restrict the grievant's advertising of a private law practice that was allowed by the agency. Another discussion of constitutional law occurred in the context of a challenge to an award sustaining a short-term suspension and the constitutional due process required in a disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1151 and VA</span>, 54 FLRA 20, 26-27 (1998) (summarizing <span class="Italic">Lodge 1998</span>); <span class="Italic">VA, Nat'l Memorial Cemetery of Pac. and IAM Hawaii Fed. Lodge 1998</span>, 45 FLRA 1164, 1174-79 (1992) (discussed below as to awards concerning suspensions).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to an award sustaining discipline imposed because of an employee's remarks to another individual, FLRA dismissed a First Amendment challenge, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3197 and VAMC, Seattle</span>, 48 FLRA 350, 354-55 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator failed to find that the Agency's discipline of the grievant violated the grievant's First Amendment right of free speech. This claim is properly before the Authority under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute, which <span id="page_1980"></span>requires the Authority to review arbitrators' awards to ascertain whether they are contrary to any law, rule, or regulation, including the U.S. Constitution....&#8197;In determining whether an employee's First Amendment rights have been violated, we apply the test set out in <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Connick</span>). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission</span>, 33 FLRA at 22, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Rankin v. McPherson</span>, 107 S. Ct. 2891 (1987). The threshold question under the test in <span class="Italic">Connick</span> is whether the grievant's speech involves a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 146. Only if it is determined that the speech involves a matter of public concern, and thus it is constitutionally protected, does <span class="Italic">Connick</span> require the application of a balancing test. Under the <span class="Italic">Connick</span> balancing test, the employee's right to protected speech and the employer's right to pursue legitimate management objectives are weighed "to seek a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 142, quoting <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education</span>, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union has not, as a threshold matter, shown, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that the statements which formed the basis of the disciplinary action against the grievant are statements involving matters of public concern. In this regard, we note that nothing in the record supports the Union's contention that the remarks for which the grievant was disciplined were made in protest of the Agency's decision to select other individuals instead of the grievant to fill a higher-graded position. Rather, the record shows only that the statements clearly expressed the grievant's personal feelings of animosity toward his supervisor. Consequently, because the grievant's remarks did not pertain to matters of public concern, it is not necessary to apply the <span class="Italic">Connick</span> balancing test. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 37 FLRA at 771 (where speech in question involved purely personal concerns, the Authority did not apply the <span class="Italic">Connick</span> balancing test). Accordingly, we conclude that the Union has not shown that the award is deficient on this basis.</p>

The threshold question under <span class="Italic">Connick</span> is whether the grievant's speech involves a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">Connick,</span> 461 U.S. at 146. Only if the speech involves a matter of public concern and, thus, is constitutionally protected, does <span class="Italic">Connick</span> require the application of a balancing test. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3197 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Seattle, Washington</span>, 48 FLRA 350, 354-55 (1993).

<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not identified the grievant's statements it considers protected by the Constitution and has not established that such statements pertain to matters of public concern. As such, we have no basis on which to conclude that the grievant's statements are protected under the First Amendment and it is not necessary to apply the <span class="Italic">Connick</span> test. Accordingly, we conclude that the Union has not established that the award is deficient as contrary to the Constitution.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, Gallup Indian Med. Ctr. and LIUNA Local 1376</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-045.html">60 FLRA 202</a>, 207-09 (2004), determined that an arbitrator correctly concluded that a First Amendment violation occurred when an agency blocked an economically advantageous transfer to an employee who was critical of health care offered at his facility:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The finding of a First Amendment violation is not deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing claims alleging that a government employer violated the First Amendment by retaliating against an employee based on the employee's protected speech, courts first consider whether the speech can be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Gardetto</span>, 100 F.3d at 811. If it can, then courts balance the employee's interest, as a citizen, in commenting on matters of public concern against the interest of the government, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public service it performs through its employees. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing<span class="Italic"> Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.</span>, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968)). If the balance tips in favor of the employee, then the employee must prove that the protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the detrimental employment decision. <span class="Italic">See Gardetto</span>, 100 F.3d at 811. If the employee makes that showing, then the burden shifts to the government to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision in the absence of the protected speech. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Matters of public concern</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether speech involves matters of public concern, courts consider the content, form and context of the speech. <span class="Italic">See Ulrich v. City &#x0026; County of S.F.</span>, 308 F.3d 968, 978 (9th Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">Ulrich</span>). With regard to content, speech regarding a government-run hospital's ability to care adequately for patients may involve a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 978-79. Whether it does so depends on the form and context of the speech. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 979.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering the form and context of speech, courts consider such factors as the employee's motivation and the audience chosen for the speech. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 979. In this connection, courts consider whether the employee spoke in order to bring wrongdoing to light, rather than to further some purely private concern. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 978. While speech addressing patient care involves a matter of public concern where the speech is intended to bring to light deficiencies regarding that care, such speech does not involve a matter of public concern where it is made solely in the context of the speaker's attempt to protect his or her job. <span class="Italic">Compare Rodgers v. Banks</span>, 344 F.3d 587, 600-01 (6th Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">Rodgers</span>) (found to address matter of public concern), and <span class="Italic">Scheiner v. N.Y. City Health &#x0026; Hosps.</span>, 152 F. Supp.2d 487, 495-96 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (same); <span class="Italic">with Zaky v. United States Veterans Admin.</span>, 793 F.3d 832, 839 (7th Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">Zaky</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 937 (found not to address matter of public concern). In addition, the fact that the speech is made internally rather than to the public or the press does not demonstrate that it is not a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Givhan v. W. Line Consol. Sch. Dist.</span>, 439 U.S. 410, 415-16 (1979) (<span class="Italic">Givhan</span>); <span class="Italic">Price v. Brittain</span>, 874 F.2d 252, 258 (5th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Price</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant's speech concerned matters that related to patient safety, specifically, nurses working double shifts and staffing only one nurse in the ICU. Thus, the content of the statements supports a conclusion that they involve matters of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Rodgers</span>, 344 F.3d at 600-01.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the form and context of the statements, the Arbitrator found that the grievant raised the statements concerning ICU "because [he] felt it was a dangerous situation." The Agency provides no basis for finding that the grievant made the statements in order to further some purely private concern, rather than to bring wrongdoing to light. In this connection, while the Agency asserts that the grievant met with the CEO in order to resolve a leave issue, this assertion concerns the reason for the meeting, not whether the statements at issue--which did not concern leave--were intended to further a purely private concern of the grievant. In fact, the Arbitrator found that the grievant made the statements only <span class="Italic">after</span> the CEO indicated that he would "look into" the leave matter, which supports a conclusion that the grievant was not making the statements in order to convince the CEO to look into the leave matter. Because the Agency provides no basis for finding that the grievant's motivation in making the statements was to further a purely private concern, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Zaky</span>, 793 F.2d 832, where the employee's statements were made in the context of the grievant defending against complaints lodged against him. Finally, the fact that the grievant made the disclosure internally, rather than to the press or the public at large, provides no basis for finding that the speech did not involve a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Givhan</span>, 439 U.S. at 415-16; <span class="Italic">Price</span>, 874 F.2d at 258.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the speech involved matters of public concern.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Balancing the interests</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second step of the First Amendment analysis is to balance the employee's interest, as a citizen, in commenting on matters of public concern against the interest of the government, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public service it performs through its employees. <span class="Italic">See Gardetto</span>, 100 F.3d at 811. Under this analysis, the employer cannot rely on purely speculative allegations that the speech caused or will cause disruption to the employer's effective operations. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 815-16. Instead, the employer must demonstrate real, not imagined, disruption. <span class="Italic">See McKinley v. City of Eloy</span>, 705 F.2d 1110, 1115 (9th Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">McKinley</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that "it is evident there is no legitimate Agency interest involved, so no 'balance' is possible." The Agency does not argue that this finding is deficient or provide any basis for concluding that the grievant's speech caused or will cause disruption to the Agency's effective operations. Accordingly, the Agency has not demonstrated that its interests outweigh the grievant's interests here.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;Substantial or motivating factor</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the third step of the First Amendment analysis, the employee must prove that the protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the detrimental employment decision. <span class="Italic">See Gardetto</span>, 100 F.3d at 811. It is not necessary for the employee to demonstrate that the employer's decision was based solely on the protected speech; it is sufficient if it is a substantial factor in that decision. <span class="Italic">See McKinley</span>, 705 F.2d at 1115. The question of the employer's motivation is a factual question. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ulrich</span>, 308 F.3d at 979; <span class="Italic">Gardetto</span>, 100 F.3d at 811.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1981"></span>The Arbitrator found that the grievant's protected speech was "the motivating factor for the call to Whiteriver." Because this is a factual question, the Authority defers to the Arbitrator's finding on this matter. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. Accordingly, we conclude that the grievant's protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in the phone call. The Agency does not argue, and we find no basis for concluding, that the phone call does not constitute a "detrimental employment decision" under the First Amendment analysis--particularly given that the phone call resulted in the revocation of the transfer offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">d.&#x2003;Same decision absent the protected speech</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the fourth step of the First Amendment analysis, the employer has the opportunity to demonstrate that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected speech. <span class="Italic">See Gardetto</span>, 100 F.3d at 811. This inquiry also involves a factual determination. <span class="Italic">See Rodgers</span>, 344 F.3d at 602-03; <span class="Italic">Gardetto</span>, 100 F.3d at 811.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not allege that the officials would have made the phone call in the absence of the protected disclosures.&#x2003;Accordingly, the Agency has not demonstrated that it would have made the phone call in the absence of the protected speech.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Arbitrator's finding<span class="Italic"> </span>of a First Amendment violation is not contrary to law, and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1151 and VA</span>, 54 FLRA 20, 27-28 (1998), did not credit an argument that the grievant was denied equal protection of the law when the grievant's discipline was sustained by an arbitrator but an arguably similarly situated coworker was absolved of wrongdoing by the MSPB:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union notes that the grievant's co-worker, who actually adjudicated the benefits claim, was absolved of any wrongdoing on his appeal to the MSPB. As a result, the Union argues that anything less than a full set-aside of the grievant's suspension in this case would violate his right to equal protection. We construe this argument as asserting that the award denies the grievant's rights under the equal protection component to the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority has not previously addressed such an argument in similar circumstances, it is appropriate to consider, in the first instance, the courts' equal protection jurisprudence. Although the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause does not apply to the Federal Government or its agencies, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">District of Columbia v. Carter</span>, 409 U.S. 418, 423-24 (1973), the Supreme Court has held that Federal actions may be tested under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by the same rules that are employed to test the validity of a state's actions under the Fourteenth Amendment. <span class="Italic">Buckley </span>v. <span class="Italic">Valeo</span>, 424 U.S. 1, 93 (1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause does not assure uniformity of judicial decisions. <span class="Italic">Beck v. Washington</span>, 369 U.S. 541, 554-55 (1962). Thus, there is no reason for the Authority to find that the Fourteenth Amendment, or, by extension, the Fifth Amendment, requires consistency between the MSPB's decision and the award of the arbitrator in the present case. Additionally, as discussed above, the arbitrator was not bound by MSPB precedent, as this case involved a non-adverse action. The Union cites no authority for this exception, and there is no other basis upon which to conclude that the award here denied the grievant's right to equal protection of the law....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, Gallup Indian Med. Ctr. and LIUNA Local 1376</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-045.html">60 FLRA 202</a>, 209-210 (2004), determined that the arbitrator did not properly assess a violation of a constitutional liberty interest against an agency that arguably disparaged the grievant in its dealings with another organization that considered employing the grievant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the merits of the exception, in order to establish a liberty interest that is protected by the due process clause, an individual must show "both a tangible loss and a 'charge [made by the government] against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community.'"<span class="Italic"> Roth v. Veterans Admin. of</span> <span class="Italic">the Gov't of United States</span>, 856 F.2d 1401, 1410 (9th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Roth</span>) (citation omitted). Mere defamation or stigma is not sufficient. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Resolution Trust Corp.</span>, 56 F.3d 1497, 1506 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Instead, the individual must demonstrate that the charge made by the government "might result in 'permanent exclusion from, or protracted interruption of, gainful employment within [his or her] trade or profession."<span class="Italic"> Roth</span>, 856 F.2d at 1411 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The phone call was made to officials at only one facility, Whiteriver. There is no claim that the allegations made during that call were also made to other facilities either inside or outside the Agency. In these circumstances, there is no basis for concluding that the phone call both resulted in "a tangible loss" and involved a charge against the grievant "that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community" and "result in 'permanent exclusion from, or protracted interruption of, gainful employment within [his] trade or profession.'" <span class="Italic">Roth</span>, 856 F.2d at 1410, 1411 (citations omitted). Thus, we conclude that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Agency violated the grievant's Fifth Amendment liberty interest.</p>
