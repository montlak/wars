<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects proper conduct from an ALJ. A 14-day suspension sought by the agency was sustained against an ALJ who kicked a personnel specialist in the buttocks. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce v. Dolan</span>, 39 MSPR 314, 318 (1988) (citing <span class="Italic">In re Glover</span>, 1 MSPR 660 (1980)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Matter of Glover</span>, 1 MSPR 660, 663 (1980) ("[R]equiring courtesy and consideration in work relations between government employees is consistent with the goals of the regulations to promote the proper performance of government business and to maintain citizen confidence in their government"; further, conduct violating generally accepted rules of conduct "constitutes 'good cause' for suspension"). <span class="Italic">SSA v. Davis</span>, 19 MSPR 279, 282 (1984), determined that good cause existed for removal of an ALJ who made offensive comments to female employees, with a consequential erosion in confidence in the administrative process. The respondent's rehabilitative efforts did not outweigh the severity of the offense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Boini</span>, CB-7521-13-0192-T-1 (NP 2/22/2016) (removal of ALJ for "nonconsensual physical contact with a female security guard stationed at a hearing office" and being under the influence of alcohol at a hearing office); <span class="Italic">SSA v. Carr</span>, 78 MSPR 313, 338, 343 (1998) (removal of an ALJ was authorized for multiple inappropriate and vulgar comments in an office setting). An ALJ was ordered suspended for 70 days for sexual harassment through unwelcome touchings of female hearing assistants. <span class="Italic">SSA v. Carter</span>, 35 MSPR 485, 495 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Manion</span>, 19 MSPR 298, 303 (1984), sustained the 30-day suspension sought by SSA for insubordination: an agency has the authority under the good cause standard to discipline an ALJ for unreasonable refusal to carry out the primary function of hearing and deciding cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Burris</span>, 39 MSPR 51, 57 (1988) (removal was justified for abuse of grievance process and for "consistent attempts to undermine his supervisor's authority by countermanding his instructions, by ridiculing him, directly and in conversations with other employees, and by unreasonably refusing to deal with him," with detrimental effects on the scheduling of hearings; there was also refusal to abide by an order directing the appellant to cease using intemperate language, and the misuse of official mail privileges); <span class="Italic">SSA v. Boham</span>, 38 MSPR 540, 543 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3057) (suspension for refusing to hear certain cases requiring travel); <span class="Italic">SSA v. Arterberry</span>, 15 MSPR 320, 326 (1983) (suspension for refusing to take distant cases). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-129.html#sec8-128">Insubordination and Similar Misconduct</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Akin to insubordination and providing cause for removal were charges that an ALJ sought to embarrass a supervisory judge and, in the process, disrupted office operations, <span class="Italic">SSA v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner specified that Judge Anglada received at his official duty station a letter from SDI Publications notifying him that it had received his order form indicating that he was interested in obtaining its product, "How To Get The Women You Desire Into Bed," but had not received his payment. The specification further provided that the SDI Publications letter also contained the order form that Judge Anglada purportedly used to order this publication, but the form contained the respondent's preprinted name and address, which had been obliterated with blue ink and upon which Judge Anglada's name and work address had been handwritten. The petitioner alleged that this handwriting was not Judge Anglada's nor was it written with his consent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner further specified that Judge Anglada similarly received at his duty station a notice addressed to Jose P. Anglada, from the Promotion Fulfillment Corporation regarding a free sample of Fixodent Fresh denture adhesive cream, and four order forms that were returned by the Postal Service for postage due. These four order forms included a request from J. Fidel Anglada for 25 items from "Info express," mailed to Modern Maturity, a request from Josie Anglada for 14 items from the Oregon Tourism Division, a request from Jose Pepino Anglada for 31 items from the Smithsonian Magazine, and a request from Mary Anglada for a catalog and samples from the American Wedding Album. The petitioner specified that these requests were not in Judge Anglada's handwriting, that they did not correctly identify his name, that he did not know anyone with those names, and that these purported names and address were written without his knowledge or consent. Finally, the petitioner alleged that these requests were written in the respondent's handwriting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's second charge alleged that the respondent's forgeries described in its first charge caused Judge Anglada to receive more than 1,547 pieces of mail at his duty station since August 1994, that this mail volume diverted staff attention from official duties and created an additional workload for staff performing the mail collection and distribution functions, that Judge Anglada and his staff spent extra official time identifying and sorting the unwanted mail, thereby decreasing their production and disrupting the agency's mission, and that the respondent's actions in causing this unproductive diversion adversely reflected on his integrity, credibility, and judicial fitness, and was incompatible with the high trust and confidence required of his official position. The petitioner then supported this charge with seven specifications describing the adverse impact the solicited mail had on <span id="Page_2257"></span>the agency's mail distribution process during a specified time period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's final charge alleged that the facts supporting the first two charges established that the respondent failed to comport with generally accepted rules of courtesy and respect in work relations, that his "childish" and disrespectful conduct toward Judge Anglada appeared to have been for the sole purposes of harassing and embarrassing Judge Anglada, maligning and impugning Judge Anglada's character and integrity, and undermining his authority. The petitioner further alleged that the respondent's conduct damaged his supervisory relationship with Judge Anglada, compromising the efficient accomplishment of the agency's mission. The petitioner supported this charge with seven specifications, that described the respondent's relationship to the DCALJ [Deputy Chief ALJ], and the agency's regulations governing employee courtesy towards co-workers, and enumerated the many partially fictitious names that the respondent used to identify Judge Anglada, and the types of items the appellant requested for Judge Anglada in his attempt to embarrass him. The petitioner also specified that these actions reflected a significant lack of respect for Judge Anglada's position and authority, an attitude of prejudice towards Hispanic people, and a violation of the duty to show courtesy, consideration and respect to fellow employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to these charges, the respondent denied that he committed the alleged misconduct, and also asserted that the petitioner had constructively removed him by interfering with his decisional independence. The CALJ docketed the constructive removal claim as a second appeal and joined the cases for adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing the CALJ recommended that the Board find that good cause exists for removing the respondent and that it authorize that action. In reaching this conclusion, he found as follows: (1) The petitioner was entitled to the hearing it sought for its proposed action to remove the respondent, despite the respondent's objection; (2) the petitioner proved, under its first charge, that the respondent wrote Judge Anglada's name, title, and address, or variations of them, on the specified six order forms, and that he did so without Judge Anglada's knowledge or consent; (3) the petitioner did not prove its allegation under charge one that Judge Anglada did not know anyone named Josie or Mary Anglada, or that the forms were received during the specified time period; (4) the petitioner proved its second charge, that the respondent was responsible for Judge Anglada's receiving more than 1,547 pieces of unofficial mail, except for its specification regarding when the mail was received; (5) the petitioner proved all of the specifications contained in charge three; (6) the petitioner established good cause for the severe penalty of removal; and (7) the respondent did not establish any of his affirmative defenses....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to adhere to time and attendance requirements and unapproved outside practice of law in violation of agency rules of conduct furnished the cause necessary for the Board to sustain removal of an ALJ in <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 MSPR 684, 695-96, 699 (1993). "Although the agency concedes the appellant's work product was satisfactory and timely, his misconduct has been repeated, and there is no reason to anticipate his rehabilitation." <span class="Italic">Whittlesey</span> said of the charge concerning the outside practice of law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In answer to the charges that he violated agency rules by engaging in the practice of law, respondent asserts that the agency's prohibition violates his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. Whittlesey does not claim that there is a First Amendment right to practice law in violation of applicable rules, but he contends that, because speech is involved in the practice of law, under <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) v. United States</span>, 990 F.2d 1271 (D.C. Cir. [1993])...the government may not constitutionally prohibit him from practicing law and representing clients in matters unrelated to his work or function. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> the court found that section 501(b) of the Ethics in Government Act, banning federal employees from receiving honoraria for off-duty appearances, speeches or articles, violated the First Amendment as it applied to executive branch employees. The court held that the statutory prohibition was unconstitutionally overbroad because it was not limited to employees' receipt of payments where there was some nexus between the employee's job and either the subject matter of the expression or the character of the payor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1275.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> decision does not support respondent's argument because there is a nexus between the practice of law and the position of a judicial officer like the respondent. This connection is recognized by the American Bar Association (ABA) Code of Judicial Conduct which provides in Section 4G that, except when he or she is acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span> or advising family members without compensation, "[a] judge shall not practice law." The Board has previously found that the ABA Code is an appropriate guide for evaluating the conduct of administrative law judges. <span class="Italic">Matter of Chocallo</span>, 1 MSPR 612, 652-53 (1978). The SSA Guide on Employee Conduct parallels this prohibition in Part VII, Section I, "Restrictions Applying to Administrative Law Judges." As the Guide explains, an appearance of impropriety and, in many cases, of conflict of interest is created when an individual acts as an advocate in disputes between parties who may later appear before the individual acting as an ALJ. We also agree with the agency that the prohibition is appropriate as a method of preventing collateral misuse of position and distraction from official duties. Respondent has shown no violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The ALJ position is "a position of prominence, whose incumbents usually engender great respect." <span class="Italic">Steverson</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 649, &#x00B6; 20. Therefore, the Board has held that ALJs are required to conduct themselves in a fitting manner. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Manion</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 298, 302 (1984). This means, at a minimum, they must not violate generally accepted rules of conduct. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Carter</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 485, 491 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 856 F.2d 202 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Davis</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 279, 282, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 758 F.2d 661 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Table). Behavior in contravention of this standard undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 282; <span class="Italic">see also McEachern v. Macy</span>, 233 F. Supp. 516, 521-22 (W.D.S.C. 1964) (finding good cause for removal of a Social Security Administration hearings examiner for failure to pay debts, which brought discredit on the agency), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 341 F.2d 895 (4th Cir. 1965).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has held that the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Conduct is an appropriate guide for evaluating the conduct of ALJs. <span class="Italic">Whittlesey</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 696; <span class="Italic">Matter of Chocallo</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 612, 65253 (1978). The ABA Model Code (February 2007) provides in pertinent part at Canon 1, Rule 1.2:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AHE 12 at 10.[8] Comment[1] to Canon 1 explains that, "Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by improper conduct," and that the principle "applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a judge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;"Actual improprieties include violations of law, court rules or provisions of this Code. The test for appearance of impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge violated this Code or engaged in other conduct that reflects adversely on the judge's honesty, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge." AHE at 10, Comment[5].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner has proven that the respondent's actions were conduct unbecoming an ALJ, i.e., conduct which was improper, unsuitable or detracting from one's character or reputation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Crouse v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 57, 63 (1997), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds and remanded sub nom. Lachance, supra; Miles v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1992). Further, the respondent's physical altercation with his domestic partner, resulting in the involvement of neighbors and the intervention of police officers, clearly violated generally accepted rules of conduct. His conduct was inconsistent with maintaining respect for the administrative adjudicatory process. Accordingly, we find that the petitioner has shown good cause for disciplinary action against the respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent's argument in his cross-PFR that the petitioner was required to prove the elements of a criminal charge under Florida law is incorrect. When an agency charges an employee with a crime, it must establish the elements of that offense. <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663, 666 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (charge of theft); <span class="Italic">Fouquet v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6;&#x00B6;I 24-26 (1999) (charges of counterfeiting government checks and participating in various theft crimes). The petitioner, however, charged the respondent with conduct unbecoming an ALJ, not with the commission of the crime of domestic violence battery or other criminal offense. Therefore, it was not required to prove the elements of a crime. <span class="Italic">See Mahan v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 140, &#x00B6; 6 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2258"></span>In his cross-PFR, the respondent argues also that there was not a sufficient nexus between the charged conduct and his position as an ALJ to support a finding of good cause. The <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief by the AALJ also argues that nexus is not established. We find that these arguments, as well as the nexus discussion in the ID, reflect a misunderstanding of the applicable standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The analysis of the nexus requirement is required in cases under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, where an agency must show as part of its burden of proof that an adverse action promotes the efficiency of the service. This requires that the agency prove three distinct elements, i.e., that the charged conduct occurred, that there is a nexus to the efficiency of the service, and that the particular penalty imposed is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Pope v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 F.3d 1144, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a)); <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Department of Commerce</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 8 (2008). Actions against ALJs, however, are authorized under a different statute and require a showing of good cause. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.139-.140. As discussed above, the Board has clearly stated that the good cause standard is not equivalent to the efficiency of the service standard. <span class="Italic">Mills</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 467-68 (citing <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 330, n.8); <span class="Italic">see also Manion</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 303 (modifying an All's finding that disciplinary action was warranted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 because he held that there was a nexus to the efficiency of the service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether good cause exists for disciplinary action against an ALJ, the Board has not undertaken a separate analysis of nexus. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steverson</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 649 (removal for lack of candor); <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 313 (removal for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, reckless disregard for another's personal safety), <span class="Italic">Whittlesey</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 684 (removal for violation of agency rules and a settlement agreement regarding the unauthorized practice of law and for time and attendance violations); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Burris</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 51 (1988) (removal, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, for insubordinate and disruptive behavior), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 878 F.2d 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also McEachern</span>, 233 F. Supp. 516 (removal for failure to pay personal debts). In accord with Board precedent, we do not engage in an analysis of nexus <span class="Italic">per se</span> in this case. The good cause standard for disciplinary action has been met by the showing, set forth above, that the respondent engaged in conduct unbecoming an ALJ, which violated generally accepted rules of conduct and was inconsistent with maintaining public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Penalty</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In original jurisdiction cases under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, it is the Board, rather than the employing agency, which selects the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">Steverson</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 649, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">Burris</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. at 64. The Board does not give deference to the agency's selection of a penalty, as it does in chapter 75 cases. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Anyel</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 261, 274 n.23 (1993). The Board uses the factors articulated in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06, however, to guide its penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 282 n.5 (stating that, although <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> deals with penalty selection in traditional adverse action cases, the considerations it details are equally appropriate to penalty determinations under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board considers first and foremost among the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors the seriousness of the misconduct and its relationship to the employee's position and duties. <span class="Italic">Steverson</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 649, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">Rackers v. Department of Justice</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 262, 282 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 194 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). In this case, the respondent's actions caused his managers to doubt his ability to serve adequately as a judge. Chief ALJ (CALJ) Frank Cristaudo and Regional CALJ (RCALJ) 0llie Garmon testified that the respondent's conduct demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament. We agree. "The appellant's misconduct was serious and raises serious concerns about his lack of judgment and impulse control and his ability to perform the duties of his position." <span class="Italic">Carlton v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 633, &#x00B6; 8 (upholding the removal of a Deputy U.S. Marshal for conduct unbecoming when he threw a vase at his wife, choked her and pointed a gun at her), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 115 Fed. Appx. 430 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CALJ Cristaudo and RCALJ Garmon also stated that they believed some female claimants and representatives would question whether the respondent would give them a fair hearing or would treat women differently. CALJ Cristaudo also testified that some disability benefits claims involved a history of domestic violence, and that claimants could request the respondent's recusal or reassignment or a remand, alleging bias. We find these concerns to be reasonable. An agency need not wait until such adverse effects come to pass but may act based on its legitimate expectation of them. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Schumacher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 575, 579-80 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also to be considered under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> is the respondent's job level and type of employment, contacts with the public, and the prominence of his position. 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. As discussed above, the respondent holds a prominent position as an ALJ. As such, he is expected to behave in a fitting manner, in compliance with the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, which addresses both professional and personal conduct. The Code provides that a judge should act at all times so as to promote public confidence in the judiciary. However, the respondent's conduct violated generally accepted standards of behavior and, as such, would diminish public confidence in the administrative adjudicative process. As CALJ Cristaudo testified, the respondent's actions "violated the public trust" and reflected on other agency ALJs. In such situations, removal is the appropriate penalty. As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 294-95,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]here is no doubt that respondent's actions violated generally accepted rules of conduct and must be proscribed. There is similarly no doubt that his actions could erode public confidence in the judicial functions both of the agency specifically and the federal service generally. Accordingly, it is concluded that such behavior constitutes good cause to remove [him].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also McEachern</span>, 233 F. Supp. at 521-22 (upholding the removal of a SSA hearing examiner for failure to pay debts, because the agency would be held in lower esteem if it continued to employ him); <span class="Italic">cf. Stump v. Department of Transportation,</span> 761 F.2d 680, 681-82 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (upholding the removal of an air traffic controller who engaged in off-duty drug use because it would detract from public confidence in the agency).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the respondent's claim of provocation, since this may weigh in favor of a lesser penalty for an All's misconduct. <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 339. However, we do not find that provocation is a mitigating factor, as did the ALJ who heard this case. Ms. Castro struck the respondent in an attempt to get away from him after he pushed and grabbed her when she woke him up. She did not explain why this was necessary; thus, her action may have been improper. However, this does not lessen the respondent's culpability for his conduct thereafter. As the ALJ stated in the ID, the situation escalated as the respondent followed Ms. Castro throughout the house and eventually out into the neighborhood. Because further conflict could have been avoided, but the respondent instead chose to pursue Ms. Castro and to strike her repeatedly, we do not find that he was provoked. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 613, &#x00B6; 14 (2005) (the appellant was not provoked to strike a customer who was screaming profanity and racial slurs at her where she chose to follow the customer), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 206 Fed. Appx. 990 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, contrary to the ALJ's statement, the respondent has not shown remorse. He testified that he was sorry the incident had occurred but denied any culpability or wrongdoing. This does not suggest that there is a strong potential for rehabilitation as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 13 (2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Neuman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 26 (2008)).[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12] By contrast, the Board has reduced a removal to a 120-day suspension where the appellant, a correctional officer, unintentionally struck military police responding to a domestic incident and where there was evidence that the appellant was experiencing severe underlying emotional distress and had expressed remorse for his action. <span class="Italic">Larry v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 348, 359-62 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered as a mitigating factor the respondent's long federal service without prior discipline. He has had a 35-year career, 28 years as an attorney for the Federal Aviation Administration and 7 years as an ALJ for the SSA. In that time, he has not been subject to any prior disciplinary action. In addition, the record does not reflect that the incident of January 27, 2008, gained great public notoriety.[13] However, we do not find that these factors outweigh the nature and seriousness of the respondent's violent conduct and its adverse impact on his agency, as well as the absence of provocation and his lack of remorse. Nor do we find that a penalty less than removal would be sufficient to deter future conduct by the respondent or others similar to the conduct that took place in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13] Although the record indicates his neighbors and SSA employees were aware of the incident, the matter did not obtain press coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we find that removal is the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Kinslow v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 315 Fed. Appx. 286, 289 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (NP) (upholding the removal of an Internal Revenue Service agent who assaulted his wife with a martial arts weapon); <span class="Italic">Carlton</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 633, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Royster v. Department of Justice</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 495, 501 (1993) (a correctional officer was removed for threatening and abusive calls to women).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal of an ALJ was sustained on charges of conduct unbecoming an ALJ involving misuse of an agency letterhead for personal correspondence in violation of agency policy, misuse of government property involving government computers (viewing sexually graphic files), and use of the equipment for personal business ventures, lack of candor during a supervisor's investigatory interview, and failure to follow agency policy concerning use of the ALJ's business address to send and receive personal correspondence. <span class="Italic">Steverson v.

Appx. 467, 471 (Fed. Cir. <span id="Page_2259"></span>2011 NP).
