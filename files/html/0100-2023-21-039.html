<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-39"><span class="space">a.</span> Adequacy of Position Offered Through Reassignment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the issue of accommodation arises as to a disability annuity, the individual must be disabled for his or her existing job, <span class="Italic">Gribble v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 274, 276 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8451 provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> that an employee who is applying for disability retirement must be considered for reassignment by the employing agency to a vacant position that is at the same grade or pay level, that is in the employee's commuting area, and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(2)(B). It provides further that an employee will not be eligible for disability retirement if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to such a vacant position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reconsideration decision in this appeal does not include a specific finding that the appellant had met the eligibility requirement described above by showing that his employing agency was unable to reassign him. It does, however, include a statement that the employing agency "report[ed] that accommodation [was] not an option...." We therefore do not concur in the administrative judge's finding that OPM made its reconsideration decision without reference to the employing agency's efforts to accommodate the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if the reconsideration decision could be construed as having failed to address the accommodation issue adequately, the record does not indicate that any such failure would warrant remanding the appeal to OPM. The Board has held that, where the employee has failed to demonstrate that he is disabled from essential duties of his current job, neither statute nor regulation requires that the employing agency must consider an employee seeking disability retirement for reassignment to a vacant position. <span class="Italic">See Sorensen v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 MSPR 77, 82 (1989). In this appeal, OPM's disallowance of the appellant's disability retirement application was based on its finding that the appellant had failed to show that he was disabled for useful and <span id="Page_4135"></span>efficient service. Unless the appellant proves that this finding is incorrect, a finding regarding the employing agency's efforts to accommodate him is not necessary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at<span class="Italic"></span> 82<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee whose disability can be accommodated by the agency through reassignment should not be retired on disability when the accommodation would be reasonable. <span class="Italic">Appleman v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 305, 308 (1982) (employee declined reassignment to another position and the evidence did not demonstrate that the employee could not perform usefully and efficiently in that position); s<span class="Italic">ee</span> <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 324, 327 (1991) ("in order to defeat a disability retirement claim, the agency must show it has reasonably accommodated the employee's condition and that it is more likely than not that such accommodation will continue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Bruno v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 11 M.S.P.R. 3, 7-8 (1982) (an employee should not be retired on disability where the disability could reasonably be accommodated by the agency).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is given temporary modified duties, the position that is assessed for purposes of a disability retirement application is the most recent permanent assignment, not the temporary assignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eshelman v. OPM</span>, 72 MSPR 173, 176 (1996) ("The relevant position for determining the appellant's disability is the Equipment Specialist position that he last occupied before filing his application for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Malan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 283, 289 (1992)"; "an informal, temporary modification of an employee's duties does not constitute a valid accommodation effort for purposes of disability retirement"; "appellant's right to disability retirement must be determined solely based on his regular, unmodified duties as an Equipment Specialist").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To bar an employee otherwise qualified to receive a disability annuity, the reassignment is to be at the same grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cheers v.

Thus, the appellant's employing agency's offer to reassign the appellant to the Security Guard position did not constitute an accommodation.

<p class="Body-Text">Retained pay does not equate to the same grade for the position, <span class="Italic">Rader v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 333, 334-35 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Section 8337(a), appellant therefore must be found to be entitled to disability retirement if he is not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade or level. It is undisputed that only one offer of reassignment was made to appellant, the position of Warehouse Worker, WG-6. 10. The issue for resolution then is whether appellant's rejection of the offer of the position of Warehouse Worker, WG-6, with retained pay constituted failure of proof of the statutory requirements of Section 8337(a). For the reasons set forth below, we find that it does not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. Section 8337(a) state that the reassignment must be made to a vacant position at the "same <span class="Italic">grade</span> or <span class="Italic">pay</span> level." 5 C.F.R. Section 831.502(a) (emphasis added). Reassignment is defined as "...a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency from one position to another without promotion or demotion." 5 C.F.R. Section 210.102(b)(12). A demotion is a change to a lower grade when the positions are in the "same type graded wage schedule." 5 C.F.R. Section 210.102(b)(4)(i). Thus, by definition, placement of appellant in the WG-6 position would not have been a "reassignment" but rather a "demotion." Further, although retained pay may initially preserve the same pay level, such pay level would subsequently be reduced pursuant to the provisions of the pay retention statute, 5 U.S.C. Section 5363. Moreover, our interpretation of the statutory and regulatory requirements is confirmed by guidance set forth by OPM in FPM Supp. 831-1, S10-4f, which states that "...[A]n employee may decline an offer of a position at a lower grade or pay level,...without affecting his/her eligibility for disability retirement."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Butler v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 598, 599-600 (1986), also concluded that retained pay does not make legitimate a reassignment that is otherwise a demotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the presiding official found that appellant, an Automotive Worker Helper, WG-5, at Fort Sam Houston, Department of the Army, had established that he was disabled from performing useful and efficient service in his position. The presiding official also found that appellant's rejection of his employing agency's offer of reassignment to the position of Coding Clerk, GS-3, with retained pay, did not render him ineligible for disability retirement because it would have involved a demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition, the agency argues that the presiding official erred in finding appellant eligible for and entitled to disability retirement. First, the agency argues that appellant is ineligible for disability retirement because the offer he declined was a reassignment as defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(12) (1983) inasmuch as it did not involve a demotion as defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4)(i) or (ii) (1983). The agency contends that since appellant would have received retained pay and the two positions were under different wage schedules, the prerequisites for a demotion were not met. Second, the agency argues that appellant failed to demonstrate a relationship between his medical condition and a service deficiency as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b)(1983). These contentions are without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under OPM's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), an employee is entitled to disability retirement if he is unable "to render useful and efficient service because of disease or injury (1) in the employee's current position; or (2) in a vacant position in the same agency at the same grade or pay level for which the individual is qualified for reassignment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a) (1983). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b) (1983). A reassignment is defined as "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency, from one position to another without promotion or demotion." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(12) (1983). A demotion is defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4) (1983) as "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency: (i) to a lower grade when both the old and the new positions are under the General Schedule or under the same type graded wage schedule; or (ii) to a position with a lower rate of pay when both the old and the new positions are under the same type ungraded wage schedule, or are in different pay method categories."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the presiding official noted, the employing agency confirmed that it had no vacant positions at the same grade or pay level and tenure, within the same commuting area, for which appellant met the minimum qualification standards. Thus, its offer to appellant, a WG-5 Automotive Worker Helper, of a GS-3 Coding Clerk position, did not constitute an offer of the same grade or pay level and tenure. We cannot accept the agency's contention that since appellant would have received retained pay the offer involved a valid reassignment and not a demotion as defined at 5 C.F.R. 210.102(b)(4)(ii) (1983). Although appellant may initially have received pay retention to preserve the same pay level, that pay level would subsequently have been reduced pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5363. Consequently, we find that the position offered to appellant would have involved a demotion and affirm the finding of the presiding official that appellant's rejection of the offer did not render him ineligible for disability retirement. We note also that the Federal Personnel Manual states that "[a]n employee may decline an offer of a position at a lower grade or pay level,...,without affecting his/her eligibility for disability retirement." Attachment I to Federal Personnel Manual Letter 831-78, S10-4(f); <span class="Italic">Rader v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 333 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burns v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 688 (1993) (demotion from WG-8 instrument maker to GS-4, even with retained pay, did not qualify as an accommodation that block a disability annuity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reassignment must be to a position of the same tenure as the employee's permanent job. An accommodation would not include conversion to part-time employment, <span class="Italic">Sangenito v. OPM</span>, 82 MSPR 520, 524-25 &#x00B6; 8-10 (1999) <span class="Italic">(recon. den.,</span> <span class="Italic">Sangenito v. OPM</span>, 85 MSPR 211 (2000), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, we find that the record establishes that accommodation in accordance with the terms of the applicable case law and regulations was not possible in this case, so that the appellant is entitled to disability retirement. Specifically, an accommodation is "an adjustment made to an employee's job or work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties of the position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1201 (definition of Accommodation). As noted above, the employing agency must be unable to accommodate the appellant in his former position or in an existing "vacant position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a). The regulations define a "vacant position" and set forth requirements it must meet, including that "[t]he vacant position must be full time, unless the employee's position is less than full time, in which case the vacant position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the current position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed in this case that the accommodations the agency was making to the appellant did not enable him to perform the duties of a letter carrier, although it provided the job to him as a "carrier (modified)" position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1201, providing that for Postal Service employees "a vacant position does not include a position in a different craft." Further, it appears from the record that the appellant had been found partially disabled by, and was receiving benefits from, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) for 4 hours a day. The latter document makes clear that a physician for OWCP found the appellant "capable of working for 4 hours per day, 5 days per week in a sedentary position." The Board is bound by OWCP determinations as to matters over which that agency has statutory authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smith v. U.S. Postal <span id="Page_4136"></span>Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 92 (1999); <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 210, 213 (1985). There is also no dispute that the appellant's letter carrier position was full time employment. As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Paupaw v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 390, 393 (1991), "[a] change from a full-time to a part-time schedule is not considered to be at the same pay level." <span class="Italic">See also Sucic</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 288 (same rule applied as to application under Federal Employees' Retirement System); <span class="Italic">Marczewski v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 343, 348 (1998) ("[i]f the appellant could not work at a full-time position, then he could not be reassigned to one").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not asserted at any point that the appellant's medical conditions could have been accommodated in a full-time position, and there is no evidence to support a finding to that effect. In addition, we find that he meets the other requirements for disability retirement based on his condition and when it arose, and on his length of employment. Accordingly, he is entitled to a disability retirement annuity agency has statutory authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reaffirmed its analysis on a reconsideration request from OPM, <span class="Italic">Sangenito v. OPM</span>, 85 MSPR 211, 215-18 &#x00B6; 10-16 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director's contention that the appellant had been officially reassigned to the part-time position, if correct, and if voluntary and knowing, would suffice as a reason to deny his retirement application because, as we previously noted, there was no evidence that the Postal Service would not have continued that assignment but for the intervening and unrelated circumstances of his removal. On this matter, however, the record contains only a July 9, 1990 letter entitled "Rehabilitation Position," which states that as a result of a medical examination performed for the Department of Labor, he was found capable of working four hours per day, five days per week, in a sedentary position and that he was therefore "being offered the following [four hour daily] modified position within the Rehabilitation Program."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that the appellant performed under this schedule for six years, it is nonetheless also true that nowhere does the record show that his official position of record had thereby become the part-time job. To the contrary, in connection with his removal, both of the letters sent to him by the Postal Service--the notice of Emergency Placement in Off-Duty Status, and the Notice of Removal, are addressed to the appellant as "Full Time Letter Carrier." Further, OPM's file contains a copy of his Individual Retirement Record (IRR) showing that he had been changed to a full-time position as of February 21, 1981, and no statement that he had been changed to a part-time schedule either in July 1990 or at any time thereafter; nor is there any entry there even suggesting it. The IRR is the official document by which OPM is guided in determining an individual's entitlements under the retirement system, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.103 (Standard Form 2806, the IRR, is the "basic record for action on all claims for annuity..."); <span class="Italic">Maxwell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 350, 356 (1998) (same as to applications under the Federal Employees' Retirement System). The Board is without jurisdiction to challenge the employing agency's certification. <span class="Italic">Hollifield v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 MSPR 563, 568-69 (1999). We note that when the Postal Service supplied information and a copy of the appellant's position description to OPM, none of its documentation otherwise showed the appellant occupying a part-time or "Modified" position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that the record supports the conclusion that irrespective of his performance of duty for only four hours a day, the appellant remained officially assigned to a full-time, eight hour a day job. Thus, it is his ability to render useful and efficient service in that position that controls.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board's recent holdings that even unofficial assignments that constitute accommodations preclude an applicant's eligibility for disability retirement do not require a contrary result here to the one previously reached.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Director points out she recently filed a brief, in response to the Board's request for an advisory opinion, on whether light-duty assignments that do not constitute official positions nonetheless constitute "positions" under the regulatory definitions of "disabled," "accommodation," and "vacant position." In addition, the Board published a Federal Register Notice, 63 Fed. Reg. 54,734 (1998), seeking input on the same issue. OPM argued, and the Board ultimately agreed, that "position" should be read broadly so as to preclude the idling on the disability rolls of individuals who could otherwise render useful and efficient service because their employing agencies were able to provide them accommodations that nonetheless did not constitute existing positions. <span class="Italic">See Bracey &#x0026; Wilson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 MSPR 408-11 (1999) (Vice Chair Slavet dissenting). Our agreement in that instance notwithstanding, we disagree that the same preclusion is mandated here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> or <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> suggests that the informal accommodations provided by those appellants' agencies required a reduction in their work hours or pay, or an assignment that was not at "the same grade or level" as those of their official positions of record. Moreover, OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1201, defining accommodation and precluding retirement where the employer can assign the employee to a "vacant position," states that the position "must be full time, unless the employee's position is less than full time, in which case the vacant position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the current position." Because here, as we have found, the record shows that the appellant remained the incumbent of a full-time position, the Postal Service's provision of work four hours a day fails to comport with the regulation and therefore does not constitute the kind of informal accommodation we approved in <span class="Italic">Bracey &#x0026; Wilson</span>. Although the Director states that the appellant was not harmed because OWCP benefits made up for the remaining salary difference, this is not dispositive under the regulation. Moreover, we note that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8106(a), such compensation benefits for a partially disabled employee are "equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his monthly pay and his monthly wage-earning capacity after the beginning of the partial disability." Thus, on the face of it, half of the appellant's salary plus his OWCP benefits would not equate to his full-time earnings, even leaving aside any questions of overtime and differentials to which a full-time schedule might entitle him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that there is a Congressional preference for continuing work rather than being placed on the disability rolls. <span class="Italic">Bracey &#x0026; Wilson</span>, 83 MSPR at 409-11; <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 648, &#x00B6; 24 (1999). Nonetheless, we must also apply the requirement set forth in the law and OPM's own regulations that any assignment that would stop the appellant from his otherwise earned eligibility for disability retirement must provide him work at "the same grade or level," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), and have therefore consistently held that any assignment of a full-time employee must be to a full-time position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Marczewski v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6; 9 (1998) ("[i]f the appellant could not work at a full-time position, then he could not be reassigned to one"); <span class="Italic">Moran v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 138, 144 (1996); <span class="Italic">Paupaw</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 393. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Paupaw</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>., long before <span class="Italic">Bracey &#x0026; Wilson</span>, we stated that an employee who is unable to perform the regular duties of her position should not be granted disability retirement if her agency can reasonably accommodate her with light duty; we nonetheless found that the appellant's placement in a part-time job where her regular duties were full time would not constitute a reasonable accommodation.*</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Burckley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 617, &#x00B6; 2 (1999), the Board noted as a fact that the appellant therein also received OWCP benefits for four hours daily and worked the rest of the day. The case did not otherwise address the effect of that situation, and the Board's decision that he was not entitled to disability retirement centered on his failure to prove a disability rather than this matter. To the extent that anything in <span class="Italic">Burckley</span> can be read as contrary to the decision we reach here, however, we hereby modify it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having fully considered OPM's position in reaching our conclusion in <span class="Italic">Bracey &#x0026; Wilson</span>, but finding here that it is consistent with the equally settled rule that an employee may not be required to accept less than the normal pay and grade of his official position in order to remain capable of rendering the useful and efficient service that precludes disability retirement, we conclude that no further reconsideration of the matter is warranted. Accordingly, we reaffirm our determination that the appellant is entitled to the disability benefit he seeks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering whether the position offered by reassignment was of same tenure to the employee. <span class="Italic">Noyer v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 336, 339 (1990), applied the OPM regulation then in effect:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that she was not required to accept either of the two positions offered by USPS because the evidence shows that they were temporary positions. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b)(7), an offered position must be, among other things, at the same tenure as the position from which the employee seeks disability retirement. "Tenure" is defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(17) as "the period of time an employee may reasonably expect to serve under his current appointment." There is no dispute that the appellant occupied a full-time, permanent position, and the record so indicates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the titles of the two positions offered here--Unassigned Carrier-Level 5, Collections, Temporary Assignment, Light Duty and Unassigned General Clerk: Level 5-Temporary Assignment Light Duty--indicate that both positions were temporary assignments. The USPS confirmed this by informing the appellant that it had no extended light duty available for her other than these two "temporary accommodated [sic] positions." Thus, because the two positions were not permanent assignments, the appellant's refusal to accept either one does not defeat her right to a disability retirement.</p>
