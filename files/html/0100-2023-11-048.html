<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-49"><span class="space">11.</span> Lobbying</h4>
<p class="noindent">As a general proposition, and with particular statutory exceptions, discussed below, unions may negotiate for official time to lobby Congress on employment-related matters, as <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 61 FLRA 209, 216 (2005), explained concerning Proposal 6, "lobbying Congress. Union representatives shall be granted official time to lobby Congress concerning pending or desired legislation affecting conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 does not preclude bargaining over proposals requiring agencies to grant union representatives official time to lobby Congress concerning desired or pending legislation relating to unit members' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., New Hampshire Nat'l Guard</span>, 54 FLRA 301 (1998); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Memphis Dist., Memphis, Tenn.</span>, 52 FLRA 920 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army</span>) (Member Armendariz dissenting in relevant part);<span class="Italic"> Dep't of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 11 FLRA 7 (1983). The Agency provides no support for questioning that precedent. Consequently, contrary to the Agency's argument, Proposal 6 is not inconsistent with 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that funding for the Agency is not derived from Department of Defense appropriations bills and maintains that, therefore, the Agency is not subject to the limitations on lobbying provided in that legislation. <span class="Italic">Cf. New Hampshire Nat'l Guard</span>, 54 FLRA at 308 n.9. The Agency has not demonstrated that those limitations apply to it. Additionally, while the Agency asserts that the proposal is inconsistent with its appropriations statute, the Agency offers no citation or argument to support this assertion. Consequently, there is no basis for finding that Proposal 6 is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that Proposal 6 is within the Agency's duty to bargain.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Member Armendariz does not concur in the result finding this proposal negotiable. Rather, consistent with his opinion in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army</span>, Member Armendariz would request an advisory opinion from the Department of Justice as to whether 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913, a criminal statute enforced by the Department of Justice, precludes an agency from granting employees official time to lobby Members of Congress on matters pertaining to unit employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept.</span> <span class="Italic">of</span> <span class="Italic">Transp.,</span> <span class="Italic">FAA</span> <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 1184 (2010) (discussing 18 USC 1913 and permitted communications between union officials and employees on legislative matters during nonworking times).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Nat'l Right to Work Legal Defense Found., Inc., </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-178.html">71 FLRA 923</a>, 923-26 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), followed guidance from the Justice Department to determine that the official time provisions permitted direct lobbying by union officials, but not grass roots or indirect lobbying through efforts (on official time) designed to have others advance to congress or executives the objectives of the union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation (the Foundation) has requested, under &#x00A7; 2427.2(a) of the Authority's rules and regulations,[1] that the Authority issue a general statement of policy or guidance holding that the Federal Service Labor&#8209;Management Relations Statute (the Statute) does not permit parties to bargain over, or union representatives to use, official time for lobbying activities that are subject to the Anti&#8209;Lobbying Act (the Act).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2427.2(a).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Memphis District, Memphis, Tennessee</span> (<span class="Italic">Army</span>), the Authority considered whether the Act prohibits the granting of official time to union representatives to lobby Congress.[6] The Authority found that &#x00A7; 7102(1) of the Statute, which grants "employees, acting in their representational capacity,...the right <span id="Page_278"></span>to present the views of their labor organization to Congress,"[7] together with &#x00A7; 7131(d), which provides that "any employee in an appropriate unit represented by an exclusive representative, shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest"[8] constituted an express authorization by Congress from the prohibitions in the Act.[9] Thus, the Authority held that the Statute authorizes the use of federal funds, in the nature of official time, to allow union officials to lobby Congress on representational matters.[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In its request, the Foundation argues that Congress did not expressly authorize the use of appropriated funds for lobbying activities through the Statute, and, therefore, the Statute does not permit parties to bargain over, or union representatives to use, official time for lobbying activities that are subject to the Act. In support, the Foundation says that while &#x00A7; 7102(1) allows union representatives to present their labor organization's views to Congress, no section of the Statute <span class="Italic">expressly</span> authorizes the federal government to pay employees engaging in such activity. In this regard, the Foundation asserts that &#x00A7; 7131(d) does not mention lobbying. Moreover, the Foundation contends that its question is most appropriately resolved thorough a statement of policy or guidance because it would be difficult to resolve through other means.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the Foundation's request, the Authority invited interested parties to submit comments with respect to the suggested policy posed by the Foundation.[11] The responses submitted were thoroughly and carefully considered, and the Authority finds that granting the Foundation's request is warranted because "resolution of the question presented would have general applicability under the...Statute."[12]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In view of the Authority's regulations and the interested parties' submissions, we take this opportunity to clarify Authority precedent on the application of the Act to the use of official time for lobbying under &#x00A7; 7102(1) and &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority was faced squarely with the issue that the Foundation now raises in the <span class="Italic">Army</span> case in 1997. In Army, the grievant sought official time to lobby Congress during the union's "Lobby Week" in Washington, D.C. on the following topics: "protection of [f]ederal pay and benefits; [g]overnment downsizing and reorganization; health care reform; civil service reform; protection of temporary employees; and [equal employment opportunity] reform."[13] The Authority cited a 1989 opinion where the Department of Justice opined that the Act "did not prohibit 'public speeches by [e]xecutive [b]ranch employees aimed at generating public support for [a]dminstrative policies and legislative proposals.'"[14] The Authority found that "[t]he same reasoning supports a conclusion that the [Act] does not prohibit the [u]nion's lobbying activities."[15] Accordingly, the Authority found that there were "significant questions" as to whether the union's lobbying activities were within the definition of the items that Congress prohibited in the Act.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13] <span class="Italic">Army</span>, 52 FLRA at 921.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 931 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We note that the Act was amended after the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Army</span>, broadening its coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 107-273, &#x00A7; 205(b), 116 Stat. 1758 (2002). The amendments had no effect on the Authority's rationale in <span class="Italic">Army</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For guidance on the Act, the Authority looks to the agency tasked with its enforcement. The Department of Justice, through its Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), provides legal advice to executive agencies under powers delegated to it by the Attorney General of the United States. In 2005, the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce requested a legal opinion from the OLC on whether federal employees who are union representatives may use official time to engage in grass roots lobbying in which, on behalf of their unions, they ask members of the public to communicate with government officials in support of, or in opposition to, legislative or other measures. In <span class="Italic">Application of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 to AGrass Roots" Lobbying by Union Representatives</span> (the 2005 opinion),[17] the OLC opined that "federal employees are barred from [engaging in grass roots lobbying on official time]" under the Act, but "whether any particular activity would violate the [Act] will depend on the specific facts."[18] It went on to state that the Act applies "only 'in the absence of express authorization by Congress,'" and, citing <span class="Italic">Army</span>, it found that the Statute provided express authorization for union representatives to use official time for <span class="Italic">direct</span> lobbying on representational issues" under &#x00A7; 7102(1) of the Statute.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[19] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 181.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the entity tasked with enforcing the Act has provided a legal opinion that direct lobbying on official time is not prohibited by the Act. The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Army</span>, addressing only <span class="Italic">direct</span> lobbying, is consistent with that holding. However, in accordance with guidance from the Department of Justice, the plain text of the Statute, and Authority precedent, we clarify that the Statute does not expressly authorize "indirect" or "grass roots" lobbying by union representatives on official time, as the Department of Justice and OLC have defined those terms. Therefore, "indirect" or "grass roots" lobbying by union representatives on official time is prohibited by the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Central to" the OLC's analysis in the 2005 opinion was "the distinction between direct and 'grass roots' lobbying."[20] This distinction, the OLC noted, "has been <span class="Italic">extensively</span> applied in decisions of our Office and the Government Accountability Office...dealing with lobbying government officials."[21] As relevant to the use of official time for lobbying, "direct lobbying" would be, for example, <span class="Italic">direct communications</span> between union representatives and government officials on "any legislation, law, ratification, policy or appropriation" related to representational matters,[22] whereas "indirect" or "grass roots" lobbying would be a union representative "encourag[ing] members of the public," including other union members, "to pressure...Congress," or other government officials, with respect to "any legislation, law, ratification, policy or appropriation."[23] "Indirect" or "grass roots" lobbying might involve, for example, "a clear appeal by" a union to its members "to contact congressional members in support of" the union's position on pending legislation.[24]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 179. We note that the OLC provided citations to several previous Comptroller General and OLC opinions and guidelines applying the distinction between "direct" and "grass roots" lobbying. In this opinion, like the 2005 opinion, "indirect" and "grass roots" lobbying are used synonymously.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">While &#x00A7; 7102 guarantees union representatives the right to engage in "direct lobbying[, it] does not mention the presentation of views to members of the public...[or] a request that the public contact government officials."[25] Therefore, the OLC concluded, the Statute does not constitute an express authorization that would create an exception to the Act for indirect lobbying.[26] The Authority hereby adopts the analysis set forth in the 2005 opinion.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that <span class="Italic">Army</span> or any other previous Authority decisions[27] may be read to suggest that <span class="Italic">any</span> union lobbying on official time is expressly authorized by Congress under the Statute, the Authority now clarifies that only "direct" lobbying is expressly authorized. "Indirect" or "grass roots" lobbying is prohibited by the Act and is not expressly authorized by the Statute.[28] We agree with the 2005 opinion that any suggestion that &#x00A7; 7102(1) expressly authorizes "[c]ommunicating <span class="Italic">with the public</span>...to make common cause with the employees' collective[-]bargaining representative"[29] goes "astray from the statutory text."[30] That is, the Statute's guarantee of the right to directly "present the view of [a] labor organization to heads of agencies and other officials of the executive branch of the Government, the Congress, or other appropriate authorities"[31] cannot "reasonably be said to give an 'express authorization' for urging the public to communicate with government officials."[32]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., HHS, SSA</span>, 11 FLRA 7, 8 (1983) (finding no violation of the Act where a union representative called Members of Congress to discuss the agency's appropriations); <span class="Italic">see also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians Razorback Chapter 117</span>, 56 FLRA 427, 430 (2000) (finding a provision negotiable that allows union officials to engage in representational lobbying concerning legislation or appropriation and therefore excluded from the Act); <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md.,</span> 54 FLRA 600 (1998) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>) (finding that the Act did not prohibit union officials from using official time to lobby).

<p class="noindent-1">The dissent--failing to comprehend that the Act is triggered only when appropriated funds are being used--entirely, and unjustifiably, misconstrues the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, FAA Great Lakes Region, Des Plaines, Illinois</span> (<span class="Italic">DOT</span>).[33] In that case, the Authority upheld a remedy directing an agency to "permit [u]nion representatives to 'ask employees to support the [u]nion's views and positions on legislative issues during nonworking times.'"[34] The crucial phrase from that remedy, that the dissent either avoids or overlooks, is "during nonworking time."[35] In plain terms, the remedy in <span class="Italic">DOT</span> concerned union representatives' and union members' right to lobby Congress while in an <span class="Italic">unpaid</span> and non-work status. Nothing in the Act, or this policy statement, affects federal employees' ability to lobby Congress--whether it be directly or indirectly--during their unpaid time. Instead, as we have succinctly stated, the Act precludes the use of official time--i.e., appropriated funds--for indirect lobbying. Thus, the dissent's reliance on that case is misplaced, as <span class="Italic">DOT</span> did not involve the use of official time.[36]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[36] With regard to the Authority's discussion, in <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, of the Act's applicability, that discussion constituted <span class="Italic">dictum</span> and, consequently, is not precedential. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council of Prison Locals # 33, Local Union No. 922</span>, 69 FLRA 480, 480 n.2 (2016) (a judicial comment made while delivering a judicial opinion that is unnecessary to the decision in the case is not precedential).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the finding in <span class="Italic">DOT</span> that union members are not "members of the public," within the meaning of the 2005 opinion, due to a "special relationship" with a union, cannot withstand scrutiny.[37] Indeed, the 2005 opinion <span class="Italic">dealt with this very issue</span>, citing approvingly the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colorado</span> (<span class="Italic">Lowry</span>).[38] <span class="Italic">Lowry</span> held that an agency's direction to an employee not to send a union-drafted letter to a congresswoman did not interfere with the employee's &#x00A7; 7102(1) right "to present the views of the labor organization to...Congress," because the letter was "intended to be adopted and sent by individual employees <span class="Italic">as a statement of their own individual views and not as their presentation to the Congress of the views of the Union</span>."[39] If the OLC's 2005 opinion intended to create a bright-line rule that union members are not "members of the public" for purposes of the Act, its citation to <span class="Italic">Lowry</span> would make no sense. With respect to the views of individual union members who have been encouraged by their union to pressure Congress, or other government officials, under their own name, it is the individual "member[&#8197;] of the public, not the union representative[&#8197;]" who is "making the presentation," and the "views that government officials receive" are "presented as the public's views, rather than 'the views of the labor organization.'"[40] There is simply no logical reason why communications to or from individual union members under their own names that are not presented as "the views of the labor organization" by an employee acting for a union "in the capacity of a representative" should be treated any different from any other communications from a member of the public.[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[43] Although the Foundation's request for a general statement of policy or guidance did not rely on Executive Order 13,837, it would be short-sighted not to review this policy for consistency with the Executive Order.

However, in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 122 and VARO, Atlanta</span>, 47 FLRA 1118, 1122-27 (1993), a proposal was negotiable that union officials be permitted a reasonable amount of official time to represent federal employees by visiting, phoning and writing to elected representatives to support or oppose legislative initiatives:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain wording of the Union's proposal provides for the use of official time by Union representatives to represent Federal employees by visiting, phoning, and writing to elected representatives in support of or opposition to legislation which could affect the working conditions of the employees represented by the Union. The proposal does not require the approval of any specific amount of official time. The proposal merely provides that Union officials shall be permitted to use a reasonable amount of official time for the purpose of presenting the Union's views to Members of Congress on matters affecting the conditions of employment of unit employees. The issue is whether the proposal authorizing official time for that purpose is negotiable under the Statute. For the following reasons, we find that the proposal is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals requiring that employees be granted official time for representational activities are negotiable under section 7131(d) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span>, 45 FLRA 339, 346-55 (1992) (<span class="Italic">BATF</span>) (Member Armendariz, dissenting in part as to other matters), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed</span> No. 92-1370 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 17, 1992). In <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, we stated that, in our view, "Congress intended by section 7131(d) of the Statute to authorize unions to negotiate over the use of official time for representational activity<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 347....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2050 and Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 45 FLRA 289 (1992) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>), we held that official time for representational activities involving the exercise of employee rights under section 7102 of the Statute was negotiable under section 7131(d) of the Statute. In that case, we found that employees, acting as union representatives, who publicize matters affecting unit employees' conditions of employment, are engaged in representational activity that is protected under section 7102 of the Statute. We also found that, because section 7131(d) authorizes official time for such representational activity, a proposal providing official time for employees serving as union representatives to respond to inquiries from the media or public concerning matters affecting unit employees' conditions of employment was negotiable under section 7131(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have also held that official time for representational purposes negotiated under section 7131(d) of the Statute must relate to labor-management relations activities....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, we conclude that the proposal in this case concerns representational activity for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d) of the Statute. Section 7102 of the Statute contemplates that employees will express their views to Congress through their exclusive representative and specifically grants employees functioning as union <span id="Page_280"></span>representatives the right "to present the views of the labor organization to...the Congress[.]" A union representing Federal employees may have particular representational interests in lobbying Congress because Congress may determine directly many conditions of employment of Federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 649 (1990) (the Court stated that the "wages and fringe benefits of the overwhelming majority of Executive Branch employees are fixed by law...and are, therefore..." nonnegotiable under the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in <span class="Italic">Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</span>, 431 U.S. 209 (1977) (<span class="Italic">Abood</span>), the Supreme Court stated that the "process of establishing a written collective-bargaining agreement prescribing the terms and conditions of public employment may require not merely concord at the bargaining table, but subsequent approval by other public authorities; related budgetary and appropriations decisions might be seen as an integral part of the bargaining process." <span class="Italic">Abood</span>, 431 U.S. at 236. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty</span> <span class="Italic">Association</span>, 111 S. Ct. 1950 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Lehnert</span>), the Court recognized that "[p]ublic-sector unions often expend considerable resources in securing ratification of negotiated agreements by the proper state or local legislative body." <span class="Italic">Lehnert</span>, 111 S. Ct. at 1959. The Court noted that "union efforts to acquire appropriations for approved collective-bargaining agreements often serve as an indispensable prerequisite to their implementation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court stated that "[t]he dual roles of government as employer and policymaker in such cases make the analogy between lobbying and collective bargaining in the public sector a close one." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">Abood</span> and <span class="Italic">Lehnert</span> are instructive as to the connection between lobbying activities and the collective bargaining functions of a public sector union, those cases are not controlling here. <span class="Italic">Abood</span> and <span class="Italic">Lehnert</span> concerned the constitutional limitations on the use by a union of agency fees paid by public sector employees who are not union members. The Court found that the use of non-member agency fees for activities that are pertinent to the duties of a public sector union as a bargaining representative did not violate the constitutional rights of non-member employees. In particular, the court held in <span class="Italic">Lehnert</span> that public sector unions may constitutionally subsidize lobbying activities with non-member agency fees so long as those activities are pertinent to the duties of the union as a bargaining representative. However, the Court found that because the lobbying activities at issue in that case related to the financial support of the employee's profession or public employees generally, and did not relate to the ratification or implementation of the non-member's collective bargaining agreement, "the connection to the Union's function as bargaining representative [was] too attenuated to justify compelled [financial] support by objecting employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1959-60. The issues addressed in <span class="Italic">Abood</span> and <span class="Italic">Lehnert</span> are not the issues involved in this case and, therefore, those cases are not dispositive in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal in this case authorizes official time, under section 7131(d) of the Statute, for unit employees who are serving as union representatives to contact Members of Congress with respect to matters pertaining to unit employees' conditions of employment. Consequently, the proposal authorizes official time for a matter that constitutes representational activity under section 7131(d) of the Statute. We emphasize, however, that to be consistent with the requirement in section 7131(d) that official time be granted for representational purposes, an employee's right to appear before Congress or conduct lobbying activities on official time is appropriate only if the employee is functioning as a union representative and only if the matters concerning which the employee is lobbying pertain to unit employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the official time authorized by the proposal relates to labor-management relations activities. In our view, the phrase "labor-management relations activities" as used in <span class="Italic">Mine Safety</span> and <span class="Italic">INS</span> includes activities "in connection with any other matter covered by [the Statute]" within the meaning of section 7131(d) of the Statute. Specifically, the phrase includes the right of employees under section 7102 to represent the labor organization that is their exclusive representative by presenting the views of that organization to Congress concerning matters pertaining to their conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211 (providing that the "right of employees, individually or collectively, to petition Congress or a Member of Congress, or to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied"). The proposal in this case authorizes official time for the purpose of allowing Union representatives to present the views of the Union to Congress concerning matters pertaining to the conditions of employment of unit employees. Accordingly, we find that the proposal in this case concerns labor-management relations activities for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 45 FLRA at 399-401 (the use of official time to represent employees or to serve as a personal representative in appeals procedures before the Merit Systems Protection Board does not relate to labor-management relations activities under section 7131(d) of the Statute); <span class="Italic">Mine Safety</span>, 39 FLRA at 552-54 (official time for attending an Office of Workers' Compensation Programs hearing does not relate to labor-management relations activities under section 7131(d) of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Commander Naval Air</span> <span class="Italic">Pacific, San Diego, California and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington</span>, 41 FLRA 662 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Naval Air Pacific</span>). In <span class="Italic">Naval Air Pacific</span>, the issue, as relevant here, was whether information requested by the union for use in lobbying Congress was necessary for collective bargaining within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. We dismissed the complaint in that case, holding that "any connection between the [u]nion's lobbying efforts and its broad representational responsibilities under the Statute was too attenuated to support a conclusion that the requested information was 'necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining[,]' under section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 673. In this regard, we noted, among other things, that "nothing in the record show[ed] that the [union's information] request was related to any pending or contemplated Congressional action related to unit employees' conditions of employment or the [u]nion's representational responsibilities in connection with such matters." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 672.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the proposal in <span class="Italic">Naval Air Pacific</span>, the proposal in this case would provide a reasonable amount of official time for Union officials to represent bargaining unit employees for the sole purpose of lobbying elected representatives concerning "pending or desired legislation which would impact the working conditions of employees represented by [the Union]." Thus, the issue in this case is whether lobbying activities by Union officials on behalf of unit employees in connection with pending or desired legislation pertaining to unit employees' conditions of employment constitute representational activities for which official time may be authorized under section 7131(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>. Unlike the proposal in this case, the proposal in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span> required the agency to grant official time to bargaining unit employees for visits to their Congressman for any job-related reason. The Authority found that the proposal in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span> did "not specifically concern representational matters but would require the [a]gency to grant" official time under section 7131(d) of the Statute "broadly to any bargaining unit employee regardless of whether or not the employee is representing an exclusive representative." <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, 19 FLRA at 1029. The Authority determined that the proposal was nonnegotiable because it was "inconsistent with the requirement of section 7131(d) that such official time may be granted only for representational matters." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As we stated above, the proposal in this case provides official time only for unit employees serving as Union representatives to engage in representational activity pertaining to unit employees' conditions of employment. Therefore, it is distinguishable from the proposal in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, which required official time for any bargaining unit employee to visit his or her Congressman without regard to whether the employee was serving as a union representative engaged in representational activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union's proposal provides for a grant of official time that is consistent with section 7131(d) of the Statute, we conclude that the proposal is negotiable under section 7131(d) of the Statute....</p>

The proposal in <span class="Italic">N.H. NG</span> was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Association officials will be granted not to exceed two days annually, official time to represent the bargaining unit by visiting, phoning, and writing to elected representatives in support of or opposition to pending desired legislation which would impact the working conditions of employees represented by the Association.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA determined the <span class="Italic">N.H. NG</span> proposal nonnegotiable in a ULP case alleging an improper refusal to bargain, 54 FLRA at 302-13:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent refused to bargain over the proposal on the ground that the proposal was inconsistent with the anti-lobbying provisions of both 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 and the DOD Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-61, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8001, 8015, 109 Stat. 636, 651-54 (1996). The Respondent claimed that the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">VA Atlanta</span> did not consider the anti-lobbying provisions of either statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the Respondent's refusal to bargain, the General Counsel issued an unfair labor practice complaint alleging that the Respondent violated the Statute by refusing to bargain over a proposal substantially identical to a proposal previously found negotiable by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions of the Parties</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Respondent's Position</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts that it did not violate the Statute because the Union's proposal is inconsistent with law. The Respondent argues that the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">VA Atlanta</span> "conflicts with provisions of law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1913,...31 USC 1341...[and the] recurring <span id="Page_281"></span>anti-lobbying provisions in [the] Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Act."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Respondent claims that 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 does not allow the use of appropriated funds in any manner intended to influence a Member of Congress.[2] According to the Respondent, communications by Agency personnel are prohibited unless such communications are "through the proper official channels" or "on a request of Congress." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 5. The Respondent contends that the Union's lobbying activities do not constitute communications through proper official channels, that there is no request by Congress for such activities, and that neither section 7102 nor section 7131 of the Statute expressly authorize Union officials to lobby Congress. Thus, the Respondent argues that granting official time under the circumstances presented would violate 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. The Respondent maintains that the language of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 is unambiguous and, therefore, "recourse to legislative history to define the prohibition's scope is improper."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any personal service, advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, to favor or oppose, by vote or otherwise, any legislation or appropriation by Congress...; but this shall not prevent officers or employees of the United States or of its departments or agencies from communicating to Members of Congress on the request of any Member or to Congress, through the proper official channels, requests for legislation or appropriations which they deem necessary for the efficient conduct of the public business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Respondent asserts that both section 8001 and section 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act contain provisions restricting lobbying with appropriated funds.[3] The Respondent claims that a "failure to adhere to the anti-lobbying provisions in the DOD Appropriations Act would be a violation of [t]he Purpose Statute, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a),...[which] could cause a violation of the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1341."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 8001 of the DOD Appropriations Act provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes not authorized by the Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Department of Defense Appropriation Act, Pub. L. No. 104-61, &#x00A7; 8001, 109 Stat. 636, 651 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 8015 of the DOD Appropriations Act provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used in any way, directly or indirectly, to influence congressional action on any legislation or appropriation matters pending before the Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00A7; 8015, 109 Stat. at 654.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Atlanta</span>, 47 FLRA at 1121-22, the Authority found negotiable the following proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[U]nion officials shall be permitted a reasonable amount of Official time to represent Federal Employees by visiting, phoning and writing to elected representatives in support or opposition to pending or desired legislation which would impact the working conditions of employees represented by NFFE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found, on the basis of sections 7102(1) and 7131(d) of the Statute, that the proposal was within the duty to bargain, provided that: (1) the employees subject to the proposal functioned as union representatives; (2) the subject of the lobbying pertained to unit employees' conditions of employment; and (3) the grant of official time related to labor management activities. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1126-27.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the proposal in this case and the proposal in <span class="Italic">VA Atlanta</span> authorize official time to union officials to lobby Congress on representational matters. No substantive differences are asserted, or apparent, between the proposals. Accordingly, we conclude that the Charging Party's proposal is substantially identical to the proposal the Authority found negotiable in <span class="Italic">VA Atlanta</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Respondent's Duty to Bargain Under the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-established that proposals that affect conditions of employment and that are otherwise consistent with law, rule, and regulation are encompassed by a party's duty to bargain under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools (Alexandria, Virginia) and Overseas Federation of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO</span>, 27 FLRA 586, 601 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Overseas Federation of Teachers</span>). The question presented in this case is whether the proposal is outside the Respondent's duty to bargain because it is contrary to the anti-lobbying provisions of either 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 or the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003; <span class="Italic">The Proposal is Not Contrary to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, 11 FLRA 7, the Authority rejected an agency argument that 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 prohibits Union representatives from conducting lobbying activities on official time. Recently, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, Memphis District, Memphis, Tennessee and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 259</span>, 52 FLRA 920 (1997) (Member Armendariz dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>), the Authority once again examined whether 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 prohibits the use of official time for union officials to lobby Congress. After considering the plain wording of the statute,[6] its legislative history, relevant court decisions, and the administrative opinions of the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office, the Authority concluded that authorizing official time for union officials to lobby on representational issues does not violate 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. Specifically, the Authority determined that section 7131(d) of the Statute constitutes an express authorization to grant official time for representational lobbying and, therefore, section 7131(d) is an exception to the prohibition against lobbying contained in 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The Respondent describes the plain wording of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 as containing only two exceptions to the restriction on lobbying--where the views are presented at the request of a member of Congress or where the views are presented through proper official channels. However, by its express terms, 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 contains an additional exception to the restriction on lobbying: for conduct that is expressly authorized by Congress. The Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span> relied on this exception. The Authority has already considered essentially the same arguments raised by the Respondent herein in the <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span> decision and has rejected viewing the plain wording of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 as prohibiting the conduct proposed in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Respondent has not provided any new arguments supporting a conclusion that the granting of official time to Union officials to lobby Congress violates 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003; <span class="Italic">The Proposal is Contrary to the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The particular appropriation act provisions at issue here--sections 8001 and 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act--are general provisions that restrict lobbying and related matters.[8] As the Respondent is subject to the lobbying restrictions contained in the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act, it is appropriate to examine whether the proposal is consistent with these provisions. Our examination is aided by consideration of the plain wording of these provisions and the administrative opinions of the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Appropriation acts often contain conditions either "restricting the availability of the appropriations or making them available for some particular use." <span class="Italic">Principles of Federal Appropriations Law</span> 2-28 (2d ed. 1991) (<span class="Italic">PFA</span>). These conditions are found in two forms: provisos and general provisions. As relevant here, a general provision is separate from the appropriating language of the legislation and "may apply solely to the act in which it is contained...or it may have general applicability[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> General provisions may be phrased as either "restrictions or positive authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a. <span class="Italic">&#x00A7; 8001 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 8001 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used for publicity and propaganda purposes <span class="Italic">not authorized by the Congress</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No, 104-61, &#x00A7; 8001, 109 Stat. 636, 651 (1996) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain wording of section 8001 expressly prohibits the expenditure of Federal funds for purposes "not authorized by Congress." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As the allotment of official time results in payment of wages or salary, it is an expenditure of appropriated funds.[12] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 4-23. Thus, unless the proposed conduct either does not constitute "publicity and propaganda," or is for a purpose expressly authorized by Congress, the provision of official time would be contrary to section 8001 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12] None of the parties dispute that the payment of official time is an expenditure of Federal funds. In this regard, the Charging Party offers no support, and none is otherwise apparent, for its claim that the dispositive issue is whether employees are "on duty" during the lobbying activities for which official time would be granted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons explained more fully in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 52 FLRA 920, sections 7102(1) and 7131(d) constitute express Congressional authorization for agencies to grant official time for employee union representatives to lobby Congress on representational issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, 52 FLRA at 932. Section 7102 provides that employees, acting in their representational capacity, have the right to present the views of their labor organization to Congress and to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In subsection (d) of section 7131 of the Statute, Congress provided that union <span id="Page_282"></span>representatives should be granted official time in any amount that the parties agreed to be reasonable, necessary and in the public interest "in connection with <span class="Italic">any other matter covered</span>" by the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 933 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d)). Representation lobbying is plainly a matter covered by section 7102 of the Statute. As such, the express language of section 7131(d) permits official time for this purpose where the agency and the union agree. The fact that Congress expressly authorized official time for matters covered by the Statute demonstrates that Congress expressly authorized the use of appropriated funds for the proposed activities in this case as long as the parties agree that 2 days is a reasonable amount of time. Accordingly, based on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, we find that the proposal in this case is not inconsistent with section 8001 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003; <span class="Italic">&#x00A7; 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">None of the funds made available by this Act shall be used in any way, directly or indirectly, to influence congressional action on any legislation or appropriation matters pending before the Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-61, &#x00A7; 8015, 636, 654 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain wording of section 8015 expressly prohibits the use of appropriated funds to engage in <span class="Italic">any</span> discussion referring to pending legislation or appropriations. Unlike section 8001 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act, section 8015 does not contain any express exceptions. In particular, there is no exception permitting the use of appropriated funds for discussions concerning pending legislation or appropriations. As such, this provision does not contain the language that was central to our finding that 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 and section 8001 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act do not bar representational lobbying. Moreover, the fact that Congress included the exception in section 8001 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act and not in section 8015 of that Act must be given meaning. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp.</span>, 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994) ("'[I]t is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another[.]'") (citing <span class="Italic">Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund</span>, 511 U.S. 328, 338 (1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's proposal clearly states that union officials "will be granted official time...[to contact Congress] in support of or opposition to <span class="Italic">pending</span> desired <span class="Italic">legislation</span>[.]" Because the Union's proposal requires the use of appropriated funds to influence pending legislation, and because section 8015 plainly prohibits use of appropriate funds to directly or indirectly influence pending legislation, we find that the proposal is inconsistent with section 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act. The legislation does not authorize any exceptions to this prohibition, and there is no basis for the Authority to create an exception that Congress has not stated. Consequently, we conclude that the proposal is contrary to law, and that the Respondent was not obligated to bargain with the Union over it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not find that GAO's interpretations of provisions similar to section 8015 support the conclusion reached by our dissenting colleague. In this regard, GAO has interpreted such provisions as "applying primarily to indirect or grass roots lobbying and not to direct contact with Members of Congress." However, GAO's description of the primary application of these provisions does not define their "exclusive" application. Moreover, GAO's prior interpretations of provisions similar to section 8015 were all rendered in connection with questions regarding activities by <span class="Italic">agency</span>--not union--officials. In particular, GAO's interpretation was based on its view that Congress did not intend by creating such provisions to restrict the normal course of communication among the three branches of government. <span class="Italic">See</span> 63 Comp. Gen. 624 (1984) (contact by federal judges and legislative liaison activities by the Judicial Conference of the United States did not violate publicity and propaganda provisions; contrary interpretation of such provisions would "preclude virtually any comment by Government officials on the policies of their agencies[.]")....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the proposal does not concern communications among the three branches of government. Rather, the proposal concerns communications by <span class="Italic">union</span>--not agency--officials acting in their role as bargaining unit representatives. Union expressions of bargaining unit views on pending legislation are not part of the normal course of communication between officials of the Executive and Legislative branches of Government on agency or administrative policy and activities. In these circumstances, we do not read GAO's previous interpretations of similar pending legislation provisions to address the question presented here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find no merit to the Charging Party's assertion that the Statute should prevail over the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act because it is a more specific statute. Section 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act expressly prohibits the use of appropriations for any purpose intended to influence Congress on pending legislation or appropriations. In contrast, section 7131(d) authorizes official time for any "matter covered by" the Statute, including, among others, presenting the views of the union to Congress as authorized by section 7102 of the Statute. We are unable to conclude that this language in the Statute is more specific than the explicit and targeted prohibition in section 8015. In addition, canons of statutory construction provide that, where two statutes conflict, the later and more specific statute usually controls over the earlier and more general one. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 824 F.2d 1258, 1278 (1st Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Detweiler v. Pena</span>, 38 F.3d 591 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Thus, the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act prevails over the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we are compelled to conclude that the Union's proposal is contrary to section 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act. Accordingly, the Respondent did not violate sections 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute when it refused to bargain over the Union's proposal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Federation of Teachers</span>, 27 FLRA at 601.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Granite State Chap.</span> was affirmed on review, <span class="Italic">Granite State Chap., ACT v. FLRA</span>, 173 F.3d 25, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the elementary proposition that one Congress is not bound by the decisions of a previous Congress<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Reichelderfer v. Quinn</span>, 287 U.S. 315, 318, 53 S. Ct. 177, 77 L. Ed. 331 (1932); <span class="Italic">Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Maine, </span>75 F.3d 784, 789 (1st Cir. 1996). Times change, and Congress repeals some laws, adjusts others and passes new legislation to meet the challenges of the day and of own policy preferences. In most instances, Congress is explicit about its intent to change the law. In other cases, however, Congress is not so clear; the repeal is not explicit. Although repeal by implication is disfavored, especially in instances in which an appropriations bill is claimed to have repealed substantive law, <span class="Italic">United States v. Will</span>, 449 U.S. 200, 221-22, 101 S. Ct. 417, 66 L. Ed.2d 392 (1980), it is not forbidden. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 222-24, 101 S. Ct. 471; <span class="Italic">Metlife</span> <span class="Italic">Capital Corp. v. M/V EMILY S., </span>132 F.3d 818, 821-22 (1st Cir. 1997). If one Congress clearly and manifestly makes known its intent to supplant an existing law, a court can find repeal by implication. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Metlife Capital</span>, 132 F.3d at 822. Where, for example, two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict, the later law, in whole or in part, constitutes a repeal of the former. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is such a case.&#x2003;The 104th Congress picked its terms carefully, and we must give them their full effect. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp.</span>, 511 U.S. 531, 537, 114 S. Ct. 1757, 128 L. Ed.2d 556 (1994). It chose unambiguous and unqualified language--"none," "in any way," "directly or indirectly." This pleonasm leaves no room for doubt; Congress simply changed its mind. The presence of exceptions in other anti-lobbying provisions, including 18 USC &#x00A7; 1913 and &#x00A7; 8001 of the Act, only bolsters this conclusion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United Technologies</span> <span class="Italic">Corp. v. Browning-Ferris Ind., Inc., </span>33 F.3d 96, 100-101 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1996, Congress decided that Department of Defense funds should not be used for lobbying and drafted and passed an appropriations act to make this clear. For that fiscal year, &#x00A7; 8015 repealed the Union's right to lobby Congress on official time as otherwise guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. Thus, the Union's proposal conflict with &#x00A7; 8015; the National Guard was under no obligation to negotiate over the proposal; and the Authority's dismissal of the unfair labor practice charge is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT Old Hickory Chap. and DOD, N.C. NGB</span>, 55 FLRA 811, 813 (1999), reached the same result under the 1998 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 105-56, 111 Stat. 1203, 1219, 1222 (1998), and rejected a distinction that the union attempted to draw between duty and nonduty time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the provision is not contrary to the Defense Appropriation Lobbying Statute because official time, like annual leave, does not constitute duty time, ignores a critical distinction between official time and annual leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee on official time under section 7131 is permitted to engage in particular activities, designated by the Statute, during the time when the employee otherwise would be in a duty status. The purpose of official time is to permit employees to engage in these activities without loss of pay or leave. The activities that may be performed by employees on official time are restricted in two ways. First, the Statute specifies that only certain activities may be performed on official time: negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement (section 7131(a)), participation in FLRA proceedings (section 7131(c)), and representation in connection with other matters covered by the Statute (section 7131(d)). Second, the Statute prohibits employees from performing other activities--internal union business, including the solicitation of membership, elections of labor organization officials, and collection of dues--on official time<span class="Italic">. See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, annual leave constitutes payment to an employee for activities already performed by the employee. The purpose of annual leave is to compensate employees for work already performed--not for activities performed while on annual leave. Indeed, an employee can, upon separation from government employment, receive a lump-sum payment for accrued, but unused, annual leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5551. While on annual leave, an employee is not subject to the restrictions in section <span id="Page_283"></span>7131. That is, activities that may not be conducted on official time--such as internal union business--may be conducted by an employee on annual leave. <span class="Italic">Cf. New Hampshire National Guard</span>, 173 F.3d at 28 n.3 (court concluded that although the Defense Appropriate Lobbying Statute restricted use of official time, it did not "in any way affect what Union members can do during their annual leave.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union essentially argues that there are only two categories of employee time: duty time and nonduty time. This is mistaken. Section 7131 of the Statute creates a distinct third category of time: official time, when an employee is performing representational functions for the union while receiving compensation from the agency. Unlike regular duty time, an employee's activities on official time are not directed by the agency. Unlike annual leave, an employee's activities on official time are restricted by the Statute. In this connection, we note that both official time and duty time--unlike nonduty time such as annual leave--"shall be considered hours of work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.424(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The distinction the Union draws between duty time and non-duty time does not persuade us that the Authority erred in determining that the use of official time to lobby Congress is inconsistent with the Defense Appropriation Lobbying Statute. <span class="Italic">Nevada Air National Guard;</span> <span class="Italic">New Hampshire National Guard; and Georgia Department of Defense</span>....</p>

FLRA</span>, 269 F.3d 1119 (D.C. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">ACT v. FLRA</span>, 269 F.3d 1119, 1122-23 (D.C. Cir. 2001), the D.C. Circuit accepted FLRA 's interpretation of the provisions of the DOD Appropriations Act, &#x00A7; 8012, precluding appropriated funds (and official time) for lobbying:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress expressed a clear intent to prohibit the use "in any way" of "funds made available by the [DOD Appropriations] Act" to "influence congressional action on <span class="Italic">any</span> legislation or appropriation matters pending before the Congress." Appropriations Act &#x00A7; 8012 (emphasis added). Twice before, our sister circuits have addressed this very issue, involving the same labor union, similar, if not identical bargaining provision language, and identical predecessor DOD appropriations acts<span class="Italic">. Granite State</span>, 173 F.3d at 27-28; <span class="Italic">Silver Barons</span>, 200 F.3d at 592-93. And unsurprisingly, twice before, our sister circuits have affirmed the Authority's determination that the disputed provision was contrary to law and therefore nonnegotiable. Perhaps the Union believed the third time would be the charm. It is not. Nothing has changed--not the crux of the provision in dispute, and not the appropriations act language, and therefore we see no reason to depart from our sister circuits' good company. The Appropriations Act prohibits the disputed provision because, as the FLRA has had several occasions to reiterate, official time may only be granted to the extent that it is consistent with all "applicable laws and regulations." <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2015</span>, 41 FLRA at 1185. Here the granting of official time is not consistent with the Appropriations Act. Hardly more needs to be said.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also raises a constitutional argument which we dispense with just as summarily.&#x2003;The Union contends that the FLRA's treatment of the Appropriations Act raises "serious" First Amendment concerns because it leads to the "unacceptable conclusion that employee activities on paid annual leave constitute use of appropriated funds, and that &#x00A7; 8012 therefore prohibits employees from visiting Members of Congress while on annual leave." However, this "unacceptable conclusion" is predicated on there being no difference between annual leave and official time. That is simply not so. The Authority has reasonably distinguished between official time and paid annual leave. <span class="Italic">See North Carolina Guard</span>, 55 F.L.R.A. at 813 (setting out the "critical distinction" between employee use of official time and annual leave). The collective bargaining laws impose restrictions on the use of official time that are not applicable to the use of paid annual leave. Official time is a "distinct third category of time," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, and unlike annual leave, is considered to be "hours of work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.424(b) (2001). Annual leave is compensation for work performed at other times. This First Amendment argument is a red herring. Section 8012, like its predecessors, "does not in any way affect what Union members can do during their annual leave." <span class="Italic">Granite State</span>, 173 F.3d at 28 n.3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, at oral argument, the question arose whether this interpretation of the Appropriations Act would affect lobbying by DOD officials (i.e., the Secretary of Defense or other agency "management") in their official capacity on behalf of the Department and the Executive Branch. Because this issue is not before us, rather only a union's use of "official time," we need not address it, though we do note that applying section 8012 to DOD officials in their official capacity would raise constitutional separation of powers concerns not implicated here. That question would also require us to inquire into longstanding practices of DOD officials in lobbying Congress, to determine whether their actions have placed a "gloss" on Congress's action in enacting section 8012. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">FDA v. Brown &#x0026; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</span>, 529 U.S. 120, 132-33, 137 (2000); <span class="Italic">Cannon v. University of Chicago</span>, 441 U.S. 677, 696-99 (1979). The agency's continued lobbying of Congress in the presence of recurring appropriations act provisions such as section 8012 provides additional background for interpreting such sections not relevant to the case before us.</p>
<p class="noindent">The line of decisions interpreting the various DOD appropriations statutes addressed use of official time to influence pending legislation. Not prohibited, according to <span class="Italic">ACT Razorback Chap. 117 and Nat'l Guard Bureau, Arkansas NG</span>, 56 FLRA 427, 429-31 (2000), was a proposal for official time to visit, phone, and write to elected representatives in support of desired legislation that would impact working conditions. The 1999 DOD Appropriations Act contained &#x00A7; 8012, similar to the earlier legislative &#x00A7; 8015, prohibiting the use of funds to influence congressional action on legislation or appropriations matters pending before Congress. 18 USC 1913 precludes the use of appropriated funds to directly or indirectly pay for communications designed to influence a congressman to favor or oppose, "by vote or otherwise" any legislation or appropriations by Congress. That statute contained a specific exclusion for federal employees communicating with congressmen, through proper official channels, requests for legislation or appropriations they deem "necessary for the efficient conduct of public business":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Section 8012 of the 1999 DOD Appropriations Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not view pending legislation and desired legislation as synonymous terms, and thus, disagree with the Agency's claim that the inclusion of the word "desired," as opposed to "pending," is a minor change that does not alter the basic meaning or intent of the provision. In determining whether the provision at issue should be treated in the same fashion as proposals or provisions that involved pending legislation, we adopt the parties' agreed upon meaning for the term "desired legislation," as legislation that the union officials wish to see enacted, but that has not yet been introduced by the House of Representatives or Senate at the time of the officials' lobbying activities. In this regard, we note that this definition comports with the plain meaning or dictionary definition of the word "desired" as "that [which] is longed or hoped for[.]" Webster's Unabridged Third New International Dictionary (1986) at 612.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Desired legislation, as defined above by the parties, is separate and distinct from the plain meaning of "pending" as used in the DOD Appropriations Act and the proposals/provisions previously examined by the Authority. The Authority has not specifically defined the term "pending" in its prior cases regarding official time for lobbying activities. The Union explains, and it is undisputed, that "pending," as used in earlier cases, is "the same concept" as the word "pending" in the appropriation acts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under principles of statutory interpretation, undefined terms in a statute are understood to have their ordinary meaning. <span class="Italic">Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. v. United States</span>, 36 F.3d 1565, 1571 n.9 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Black's Law Dictionary defines "pending" as "begun, but not yet completed; before the conclusion of, prior to the completion of" Black's Law Dictionary 1134 (6th ed. 1990). In line with the plain meaning of the word pending, and the Union's explanation, we find that the scope of section 8012's prohibition against the use of appropriated funds for lobbying "on any legislation or appropriation matters pending before the Congress" is limited to legislation or bills that have been introduced for consideration by Congress but have not been enacted into law or voted down (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, legislative process officially commenced but not yet completed). Thus, considering the plain meaning of pending legislation, demonstrated above to be distinct from desired legislation, leads us to conclude that a provision granting official time for lobbying regarding desired legislation falls outside the scope of the Appropriations Act's prohibition against lobbying regarding pending legislation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, we reject the Agency's argument that the provision is contrary to section 8012 of the DOD Appropriations Act based on GAO's definition of prohibited grass roots lobbying. In <span class="Italic">New Hampshire National Guard,</span> the majority, in response to then-Member Wasserman's dissent, noted that although GAO had interpreted provisions similar to section 8015 (predecessor to section 8012) concerning pending legislation, GAO's opinions "did not address the question presented" regarding lobbying Members of Congress by union officials since all of GAO's interpretations were "rendered in connection with questions regarding activities by <span class="Italic">agency--</span>not union--officials." <span class="Italic">New Hampshire National Guard, </span>54 FLRA at 311 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the provision is not contrary to section 8012 of the 1999 DOD Appropriations Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_284"></span>B.&#x2003;Section 8001 of the 1999 DOD Appropriations Act and 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the provision is not contrary to either section 8001 of the 1999 DOD Appropriations Act or 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. The Authority has consistently held that both section 8001 and 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 contain express exceptions that permit the use of appropriated funds for representational lobbying concerning legislation or appropriations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Army,</span> <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers, Memphis District, Memphis, Tennessee and National Federation of Federal Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 259, </span>52 FLRA 920, 932-33 (1997) <span class="Italic">(Corps of</span> <span class="Italic">Engineers); Georgia Department of Defense, </span>54 FLRA at 662-65; <span class="Italic">New Hampshire National Guard, </span>54 FLRA at 306-07, 309; <span class="Italic">Nevada Air National Guard, </span>54 FLRA at 607. In this connection, the plain wording of section 8001 expressly prohibits the use of appropriated funds "for publicity and propaganda purposes <span class="Italic">not authorized</span> <span class="Italic">by the Congress." </span>Similarly, the plain wording of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 expressly prohibits the expenditure of appropriated funds for direct or indirect lobbying, unless <span class="Italic">inter alia, </span>an express authorization by Congress" indicates otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, the Authority stated that sections 7102(1) and 7131(d) of the Statute constitute express congressional authorization for agencies to grant official time for employee union representatives to lobby Congress on representational issues. Specifically, the Authority found that section 7102 provides that employees, acting in their representational capacity, have the right to present the views of their union to Congress and to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment. Moreover, the Authority noted that in subsection (d) of section 7131, Congress provided that union representatives should be granted official time in any amount that the parties agreed to be reasonable, necessary and in the public interest "in connection with any other matter covered" by the Statute.<span class="Italic"> Corps of Engineers, </span>52 FLRA at 933 (quoting section 7131(d) of the Statute). The Authority determined that representational lobbying is plainly a matter covered by section 7102 of the Statute, and as such, the express language of section 7131(d) permits official time for representational lobbying where the agency and the union so agree. <span class="Italic">Georgia Department of Defense, </span>54 FLRA at 662-65.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision at issue plainly involves representational lobbying since the union officials would be lobbying regarding legislation that "would impact the working conditions of [bargaining unit] employees." The distinction between desired legislation and pending legislation demonstrated above does not call into question the representational nature of the lobbying that is the basis for exemption under section 8001 and 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. In addition, the Agency has not provided any new arguments supporting a conclusion that the granting of official time to Union officials to lobby Congress violates section 8001 of the DOD Appropriations Act or 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. Therefore, for the same reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers, </span>and subsequently reaffirmed, we find that the provision is not contrary to section 8001 of the 1999 DOD Appropriations Act or 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913.</p>
<p class="noindent">In an opinion affirming an arbitration award sustaining a contract clause allowing official time for a union representative to promote unit interests through legislative contacts, FLRA construed the Hatch Act and 18 USC 1913 (but not appropriations legislation) in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis and NFFE Local 259</span>, 52 FLRA 920, 926-34 (1997) (clarified in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Right to Work Legal Defense Found., Inc</span>., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-178.html">71 FLRA 923</a>, 923-26 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">supra</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained a grievance claiming that the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement by denying the grievant: (1) official time to lobby Congress during the Union's annual Lobby Week in Washington, D.C.; and (2) leave without pay (LWOP) to attend a series of Union meetings in connection with Lobby Week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has addressed the use of official time for lobbying Congress in three prior decisions. However, none of these decisions fully resolve the arguments presented here.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Authority concluded, without providing its reasoning, that an arbitration award granting official time to lobby Congress was not deficient as contrary to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 in <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees Local 3231</span>, 11 FLRA 7 (1983) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). In two other decisions, the Authority found that bargaining proposals for use of official time to lobby Congress were within the duty to bargain under the Statute. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter</span> <span class="Italic">243, and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark</span> <span class="Italic">Office</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 207 (1994); <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 122 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Regional Office, Atlanta, Georgia</span>, 47 FLRA 1118, 1126-27 (1993). In the latter two decisions, neither the Hatch Act nor 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 was raised.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hatch Act prohibits Federal employees' participation in certain political activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7321 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. Relevant legislative history indicates that Congress' underlying rationale in enacting the Hatch Act was to establish a nonpartisan civil service. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 57, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1993), reprinted in 1993 USCCAN 1802, 1803. Consistent with Congress' intent, and as pertinent here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7324(a)(1) provides that Federal employees "may not engage in political activity" while on duty. The Hatch Act's implementing regulations define "political activity" as "an activity directed toward the success or failure of a <span class="Italic">political party</span>, candidate for <span class="Italic">partisan political office</span>, or <span class="Italic">partisan political group.</span>" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 734.101 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case indicates that the grievant lobbied Congress on issues including pay, downsizing and reorganization, health benefits, civil service reform, protection for temporary employees, and EEO reform. The Agency does not argue, and it is not apparent from the record, that the Union's lobbying activity was directed at the success or failure of any political party, partisan political candidate, or partisan political group. As such, the grievant's lobbying activities do not fall within the regulation's definition of "political activity," and we conclude that the award is not inconsistent with the Hatch Act. <span class="Italic">Cf. Blaylock v. U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 851 F.2d 1348, 1352-54 (11th Cir. 1988) (Hatch Act's prohibition against taking part in political management or political campaign encompasses only active participation in, on behalf of, or in connection with organized efforts of political parties, political clubs, and political candidates).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 is a criminal statute that provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">No part of the money appropriated by any enactment of Congress shall, in the absence of express authorization by Congress, be used directly or indirectly to pay for any personal service, advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, printed or written matter, or other device, intended or designed to influence in any manner a Member of Congress, to favor or oppose, by vote or otherwise, any legislation or appropriation by Congress...; but this shall not prevent officers or employees of the United States or of its departments or agencies from communicating to Members of Congress on the request of any Member or to Congress, through the proper official channels, requests for legislation or appropriations which they deem necessary for the efficient conduct of the public business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our determination of whether the award is contrary to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 is aided by consideration of the provision's plain wording, its legislative history,[7] relevant court decisions,[8] and administrative opinions of the Department of Justice (DOJ) [9], and the General Accounting Office (GAO).[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The legislative history of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 suggests that its enactment was spurred by the use of Federal funds by an agency head urging citizens to contact Congressional representatives in support of legislation benefitting the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 58 Cong. Rec. 403 (1919) (remarks of Rep. Good).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;It is not asserted that there are judicial decisions examining alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 on the merits.

<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel, in an advisory opinion issued in 1989, expressed its view that the statute was enacted "to restrict the use of appropriated funds for large-scale, high-expenditure campaigns specifically urging private recipients to contact Members of Congress about pending legislative matters on behalf of an Administrative position." 13 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 361, 365 (1989).

<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Where the use of public funds is an element of a violation of a statute, such as 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913, GAO is authorized to determine whether Federal funds were used properly. <span class="Italic">Principles</span> <span class="Italic">of Federal Appropriations Law</span>, 1-26 (2d ed. 1991) (<span class="Italic">PFA</span>). In carrying out this responsibility, GAO has stated that 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 "does not prohibit direct communication, solicited or unsolicited[,] between <span id="Page_285"></span>agency officials and Members of Congress...even where the contact is an obvious attempt to influence legislation<span class="Italic">."

Gen. 624, 627 (1984) (contacts by federal judges and legislative liaison activities by the Judicial Conference to Members of Congress did not violate the anti-lobbying statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain wording of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 makes it a crime for any employee or officer of a Federal agency to use money appropriated by Congress to "pay for" certain items. In particular, the prohibition encompasses paying for: (1) specified items (personal service, advertisement, telegram, telephone, letter, printed or written matter, or other device); that are (2) "intended or designed to influence in any manner" a Member of Congress on any legislation or appropriation. There are two exceptions to the prohibition:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;the personal service or other item is a response to a request of any Member of Congress or to Congress through proper official channels and relates to matters necessary for the efficient conduct of public business; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Congress has expressly authorized a statutory exception to the otherwise prohibited payment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The allotment of official time results in use of Federal funds to "pay for" wages or salary. Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, it is clearly subject to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. Moreover, the parties agree, and the record reflects, that the Union's efforts during Lobby Week were aimed at influencing Members of Congress on pending legislation affecting the terms and conditions of bargaining unit employees' employment. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether these particular activities are within the definition of the items prohibited by 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not aware of any precedent squarely deciding whether the Union's lobbying activities constitute a "personal service, telegram, telephone, letter, printed or written matter, or other device," within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913, and the statute does not define these terms. We note, however, the legislative history addressed above, which indicates that, when Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913, it intended to protect its Members from indirect lobbying by agency officials. <span class="Italic">See also NTEU v. Campbell</span>, 654 F.2d at 792. There is no evidence or assertion that the Union representatives in this case were lobbying indirectly on behalf of agency officials. We note also that, in construing section 1913, the Department of Justice has stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Statute prohibits only lobbying that is conducted in the form of the provision of a personal service or advertisement, that is presented in written form, or that is communicated by telephone or "other device." Read in context, the prohibition on other "devices[s]" does not appear to prohibit speeches or other verbal communications that are not relayed by telephone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">13 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 361, 363 (1989). DOJ concluded that the statute did not prohibit "public speeches by Executive Branch employees aimed at generating public support for administrative policies and legislative proposals<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The same reasoning supports a conclusion that the statute does not prohibit the Union's lobbying activities--its oral communications not relayed by telephone--in this case. There also is reason, as set forth by DOJ, for narrowly construing this criminal statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 366.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, there are significant questions whether the Union's lobbying activities are within the definition of the items that Congress prohibited in 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913. However, it is unnecessary to determine whether the Union's activities are encompassed by the statute if one of the two aforementioned exceptions to the prohibition apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first exception, the parties do not claim, and the record does not reflect, that the Union's lobbying activities were in response to any Congressional request. In addition, there is no assertion, or other apparent basis on which to conclude, that the lobbying activities were conducted through "proper official channels." This exception has been interpreted as permitting communications that are cleared through agency officials' supervisors and that represent the official views of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 30, 32 (1978) (citing 58 Cong. Rec. 425 (1919)). In this case, it is uncontroverted that the Agency did not authorize the Union to present the Agency's views, and that the Union presented the views of bargaining unit employees. As such, the first exception does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When Congress enacted the Statute, it recognized that labor organizations and collective bargaining promote an effective and efficient Federal Government. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101. Consistent with this purpose, sections 7102(1) and 7102(2) provide that employees, acting in their representational capacity, have the right to present the views of their labor organization to Congress and to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment.[13] In subsections (a) and (c) of section 7131 of the Statute, Congress authorized use of official time for, respectively, negotiating collective bargaining agreements, and participating in proceedings before the Federal Labor Relations Authority; in subsection (b), Congress expressly prohibited the use of official time for conducting activities relating to internal Union business. Congress also provided in subsection (d) of section 7131 that union representatives should be granted official time in any amount that the parties agreed to be reasonable, necessary and in the public interest "in connection <span class="Italic">with any other matter covered"</span> by the Statute. (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13] The Supreme Court has recognized, in decisions addressing the Constitutionality of expenditures made under agency-shop arrangements, that "[t]he dual roles of government as employer and policymaker...makes the analogy between lobbying and collective bargaining...a close one" requiring public sector unions to be concerned "not only with negotiations at the bargaining table but also with advancing their members' interest in legislative and other 'political' arenas." <span class="Italic">Lehnert</span> <span class="Italic">v. Ferris Faculty Association</span>, 500 U.S. 507, 520 (1991). The Authority has held, and there is no dispute in this case, that Federal employees have a Constitutional right to express their views on terms and conditions of employment to Congress<span class="Italic">. Commander Naval Air Pacific, San Diego, California and Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Air Station Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington</span>, 41 FLRA 662, 671 n.6 (1991) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Collins.</span>, 323 U.S. 516 (1945); <span class="Italic">Thornhill v. Alabama</span>, 310 U.S. 88 (1940); <span class="Italic">Connecticut</span> <span class="Italic">State Federation of Teachers v. Board of Education Members</span>, 538 F.2d 471, 478 (2d Cir. 1976)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Representational lobbying is plainly a matter covered by section 7102(1) of the Statute. As such, the express language of section 7131(d) permits official time for this purpose where the agency and the union agree. In this regard, the fact that Congress expressly authorized official time for matters covered by the Statute persuades us that Congress expressly authorized the use of appropriated funds for lobbying activities. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 13 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 361, 363-64 (1989) (continued appropriations of funds by Congress for positions whose incumbents engage in lobbying activities constitutes authorization for such activities).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, we conclude that the Statute constitutes "an express authorization by Congress" for using Federal funds to grant official time to employees to lobby Congress on representational matters, in such amount as the employing Federal agency and the exclusive representative agree. In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency and the Union had agreed in Article V, Section 5 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement to authorize employees "reasonable time during working hours...to represent employees[,]" and the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant was entitled to official time under the agreement. For reasons set forth in...this decision, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement is not deficient under section 7122(a)(2) of the Statute. As such, we find that the granting of official time in the circumstances of this case is authorized by the Statute and, consequently, is excepted from the sanctions of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913.[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15] Even if we did not conclude that the Statute is an "express authorization by Congress," we would be left with a conflict between the general prohibition against lobbying contained in 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1913 and the specific authorization for representational lobbying contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d). In this connection, applying general principles of statutory construction, the specific is to prevail over the general<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Todd v. M.S.P.B.</span>, 55 F.3d 1574, 1578 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (a statute addressing a narrow, precise, and specific subject is not absorbed by a statute covering a more generalized subject); <span class="Italic">Detweiler v. Pena</span>, 38 F.3d 591, 594 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (if two statutes are capable of coexistence, absent congressional intent to the contrary, each should be regarded as effective); and <span class="Italic">Mail Order Ass'n of America v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 986 F.2d 509, 515 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ("we are to prefer the more specific statute over a conflicting general one.").</p>
