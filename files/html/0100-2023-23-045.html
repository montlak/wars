<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-46"><span class="space">g.</span> Coercion or Bias by Judge</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ properly encourages the parties to try to settle a case. <span class="Italic">Henry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 482, 486 (1989). If it is alleged that the AJ coerced the settlement, the question is whether the AJ put so much pressure on a party as to vitiate that party's consent to enter into the agreement. <span class="Italic">Torrente v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 556, 559 (1992). "Proof of an administrative judge's coercion exists when the evidence shows that an appellant involuntarily accepted terms, that the circumstances permitted no other alternative, and that the circumstances resulted from the administrative judge's coercive acts." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 512, 515 &#x00B6; 6 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 274, 279 (1991), <span class="Italic">post</span>). <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 94 MSPR 669 (2003), noted of an allegation that a settlement was the product of an AJ's bias, "[a]n administrative judge's conduct during the course of a Board proceeding warrants a new adjudication only if the administrative judge's comments or actions evidence 'a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.'" <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 94 MSPR 669, 675 &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Bieber v. Dept. of Army</span>, 287 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 274, 279-83 (1991), presents the current analytical model for allegations that settlements were coerced by AJs. In <span class="Italic">Lee</span> the allegation was that the appellant was forced into a settlement when an AJ who told him he could not win his appeal. Two analytical factors were suggested in <span class="Italic">Lee</span>: whether the AJ put so much pressure on a party as to vitiate the party's consent; alternatively, whether the appellant can overcome an AJ's presumed honesty and show that an AJ's bias affected appellant's settlement of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In the past, the Board has used two basic models to analyze such allegations: (1) coercion of a party into settling a case; and (2) bias against a party to a case. However, we have not always consistently used the same models with allegations of the same type. We find that the nature of the appellant's allegations should determine the model the Board will use in analyzing these allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The coercion test applies where the essential question is whether the administrative judge put so much pressure on a party as to vitiate the party's consent. Specifically, it applies where the appellant alleges that he involuntarily accepted a settlement. In <span class="Italic">Candelaria v. US Postal Service</span>, 31 MSPR 412, 413 (1986), the Board used this model in analyzing an appellant's claim that the administrative judge did not offer him an opportunity to explain his position on the agreement and coerced him into accepting the agreement by advising him that he would not prevail on appeal. However, the Board stated the test in terms of the opposing party's, rather than the administrative judge's, conduct. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Koury v. Small Business Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 177 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 298 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). Thus, we believe the test should be restated as <span id="Page_4808"></span>follows: To prove an allegation that he was coerced by the administrative judge, a party must present evidence that he involuntarily accepted the terms of another, that the circumstances permitted no other alternative, and that the circumstances resulted from the administrative judge's coercive acts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the coercion model applies in the present case. We further find that the appellant has failed to sustain his burden of showing coercion. As previously stated, the appellant responded, "Yes, I do" when asked if he understood and accepted the settlement agreement. Thus, he does not allege that the agreement's terms were not known to him when he signed the agreement. In addition, he did not raise any concerns about coercion until he filed his petition for review. Moreover, the appellant has not pointed to any evidence in the record, or submitted an affidavit or any other evidence, to support his unsworn statements concerning the administrative judge's actions. Thus, we do not find that the appellant proved that the administrative judge coerced him into settling the case....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The bias model applies where the party's allegations revolve around the administrative judge's rulings on legal questions or comments on the strength of the party's case. It also applies where a party refuses to settle the case, and subsequently argues that this refusal affected the administrative judge's adjudication of the merits of the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Singleton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">While not generally applicable to Board proceedings, the disqualification procedures followed under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 USC 551 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (APA), similarly provide that a party seeking to disqualify a presiding or participating employee has the burden of proof and will be allowed to introduce relevant evidence bearing on the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 556(b); 4 J.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that the administrative judge told him, in essence, that he could not win his case should be analyzed as an allegation of bias. However, applying the analytical framework discussed above, we find that the appellant has failed to prove his allegation of bias because he has not overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span>, 37 MSPR at 256. He simply asserts that the administrative judge acted improperly. He has not pointed to any evidence in the record, or submitted an affidavit or any other evidence to support his unsworn statements. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, 39 MSPR at 234-35 (Board remanded case to new administrative judge because of the appearance of impropriety where the appellant's attorney submitted an unrebutted affidavit alleging partiality and unfairness on the part of the administrative judge). Moreover, as noted above, the administrative judge's rulings on the appellant's requested continuance provide no basis for a finding of bias both because they were made during the adjudication of the instant case and because they were an appropriate exercise of the administrative judge's discretion. Thus, we conclude that no further inquiry into the matter is warranted because the appellant failed to raise a timely or sufficient allegation of bias.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Womack v.

Under <span class="Italic">Lee</span> and <span class="Italic">Womack,</span> if a bias allegation is to be preserved for review through a PFR, the appellant must object to the AJ's actions when they occur. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit tends to take a straightforward approach, rejecting an allegation of a coerced settlement in <span class="Italic">Masood v. Dept. of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3377):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Masood argues that the Board should have set aside the settlement agreement because of the AJ's conduct. Mr. Masood asserts that the AJ coerced him to enter into the settlement agreement. In that regard, he complains that the AJ told him, during the last settlement conference after the hearing on the merits, that the AJ was going to rule against him. Because we see no impropriety in the AJ's conduct, we affirm the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Masood fails to point to any evidence to support his allegations of coercion by the AJ. Mr. Masood presented conclusory allegations of coercion by the AJ that are legally insufficient to invalidate the agreement. Mr. Masood had the benefit of being represented by counsel at all settlement conferences, and he failed to produce testimony or affidavits from his counsel concerning the AJ's activities to substantiate his claims. In addition, even if the AJ communicated his views on the merits of the case to Mr. Masood, such an act does not suggest coercion. It is standard practice for adjudicators to discuss the merits of each party's case and give their honest appraisal of a party's likelihood of success to facilitate fruitful settlement discussions and eventual settlement. There is nothing inherently coercive in an AJ undertaking steps designed to encourage parties to enter into a settlement. Finally, neither of the cases Mr. Masood cites in his initial brief to this court, <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States <span id="Page_4809"></span>Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133 (Fed. Cir. 1987), and <span class="Italic">Fassett v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 85 MSPR 677 (2000), support a finding, based on the evidence in this case, that the settlement agreement was invalid. <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136, involved a case of involuntary resignation where the alleged coercive action that improperly forced resignation was an unwarranted denial of leave. <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> did not involve a settlement of a Board appeal, nor did it involve coercion of the type alleged by Mr. Masood in this case. <span class="Italic">Fassett</span>, 85 MSPR at 680, also involved an improper threat by an agency to take a future disciplinary action that it knew or should have known could not be substantiated. <span class="Italic">Fassett</span> is inapplicable to this case because Mr. Masood does not allege that the AJ coerced him by threatening to take disciplinary action against him. The AJ obviously could not have taken such action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another judicial determination that the Board properly found no coercion by an AJ in the course of settlement negotiations is <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. DOJ</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have previously noted, "[t]hose who employ the judicial appellate process to attack a settlement through which controversy has been sent to rest bear a properly heavy burden" of proof that the agreement was improperly obtained. <span class="Italic">Asberry v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see also Sargent</span>, 229 F.3d at 1091 ("It is well-established that in order to set aside a settlement, an appellant must show that the agreement...was involuntary....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A bare allegation of coercion is not sufficient to set aside the parties' settlement agreement. Rather, Mr. Tiburzi must make a "showing of wrongful conduct necessary to shift the burden of proof on the allegation" of the attorney's and administrative judge's coercion from himself to the agency. <span class="Italic">Asberry</span>, 692 F.2d at 1381. Petitioner has made no such showing of "wrongful conduct" here. He provides only unsubstantiated allegations that his counsel and the administrative judge made certain statements to him off the record during the hearing to coerce his acceptance of the oral agreement. Those alleged statements appear to include appraisals by petitioner's counsel and the administrative judge of the merits of petitioner's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if those statements were made, they would not be sufficient to invalidate the oral agreement. Mr. Tiburzi had to choose at the hearing between unpleasant alternatives: resigning from the agency under the terms of the oral agreement, or facing the (likely) rejection of his Board appeal and the resulting removal for cause from his position by the agency. We have repeatedly recognized that "an employee's dissatisfaction with the options that an agency has made available to him is not sufficient to render his decision to resign or retire involuntary." <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 111 F.3d 118, 121 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("[W]here an employee is faced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal for cause, such limited choices do not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act."). That principle is applicable here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As an example of what will not constitute extrajudicial conduct that would disqualify an AJ (or render invalid a settlement reached through the efforts of the AJ), consider <span class="Italic">Ali v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 563, 568-70 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has...recognized that a settlement agreement that is coerced by the administrative judge or is a product of his bias may be set aside where such a showing of coercion or bias is made. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. United States Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 274, 279 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 48 MSPR at 279-80, the Board noted that it used either the "coercion" or "bias" model to analyze allegations of administrative judge misconduct, and found that the nature of the allegations determined the selection of the model used. Even though the appellant asserts that he was forced into the agreement, we find that the bias model applies to this case since, as we discuss above, the appellant has alleged that the administrative judge stated at the May 26, 1989 telephonic conference that "based on the evidence...he was inclined to go along with the Agency." It is well settled, of course, that a party alleging such bias or prejudice must make a substantial showing of personal bias to overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity on the part of the administrative judge.... To be disqualifying, the moving party must show that the administrative judge's bias constitutes extrajudicial conduct rather than conduct that arose in the administrative proceedings before him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 48 MSPR at 279-280 (citing <span class="Italic">In Re Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc.</span>, 861 F.2d 1307, 1314 (2d Cir. 1988) (what a judge learns or comes to believe in his judicial capacity is not the kind of matter that results in disqualification), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1102 (1989)). Moreover, the party asserting bias must preserve for the record his objection to the administrative judge's conduct by timely filing, in good faith, an affidavit with the regional office sufficient to demonstrate personal bias or other disqualification. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 48 MSPR at 281-82.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, even if we consider the appellant to have timely raised an assertion of bias, we find that his affidavit fails to make the requisite showing under our decision in <span class="Italic">Lee</span> because the bias was not extrajudicial. Moreover, there is no showing that the administrative judge had prejudged the case. The administrative judge's comment to the appellant that he, the administrative judge, was "inclined to go along with the agency" was based on the evidence in the proceedings before him, as the appellant acknowledges, and on the parties' stipulations. The comment was made in the role of the administrative judge assigned to the appeal. It constituted simply his honest appraisal of the appellant's likelihood of success if he elected to pursue adjudication of his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cranfield v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 44 MSPR 384, 388 (1990) (the administrative judge's comments to the parties reflecting the weaknesses of their cases did not reflect any prejudgment or preconceived notions as to the appeal). We find that this comment by the administrative judge, as well as his other comments, were appropriate in encouraging settlement under the circumstances of this case, and that they did not show bias or prejudice....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Frank questions to and discussions with an AJ in settlement negotiations that elicited information not relied on in the initial decision did not constitute adjudicatory error, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. USPS,</span> DA-0752-10-0348-I-1 (NP 7/12/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has specifically granted its administrative judges the authority to initiate informal settlement discussions at any time during the appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(1). Further, where the parties agree to allow the administrative judge to participate in settlement discussions, a party, absent specific improper actions by the administrative judge, cannot later assert that the administrative judge's involvement in the settlement process was unwarranted. <span class="Italic">Cf. Biberstine v. Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 248, 259 (1988). Here, the appellant voluntarily disclosed that he had entered treatment for substance abuse, and we would find nothing improper about the administrative judge's request for additional information that might facilitate settlement of the appeal. Even if the administrative judge erred by questioning the appellant, the discussions took place off-the-record, and the administrative judge did not reference the appellant's refusal to answer in the initial decision. The administrative judge's error, if any, would have been harmless. <span class="Italic">See Karapinka v. Department of Energy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 124, 127 (1981).</p>

Under <span class="Italic">Forston</span>, "[a]n administrative judge is permitted to inform the parties of relevant case law and, generally, of the relative strengths and weaknesses of their positions on the issues, as he perceives them; such statements alone do not indicate that an administrative judge is biased." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chakravorty v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that the administrative judge coerced her into accepting the agency's settlement offer. To prove this allegation, the appellant must present evidence that she involuntarily accepted the other party's terms, that circumstances permitted no other alternative, and that the circumstances resulted from the administrative judge's coercive acts<span class="Italic">. See Anderson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 81 MSPR 618, 620 (1999). The appellant alleges that the administrative judge committed several coercive acts, which included statements that indicated that the appellant would lose or that he was inclined to find in favor of the agency. However, the appellant candidly admitted that the administrative judge "did listen closely to some points I made," and "became interested when I informed him of the disparate treatment of me in comparison with another agent regarding a significant gun safety issue." In light of these admissions, it does not appear that the appellant was justified in believing that the administrative judge would not have provided her with a full and fair hearing if she did not agree to settle her appeal. Furthermore, an administrative judge's honest appraisal of the appellant's case in the course of settlement discussions between the parties is not indicative of coercion<span class="Italic">. See Bell v. Department of the Army</span>, 78 MSPR 685, 689 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is nothing improper in the AJ encouraging the appellant to enter into a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Love v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 490, 493 n.2 (1993).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 691, 695-96 (1991), discerned no evidence of an AJ's coercion or bias:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as evidence that she involuntarily accepted the terms of the agreement, the appellant argues only that "the administrative judge had made a prior determination against appellant before hearing her case, thus coercing settlement."... This evidence amounts to a bare allegation by the appellant, without any basis or support in the record. We note that both the appellant and her representative signed the agreement, and that the agreement contained an opening statement, indicating that the parties entered the settlement "willingly," because they found it "to be mutually agreeable and beneficial."... The appellant has also not established that the circumstances permitted no other alternative to her. She had other options available to her, but she chose instead to settle. Finally, given her scant evidence, the appellant has not shown that her decision to reach an agreement resulted from the administrative judge's coercive acts. She has not pointed to any evidence in the record, or submitted an affidavit or any other evidence, to support her unsworn statements concerning the administrative judge's actions. Thus, we find that the appellant has failed to sustain her burden of showing coercion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that her argument can be interpreted as an allegation of bias, we find that the appellant has likewise failed to make the requisite showing.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board went on, however, to caution in <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span>, 37 MSPR at 256:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A party claiming bias or prejudgment on the part of an administrative judge, however, must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity accompanying administrative adjudicators....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's failure to raise concerns of prejudgment or coercion until almost 2 months after the execution of the settlement agreement...detracts from the credibility and plausibility of his argument that he was "forced" into settling at the time he signed the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Lang v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 35 MSPR 314 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Biberstine</span> determined that a settlement resulting from a marathon negotiating session (12 hours of meetings, recesses) was not coerced. Also rejected as indicia of coercion of settlement by the AJ in <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span> were witness rulings, granting of a continuance, and involvement of the AJ in the settlement process. <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span> resolved that an allegation that the appellant was "worked on" by his own representative to sign a settlement does not invalidate the agreement. In the Board's words in <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span>, "coercion by one's own representative may not permit a settlement, which is not unfair, to be overturned." [Refer later to "<a href="0100-2023-23-046.html#sec16-47">Coercion by Counsel or Union Representative; Lack of Signature by Counsel</a>."] Finally, <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span> concluded that preliminary rulings on witnesses, the admission of evidence, and disputed legal issues were lacking in coercive effect. Preliminary rulings are appropriate. A party who disagrees with the ruling may preserve the disagreement on the record at the hearing or by written submission if no hearing is held. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 546, 555 &#x00B6; 15 (2000) (denial of oral motion for continuance was not evidence of coercion of settlement when basis for denial may have been that it was not in proper written form); <span class="Italic">May v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 217, 217-18 (1990) (settlement was not coerced because of appellant's concerns about whether Board had jurisdiction; AJ stated that Board had jurisdiction during a telephone settlement conference; that statement was made prior to AJ's consent to accept settlement into record).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cranfield v. TVA</span>, 44 MSPR 384, 388 (1990), citing <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span>, implied that, unless there is an objection from appellant or counsel, lengthy negotiations do not demonstrate coercion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's allegations as to the administrative judge's conduct, even if true, do not show coercion on his part. In his pretrial order summarizing the pretrial/settlement conference, the administrative judge stated that he had asked the appellant's representative to drop the motion to compel because "it had been rendered moot by subsequent developments and because it concerned so many irrelevant and now undisputed matters." The administrative judge further stated that, even though he was prepared to find Board jurisdiction on the facts as represented by the parties, he could see no basis for finding Board jurisdiction over the appellant's discrimination claim regarding the agency's failure to rehire and that, even if she prevailed in her appeal as to the agency RIF action, she would be required to give up her severance pay as an offset to her back pay award. The appellant does not argue that these statements constituted misinformation. Further, we note that, in cautioning the appellant as to the status of her discovery requests and the scope of the relief she was likely to obtain, the administrative judge evenhandedly pointed out the weaknesses of each party's case. His statements do not reflect any prejudgment or preconceived notions as to the appeal, but were an attempt to make the parties aware of the likelihood of success if they elected to pursue adjudication. That the administrative judge gave the appellant the impression that he did not want to conduct a hearing cannot be deemed to be sufficient to negate her withdrawal since his comments to the parties also indicated that it was likely that he would find the facts to establish Board jurisdiction, thus entitling the appellant to a hearing. We further find that the length of the settlement discussions and the involvement of the administrative judge in them, including his participation in the appellant's consultations with her attorneys, do not establish coercion, where neither the appellant nor her attorneys objected to them. We therefore conclude that the administrative judge did not exceed his authority as an adjudicator, given the public policy encouraging settlements. <span class="Italic">See McCullough,</span> 40 MSPR at 479; <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. Department of Defense,</span> 37 MSPR 248, 259-60 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Biberstine</span> was the subject of additional commentary, <span class="Italic">Koury v. SBA</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 177-79 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges misconduct by the administrative judge which she asserts resulted in an atmosphere of pressure to arrive at a settlement.... [s]he alleges that the parties had unsuccessfully attempted a settlement prior to the hearing. She points out that the settlement was reached at approximately 4:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on Christmas Eve...that she was tired and upset, that she was far from home, and that she was in unfamiliar surroundings and in an intimidating atmosphere. She asserts that she had concerns about the agreement but was intimidated by the administrative judge's attitude when she attempted to raise her concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4811"></span>Coercion or prejudgment by an administrative judge is one of the factors which would render a settlement agreement invalid. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span>, 37 MSPR at 256. However, a party alleging bias or prejudice by an administrative judge must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity accompanying administrative adjudicators....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish that a settlement agreement was obtained through coercion, a party must prove that: (1) One side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) the circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) the circumstances were the result of the coercive acts of the opposite party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Candelaria v. United States Postal Service</span>, 31 MSPR 412, 413 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's allegations do not establish coercion. It is not uncommon for the parties to an appeal to suffer failures at settlement before achieving success.... If we were to accept the appellant's argument, we would establish a precedent that the Board's administrative judges should not participate in hearings or settlement discussions in days preceding official holidays because of an inherent coercive effect....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges...that she was tired and upset at the hearing. However, neither the appellant nor her attorney indicated at the hearing that she was unable to participate because of her physical or emotional condition. In fact, in response to the administrative judge's inquiry as to the effects of medication the appellant was taking, the appellant's attorney assured that administrative judge that they did not affect her judgment or ability to understand events....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the appellant's assertion that she was far from home and in unfamiliar surroundings does not establish coercion inasmuch as this argument could be applied to the majority of appellants who appear at hearings at one of the Board's fixed hearing sites.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant contends that when she attempted to raise concerns about the agreement she was intimidated by the administrative judge, the record shows otherwise. When the parties first claimed to have reached an agreement, the administrative judge asked the appellant if she understood the agreement, and the appellant stated she did not. The administrative judge then determined the basis for her misunderstanding and afforded the parties an opportunity to resolve their differences in an off-the-record conference. As a result, the agreement's provisions relating to the expungement of records and the appropriate agency responses to future employment inquiries were modified to address the appellant's concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant raised another question about the likelihood of her prevailing on her claim for certain per diem payments. The agency's representative informed her that the agency would support her claim for these payments. The administrative judge told her that the claim was outside the terms of the agreement. The appellant raised no further objection on this matter. Thus, the record does not support the appellant's contention that the administrative judge prevented her from raising concerns or that he was uncooperative in responding to these concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant stated at the hearing that she felt coerced. In her petition for review, she alleges that the administrative judge acted improperly by raising his voice.... However, the fact that the appellant felt coerced because the administrative judge raised his voice does not, in and of itself, establish coercion under <span class="Italic">Candelaria</span> [<span class="Italic">post</span>]. The issue is whether the appellant freely entered into the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the administrative judge took great pains to ensure that the appellant was actually consenting of her own free will to the settlement. Since the appellant said on the one hand that she agreed to the settlement but that on the other she felt "somewhat coerced," the administrative judge properly tried to determine which position represented the truth. The administrative judge ascertained that the appellant's attorney understood the legal consequences of a coerced settlement and went off the record so that the appellant and her attorney could discuss the matter. When the hearing resumed, the appellant's attorney assured the administrative judge that the appellant's use of the word "coercion" was unintentional and that she was freely entering the agreement. The appellant agreed that she was consenting to the agreement of her own free will.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Busen v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 37, 44 (1991), helpfully added that "[w]hile an overbearing manner [by the AJ] such as the parties have described is not to be condoned, we find that it does not, in and of itself, establish coercion." <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 685, 688 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) ("[t]here is nothing improper in an administrative judge encouraging the parties to enter into a settlement"; the appellant did not establish that the AJ was biased).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">McCullough v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 476, 479-80 (1989), otherwise valid rulings by the AJ on the scope and timing of the hearing and settlement negotiations (lasting four hours) did not demonstrate coercion; that the appellant could not read or understand the agreement when it was made because of medication he was taking did not invalidate the agreement. The appellant did not make that assertion to the AJ before he agreed to the settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Koury v. SBA</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 178 (1989), <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. DODDS</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 256 (1988), and <span class="Italic">McCullough v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 476, 480 (1989), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, addressed the timing of settlement discussions as an element of coercion. In <span class="Italic">McCullough</span>, the Board found unobjectionable four hours of negotiations: "[t]he length of settlement negotiations...does not, in and of itself, establish coercion." Often settlements are negotiated when a hearing begins, or in the late hours of an afternoon or early evening of a hearing. Time drags on and tensions mount, yet the anxiety produced through the process does not ordinarily invalidate the result, <span class="Italic">Schultze v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 250, 257 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further alleges that she felt coerced on December 29, 1992, because the hearing in this case was scheduled for the following day. Agreements made or decisions reached on the day of a hearing or the day before a hearing are not inherently coercive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Koury v. Small Business Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 178 (1989) (no inherent coercion in conducting a hearing late into the day before a holiday), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 298 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table); <span class="Italic">McCullough</span>, 40 MSPR at 478-80 (four hours of settlement negotiations on the day of the hearing did not indicate coercion). If it were otherwise, hearings would need to be postponed every time parties entered into negotiations so as to avoid any taint of coercion should the parties withdraw their appeals based on eve-of-the-hearing settlements....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although coercion by an AJ is a factor that would invalidate a settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">McCullough v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 476, 479 (1989), and <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 373, 376 (1990), the Board is not likely to find coercion. The Board does not lightly accept allegations that a AJ forced an appellant to accept a settlement, although it will carefully review the record. The Board expects an appellant who has been coerced by the AJ to object on the record when the appeal is still before the regional office. The appellant is not supposed to wait until after the adjudication is complete to object for the first time. <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 274, 279 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 691, 693 (1991) (on objection to settlement: "[s]he cannot wait until after the adjudication is complete to object for the first time"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Frizzell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 413, 416 (1992) (rejecting allegation of coercion resulting from personal circumstances at time of settlement, when those circumstances were first raised in PFR).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ's good faith and honesty of purpose is presumed. The appellant will need to prove that he involuntarily accepted the terms of another, that circumstances permitted no alternative, and that the circumstances were the result of the coercive tactics of another party. <span class="Italic">Candelaria v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 412, 413 (1986) ("[i]n alleging misconduct by a presiding official, an appellant must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators."). The AJ may make statements to the parties regarding his honest appraisal of the likelihood of success if they elect to pursue adjudication of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Betterly v. VA</span>, 47 MSPR 63, 65-66 (1991). An appellant's suggestion of coercion by an AJ is undermined by her representation by counsel when she entered the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Soto v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3340) (coercion by an AJ was not established when appellant was represented by counsel and agreement, signed by appellant, recited "appellant acknowledges an understanding of the provisions of this Agreement and voluntarily enters into this Agreement."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 546, 556 &#x00B6; 16 (2000) ("[I]t appears that the administrative judge provided the appellant the opportunity to consult with her father for support and advice prior to the appellant's final decision to accept the agreement.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Delacruz v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 424, 427-28 (1991), under the "honest appraisal" rubric, the Board saw no reason to set aside a settlement that the appellant complained was obtained after the AJ allegedly said that "an 'unpublished Federal Court decision' might result in the reversal of her initial decision." Unmentioned by the Board was the fact that unpublished Federal Circuit decisions are nonprecedential and should then have had no effect on the issuance of an initial decision. What the Board did mention was that the appellant did not demonstrate that his only alternative was to settle. Rather, "he could have sought to persuade the administrative judge that he should prevail on the appeal." The "just say no" approach toward the AJ who appears to be a settlement zealot was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Melvin v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 125, 129-31 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-14 (2000). The appellant filed an enforcement petition to secure back pay. That petition led to a settlement, and in turn the settlement led to another enforcement petition, and another settlement, and another enforcement petition. When the final settlement was unsuccessful, the appellant filed a PFR from the initial decision dismissing the enforcement petition as settled, and the appellant filed yet another enforcement petition. In his PFR, the appellant contended that the AJ forced him into the settlement by judicial expressions of anger and frustration when the appellant objected to entering into yet another compliance settlement with an agency that seemed determined not to properly pay him. The Board admonished the agency for its delay, but cautioned the appellant to avoid further disadvantageous settlements and to instead insist upon speedy adjudication of his claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant claimed that the administrative judge appeared frustrated and angry when the appellant balked at signing another settlement agreement that the agency proposed more than 6 months beyond the <span id="Page_4812"></span>date on which payment was due pursuant to the administrative judge's original order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Yet, the appellant could have refused to sign the last settlement agreement and insisted on a ruling by the administrative judge concerning the agency's compliance and the validity of the prior settlement agreement. Furthermore, other than the appellant's unsworn and uncorroborated allegations regarding the administrative judge's expressed displeasure, the appellant did not present evidence to show that the administrative judge engaged in coercive acts....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although "public policy favors settlement agreements, which serve to avoid unnecessary litigation and to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues," <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 MSPR 236 &#x00B6; 3 (1999), the settlement agreements in this case, in retrospect, have delayed rather than expedited the agency's payment of the back pay the appellant was due under the Board's final order. In light of this fact, the appellant is reminded that he need not enter into any settlement agreement that he does not believe adequately protects his interests and that does not settle the matter to his satisfaction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We add that with all the arguments concerning AJs' settlement coercion, some appellants believe that AJs do not do enough to obtain a settlement. The Board finds that the failure of a AJ to follow his own or Board guidance concerning settlement procedures does not constitute adjudicative error without a showing of prejudice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shafer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 164, 167 n.2 (1990). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-157.html#sec3-157">Procedure; Documenting Record; Sworn Statement</a>" concerning allegations that AJs have coerced settlements and displayed bias during adjudications.]</p>
