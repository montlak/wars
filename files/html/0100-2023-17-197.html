<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-195"><span class="space">d.</span> Procedural Violations and Remedy</h5>
<p class="noindent">Procedural violations are brought before arbitrators in promotion cases. If <span id="page_2041"></span>the procedural violation stems from interpretation of a contract clause, FLRA may resort to its negotiability case law to ascertain whether the resulting award is invalid. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, SUPSHIP Newport News and NAGE Local R4-2</span>, 57 FLRA 36, 39 (2001) (in context of exceptions to award, reviewing contract provision precluding rating criteria from being tailored to fit certain employees or applicants); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Louisville Dist. and NTEU</span>, 36 FLRA 375, 382 (1990) (sustaining award that enforced requirement that management concurrently compare qualifications of unit employees and outside candidates). Other constraints concerning promotion procedures and remedies were in the now-retired Federal Personnel Manual and in the limitations imposed, directly and indirectly, by the Back Pay Act. Cases may involve application and interpretation of procedural controls on the promotional process. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-204.html#sec9-204">Priority Consideration</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU Chap. 273</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-27.html">65 FLRA 102</a> (2010), eliminated Prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis, meaning that arbitrators may directly interpret and apply contract arrangements clauses to fashion remedies while attempting to reconstruct what management would have done in the absence of the contract violation, and <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-28.html">65 FLRA 113</a> (2010), found FLRA switching back to an "abrogation" standard when considering arguments that awards enforce arrangement clauses that violate management rights, meaning that some of the preexisting law relating to remedies became obsolete. Changes in FLRA membership resulted in another switchback, when the law returned to application to arbitration award review of the "excessive interference" standard for negotiability cases in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under law postdating <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> and <span class="Italic">EPA,</span> FLRA considered appropriate an award in a nonselection case that the agency promote the grievant to the next supervisory paralegal position that became available after the grievant was improperly denied an interview and fair consideration for a vacancy for that position, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3506</span>, 65 FLRA 405, 408-10 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing exceptions alleging that awards are contrary to law because they are inconsistent with management rights.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102 (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>). Under the revised analysis, the Authority will first assess whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted management right. <span class="Italic">EPA, </span>65 FLRA at 115. If so, then, as relevant here, the Authority examines whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Also under the revised analysis, in determining whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority assesses: (1) whether the contract provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) if so, then whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement abrogates the exercise of the management right. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 118. In concluding that the Authority would apply an abrogation standard, the Authority rejected continued application of an excessive-interference standard. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 113. In addition, in setting forth the revised analysis, the Authority rejected the continued application of the "reconstruction" requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP. FDIC, S.F. Region, </span>65 FLRA at 106-07; <span class="Italic">accord FDIC, </span>65 FLRA 179, 181 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not disputed that the award affects management's right to select. The Agency contends that Article 3, Section 2 is not an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) because it does not constitute an arrangement. As interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, Article 3, Section 2 requires that management treat all employees fairly and equitably in exercising its right to make selections for promotion. To constitute an arrangement, Article 3, Section 2 must ameliorate or mitigate adverse effects that flow from management's exercise of its management rights. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Bd. of Veterans Appeals, </span>61 FLRA 422, 425 (2005). The Authority has repeatedly found provisions requiring management to exercise its management rights fairly and equitably to constitute arrangements because they are intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the unfair or inequitable exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1367, </span>64 FLRA 869 876 (2010) (Member Beck dissenting as to other matters). Article 3, Section 2 ameliorates or mitigates the adverse effects on employees of all aspects of personnel management by ensuring that the Agency treats them fairly and equitably, without regard to various considerations, such as race, and with regard to their privacy and constitutional rights. For the foregoing reasons, we find that Article 3, Section 2 is an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency's statement that the award "abrogate[s]" management's rights constitutes a claim that Article 3, Section 2 is not an appropriate arrangement, Exceptions at 9, the Authority has previously described an award that abrogates the exercise of a management right as an award that "precludes an agency from exercising" the right. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Transp. Ctr., Fort Eustis, Va., </span>38 FLRA 186, 190 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Ft. Eustis</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., </span>37 FLRA 309, 314 (1990)). The Arbitrator enforced Article 3, Section 2 to restrict management from interviewing all of the candidates except the grievant because, according to the Arbitrator, doing so deprived her of fair and equitable treatment. As interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, Article 3, Section 2 does not preclude the Agency from exercising any of its rights; it merely requires the Agency to exercise them in a fair and equitable manner. Consequently, the Agency does not establish that the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 3, Section 2 abrogates the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See Ft. Eustis, </span>38 FLRA at 190. For the foregoing reasons, we find that Article 3, Section 2 was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that, if the Authority finds that Article 3, Section 2 constitutes a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), then the award is deficient under <span class="Italic">BEP </span>because the Arbitrator's remedy does reconstruct what management would have done had it complied with Article 3, Section 2. However, as noted above, the Authority no longer requires that an arbitrator's remedy reconstruct what management would have done had it not violated the contract provision. <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 65 FLRA at 181. Thus, the Agency's argument does not provide a basis for setting aside the award. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, as discussed above, the Arbitrator also concluded that the failure to interview the grievant constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of Article 18, Section 1. The Agency does not argue that the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 18, Section 1 affects management rights or is otherwise deficient. The Arbitrator's relief is Article 18, Section 1, as well as the harm of the violation of Article 3, Section 2. As the Agency does not assert that Article 18, Section 1 is unenforceable, the Arbitrator's reliance on that contract provision further supports the remedy.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;For the reasons set forth in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region, </span>65 FLRA at 112, Chairman Pope agrees that the Agency provides no basis for finding the Arbitrator's remedy deficient as it pertains to the violation of Article 3, Section 2 because the remedy is reasonably related to Article 3, Section 2 and the harm being remedied. Chairman Pope agrees, in addition, that the uncontested violation of Article 18, Section 1, provides an additional basis for the remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award directing promotion was affirmed, and exceptions asserting infringement of management rights were denied, in <span class="Italic">SSA, ODAR and AFGE Local 3506</span>, 67 FLRA 597, 601-04 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting), when the grievant was on the best qualified list of three competitors, two selections were made, one of the selectees was later disqualified, and management refused to then promote the grievant following the union's protest concerning procedural provisions of the contract regarding the integrity of the selection process and qualifications of competitors. FLRA's majority determined that it was the agency's burden to make plain to the arbitrator the agency's contentions not only that the union's remedy violated management rights, but also that the contract clause relied on by the union did not fall within one of the negotiability exceptions (arrangements and procedures) to its management rights:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to management's right to select a candidate under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, the award conflicts with management's right to select a candidate under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. Although the Agency "concedes that [certain] <span class="Italic">procedural</span> violations occurred," it claims that the Arbitrator erred in finding that, as a result of these violations, the Agency "forfeited its 'unfettered right'" to select. In this regard, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator cited "no authority for his premise that a <span class="Italic">procedural</span> violation of the [agreement] revokes the Agency's right to select candidates best qualified for a position, or, conversely, to refuse to select candidates not well[ ]suited for a position." The Agency concedes that, under Authority precedent, the Authority will not find an arbitration award contrary to management rights "[a]bsent a claim that an award enforces a contract provision that was not negotiated under [&#x00A7;] 7106(b)." In this regard, the Agency sets forth the Authority's existing test for determining whether arbitrators have enforced appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Further, the Agency notes that, in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2505</span> (<span class="Italic">Local 2505</span>),[69] the Authority "affirmed [an] arbitrator's decision to issue no award to [a] grievant even though the [a]gency admittedly violated" the agreement at issue there.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[69]&#x2003;64 FLRA 689 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a party alleges that an arbitrator's award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted right.[71] If the award affects the right, then the Authority examines, as relevant here, whether the award provides a remedy for a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b).[72] In conducting this examination, the Authority relies on the excepting party's claims to frame the issue that the Authority must decide. Under the Authority's case law, an award enforcing a contract provision will not be found deficient absent a claim that the contract provision was not negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.[73] And, as the Authority <span id="page_2042"></span>stated in <span class="Italic">FDIC, Division of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Protection, San Francisco Region</span> (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>),[74] an arbitrator should apply a provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) "in a way reasonably related to the provision and the harm being remedied."[75]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority places the burden on the party arguing that the award is contrary to management rights to allege not only that the award affects a right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), but also that the agreement provision that the arbitrator has enforced is not the type of contract provision that falls within &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.[76] This practice is consistent with the plain wording of, and the policies underlying, the Statute. As an initial matter, it is well established that an arbitrator's award is not contrary to law merely because the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute.[77] In this regard, under the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7106, the management rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a) are expressly "[s]ubject to" the provisions set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.[78] Therefore, an arbitrator's award that enforces a contract provision that falls within one of the subsections of &#x00A7; 7106(b) cannot be contrary to law on management-rights grounds, even if the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)[79] (unless the remedy is not reasonably related to the contract provision or the harm being remedied,[80] as discussed below).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Statute is silent regarding which party has the burden of alleging that an arbitrator has enforced a contract provision that falls within one of the subsections of &#x00A7; 7106(b). But, for two reasons, important policies underlying the Statute support placing this burden on the party that is arguing that the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, Congress intended that the arbitration process be final, and that the Authority engage in only limited review of arbitration awards. In this connection, pertinent legislative history provides that "the Authority [is] authorized to review the award of the arbitrator on <span class="Italic">very narrow grounds</span>."[81] As a result, the Authority has long held that Congress "provid[ed] that the scope of review of arbitration awards would be very narrow,"[82] and intended to promote the "primacy and finality" of the arbitration process "by <span class="Italic">limited</span>, expeditious review by the Authority."[83] Of particular relevance in the context of management rights, the Authority has stated that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the Statute's provision for final and binding arbitration and its purpose of facilitating the resolution of disputes...are best served by assuring that the decision of an arbitrator, selected by both parties to interpret and apply their collective[-]bargaining agreement, will not be overridden on management[-]rights grounds in order to relieve one party from the unwelcome result of that purposeful choice.[84]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">These policies support placing the burden on excepting parties to allege that arbitrators' awards are deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, Congress intended to foster contractual stability and repose. In this regard, courts and the Authority have held that the Statute embodies policies of "promoting collective bargaining and the negotiation of collective[-]bargaining agreements," and "enabling parties to rely on the agreements that they reach, once they have reached them."[85] Consistent with these policies, the Authority has stated that "Congress fully expected arbitrators to enforce the collective[-]bargaining agreements of [f]ederal[-]sector parties."[86] These policies support placing the burden on excepting parties to allege that, as interpreted and applied by arbitrators, their collective-bargaining agreements are unenforceable.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we reaffirm that, in order to demonstrate that an arbitrator's award is deficient on management-rights grounds, an excepting party must, as a threshold matter, allege both that the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), and that the disputed contract provision--as interpreted and applied by the arbitrator--does not fall within one of the subsections of &#x00A7; 7106(b). And while this approach is perhaps not as old as England's Exchequer Court of Pleas, it certainly is not being adopted "abruptly" here,[87] as evidenced by the Authority's repeated application of it in previous cases[88] and the Agency's express acknowledgment of its existence.</p>

Div</span>., 66 FLRA 235, 242 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Agency sets forth the Authority's existing test for determining whether an arbitrator has enforced an "appropriate arrangement" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). But &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is not the only exception to management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a). There are also exceptions in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), and, as particularly relevant here, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). In the latter regard, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute allows for the enforcement of "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under" &#x00A7; 7106. Here, the Arbitrator repeatedly found that the contract provisions he enforced were "procedural,"[92] which we interpret as findings that the provisions are procedures within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. Indeed, the Agency itself repeatedly characterizes those provisions as "procedural." Yet the Agency does not allege that those provisions, as interpreted and enforced by the Arbitrator, are not "procedures" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). Because the Agency does not allege that the provisions are not procedures within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), the Agency's attempt to demonstrate that the provisions are unenforceable on management-rights grounds fails.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent argues that we place the Agency in a "proverbial catch-22" situation because we uphold the award based on the Arbitrator's enforcement of a procedural provision that is contained only in an expired agreement. In so doing, the dissent repeats an Agency argument. But that is all it is: an <span class="Italic">argument</span>. And the argument lacks evidentiary support. In this connection, as the Union notes, the Agency has not provided us with what it contends is the current, applicable contractual wording. Unlike the dissent, we are unwilling to treat an unsupported argument (by an agency or a union) as proving a fact. Moreover, the Agency's complaint about alleged reliance on an expired agreement is confined to one arbitral finding--that the selecting official improperly discussed the grievant's qualifications with the grievant's supervisor. But the Arbitrator found that several other Agency violations occurred during the selection process, and the Agency expressly "concedes that procedural violations occurred" including: (1) the selections were not made from properly ranked and certified candidates, and (2) the Agency did not ensure that all applicants met minimum qualifications. Thus, the Agency's unsupported claim, on which the dissent so heavily relies, provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency is separately claiming that the Arbitrator's chosen <span class="Italic">remedy</span> is contrary to management's right to select, we find the Agency's claim unpersuasive. In <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>,[100] and as mentioned previously, the Authority held that "if an agency agrees to include in its collective[-] bargaining agreement a provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b), and that provision is applied by an arbitrator in a way reasonably related to the provision and the harm being remedied, a subsequent challenge to such an award is likely to be rejected by the Authority."[101]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[101]<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 107.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 26, Sections 10.A., 10.B., and 10.E., and that, but for the violations of those procedural provisions, the grievant would have been promoted. Given this finding, and that the award, the provisions, and the harm the grievant suffered <span id="page_2043"></span>all involve promotion issues, we find that the Arbitrator's remedy of retroactive promotion is reasonably related to the violated contract provisions and the harm being remedied. Thus, consistent with FDIC, we find that the Arbitrator's remedy is not deficient on management-rights grounds.[103]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[103]<span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Tank-Automotive Command</span>, 67 FLRA 14, 16-17 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Army Tank</span>) (finding that a remedy was not contrary to management rights without analyzing whether the remedy was reasonably related to the contract provision violated and the harm being remedied). To the extent that <span class="Italic">Army Tank</span> implies that the "reasonably related" standard is not an appropriate standard to apply to resolve management-rights challenges to an arbitral remedy, it will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">For the reasons set forth in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">FDIC, see</span> 65 FLRA at 112, Chairman Pope fully agrees with how the "reasonable relation" standard is applied in this case, and she would apply that standard in all cases where an arbitral remedy is challenged on management-rights grounds. In addition, Chairman Pope notes that, in <span class="Italic">Army Tank</span>, she agreed with the pertinent analysis solely to avoid an impasse in the resolution of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 67 FLRA at 17 n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making this finding, we note the Agency's claim that it has the right "to refuse to select candidates not well[ ]suited for a position," as well as the dissent's characterization of the grievant's qualifications as "subpar." To the extent that the Agency and the dissent are challenging the Arbitrator's express finding that the grievant was qualified for the position and that, but for the violations of the negotiated procedures, the Agency would have selected the grievant for the position, there is no basis for adopting the Agency's and the dissent's position here. In this regard, the Agency has not filed nonfact exceptions to these arbitral findings, and, as discussed previously, in applying <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review to an arbitrator's legal conclusions, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings, unless the excepting party demonstrates that those findings are nonfacts.[108] Thus, as the Agency has not excepted to these arbitral findings on nonfact grounds, we defer to those findings, and the Agency's claim provides no basis for finding the award deficient. Moreover, we note that, to support his statements regarding the grievant's qualifications, the dissent cites only unsupported Agency arguments and discredited witness testimony, not any findings in the Arbitrator's award. By so doing, the dissent ignores that the parties have jointly chosen the Arbitrator, not the Authority, to find facts.[110]</p>

<p class="noindent">The ability of an arbitrator to remedy procedural or contract irregularities in the course of promotions was addressed in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-97 and Naval Mine Eng'g Facility, Yorktown</span>, 5 FLRA 452, 455-56 (1981). The grievant was initially certified under the vacancy announcement to be the only individual meeting the criteria for highly qualified status. The agency issued another selection certificate, increasing the number of highly qualified candidates, when it determined that the vacancy announcement was written too restrictively. When he was not selected, the initially certified employee grieved. The arbitrator awarded the position to the grievant, citing the procedural irregularities. In its exceptions the agency argued that denial of consideration for promotion was not an adequate basis to award a promotion, and FLRA agreed, while endorsing a remedy of priority consideration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Requirement 4 of subchapter 1-4 FPM chapter 335, provides that all selection procedures established by an agency in promotion actions must provide for management's right to select or not select from among a group of candidates. This retained right of management to select or not select may however be abridged if a direct connection is found between improper agency action and the agency's failure to select a specific employee for promotion. Therefore, when a grievance involving management's actions in a particular promotion action is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator may properly direct the grievant to be selected for the position in question if the arbitrator finds a direct causal relationship between improper agency action and the agency's failure to select the grievant for promotion. More particularly, the arbitrator must find not only a violation of, for example, the parties' collective bargaining agreement or pertinent regulations, but also that had the violations not occurred management itself would definitely have originally selected the grievant for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, although the Arbitrator found that the Activity violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement, agency regulations, and the Federal Personnel Manual, he found that the consequence of these violations was that the grievant "was denied the process to which he was entitled by reason of the collective bargaining agreement and the pertinent regulations." The Arbitrator's finding that the grievant "was denied the process to which he was entitled" plainly is not the requisite finding that, but for the defective promotion process, the grievant would definitely have been selected for promotion.... [U]nder FPM chapter 335 the Activity was not obligated in the circumstances of this case to select the grievant....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However,...the Arbitrator made a specific finding that the Activity violated the parties' agreement, agency regulations, and the Federal Personnel Manual and that these violations denied the grievant the process to which he was entitled.... In such circumstances, an appropriate remedy is to direct that the grievant be given priority consideration under a new promotion or placement action....</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator decided that the agency violated the negotiated agreement by not interviewing the grievant and, had the grievant been interviewed, she might have been selected for the job. That, FLRA declared, was an insufficient finding of causal connection to support a promotion. <span class="Italic">DLA, DOD, Battle Creek and AFGE Local 1626</span>, 28 FLRA 578, 579 (1987). FLRA modified the award to grant the grievant priority consideration for the next equivalent vacancy. Priority consideration was also used in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE AFL-CIO Local 1615</span>, 30 FLRA 562, 568-69 (1987), after FLRA set aside a promotion award for lack of causal connection.

<p class="noindent">A series of procedural irregularities and suggestions of improprieties did not warrant promotion with back pay when the arbitrator did not definitively find a causal or "but for" relation in <span class="Italic">HCFA, DHHS and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 274, 283-87 (1990). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Beaumont and AFGE Council of Prisons Locals C-33</span>, 59 FLRA 466, 467 (2003) (setting aside award of back pay for promotion opportunity that grievant lost while on home duty; there was no showing of causal connection between contract violation and back pay award); <span class="Italic">SSA, OHA and AFGE Local 3627</span>, 58 FLRA 124, 125-26 (2002) (directed promotion set aside for lack of finding of causal relationship between contract violation and nonpromotion; FLRA directed priority consideration as remedy specified by contract); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Project Office, Redstone and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 56 FLRA 388, 390-91 (2000) (remanding for consideration by arbitrator of whether grievant, alleging unfair reassignment out of office, demonstrated through "but for" test that she would have been promoted had she remained in original office where another employee was noncompetitively promoted). But if the arbitrator concludes that the grievant was not fully considered, was better qualified than the selectee, and would have been selected had he been fairly considered, a promotion remedy will be sustained. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Houston and AFGE Local 1633</span>, 36 FLRA 122, 127 (1990).

<p class="noindent">If an arbitrator determines that the selection process did not conform to applicable requirements, the arbitrator may order the selection action rerun or reconstructed as a corrective action. <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania NG and ACT</span>, 35 FLRA 478, 490 (1990). Or the arbitrator may undertake the process of reconstructing the action and determine a remedy appropriate to the case, consistent with the contract and law. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Louisville Dist. and NTEU</span>, 36 FLRA 375, 387-88 (1990). If an arbitrator determines that a promotion action was improperly run and orders that it be rerun, management retains the discretion to decide not to fill the position. <span class="Italic">Adjutant Gen., Oklahoma Air Nat'l Guard and AFGE, Will Rogers Air Nat'l Guard Local 3953</span>, 8 FLRA 112, 114-15 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator may not limit the agency in filling the position to the list of best-qualified candidates and preclude the agency from filling the position from another appropriate source. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R-1-185 and Adjutant Gen. of Connecticut</span>, 25 FLRA 509, 512 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania NG and ACT</span>, 35 FLRA 478, 489 (1990) ("As previously noted, the failure to provide reasons for not selecting a unit employee does not, by itself, permit an arbitrator to order <span id="page_2044"></span>a grievant selected for a position.... Further, by directing the Agency to select from among the four original civilian technician applicants, D'Urso Award II violates the Agency's right to select from any appropriate source."). The arbitrator may not interpret or enforce a provision of the negotiated agreement that denies management the right to select from either a group of properly ranked and certified candidates or from any other appropriate source. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Houston and AFGE Local 1633</span>, 32 FLRA 997, 1001 (1988) (setting aside award deciding management breached contract by selecting employee from another medical center to fill vacancy when three qualified candidates were at site of selection); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania NG and ACT</span>, 35 FLRA 478, 489-90 (1990) (setting aside award finding procedural violations as to selection and directing agency to select one of four individuals who originally applied for position). Because an arbitrator may not substitute his judgment for that of the agency in the exercise of management rights, a remedy relating to a promotion was set aside that directed a geographic reassignment and that directed the agency to select the grievant for the position at issue. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin. and AFGE Local 2814</span>, 15 FLRA 401, 401-02 (1984). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-201.html#sec9-201">Reruns</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Tuscaloosa and AFGE Local 131,</span> 64 FLRA 379, 381 (2009), upheld an award finding a procedural violation in a promotion action and ordering that the promotion be rerun and that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> be restored, meaning the individual who was chosen for the job would be taken out of the position. Over the dissent of Member Beck as to whether the remedy ordered by the arbitrator violated contract remedial limitations, FLRA determined that the award did not violate law concerning restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 establishes that adverse actions such as removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, or furloughs for 30 or fewer days must be based on "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). The Authority has held that neither vacating a selection nor rerunning a selection action constitutes an adverse action within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 58 FLRA 739, 742 (2003). Consistent with this precedent, &#x00A7; 7513 does not apply in this case, and the Agency's reliance on it provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 addresses "[a]ctions based on unacceptable performance" and provides, in pertinent part, that "an agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303. The award does not concern unacceptable performance. Specifically, it neither directs the Agency to take any actions based on unacceptable performance nor precludes the Agency from taking such actions. Accordingly, the Agency provides no basis for finding the award contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3502 concerns the "[o]rder of retention" that applies when agencies conduct reductions-in-force (RIFs). This case does not involve a RIF, and there is no basis for finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3502 applies here. Accordingly, the Agency's reliance on that statute provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the Agency's contrary-to-law exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may award retroactive promotion and back pay under the Back Pay Act to remedy an administrative or clerical error that delayed a promotion. It is only essential that the official having the authority to approve the promotion has done so; when, subsequent to that approval, formal ministerial action to effect the promotion is not taken on a timely basis as required or intended, a retroactive promotion with back pay is authorized. <span class="Italic">AFGE, San Francisco Region and Office of Program Operations, Field Operations, SSA, San Francisco Region</span>, 7 FLRA 622, 623-24 (1982). The Back Pay Act permits an award of back pay for a promotion in delay cases only if the unwarranted delay is subsequent to approval of the promotion by a properly authorized official. If a promotion freeze intervenes, an award granting back pay will be set aside. The requisite approval for the promotion has not occurred. <span class="Italic">Army Air Defense Ctr., Ft. Bliss and NAGE Local R-14-22</span>, 10 FLRA 161, 162 (1982). If an arbitrator makes a mistake in the retroactive date for a promotion, an agency exception will be sustained, and the award will be corrected to show the proper date. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2855 and Army Military Traffic Mgmt. Command, E. Area</span>, 13 FLRA 251, 253 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator may direct, as part of his award, that management adhere to internal regulations, even if those regulations designate the level and responsibilities of officials involved in the promotion process. The arbitrator will not have interfered in the right of management to determine who will perform various functions if the arbitrator enforces a decision, recorded in an agency regulation, that has already delegated authority to certain individuals. <span class="Italic">Army Armor Ctr. and AFGE Local 2302</span>, 28 FLRA 753, 755-56 (1987). The arbitrator may enforce a contract provision that vacancies be posted, even if the agency desires to fill the position with military personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">ACT and Pennsylvania NG</span>, 29 FLRA 1318, 1319 (1987). A remedy in a promotion case is not deficient because the arbitrator warns the agency to avoid a future violation but awards no retroactive relief, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 200 and Dept. of Transp. FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 769, 770 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Union's exception can be construed as arguing that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by failing to grant any of the Union's requested remedies, the Authority has held that arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1617</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). However, an arbitrator is not required to provide a party with a remedy, even when the arbitrator finds that a contractual violation has occurred. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1904</span>, 56 FLRA 196, 200 (2000); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA, Region X, Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals</span>, 49 FLRA 691, 696 (1994). In addition, arbitrators have no obligation to grant a remedy after finding that an agency violated merit-system principles. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Army Chem. &#x0026; Military Police Ctrs., Fort McClellan, Ala.</span>, 39 FLRA 457, 464 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Fort McClellan</span>). Further, when an arbitrator advises an agency not to commit future contractual violations and thereby puts an agency on "notice...that future violations could result" in further corrective action, this "notice" constitutes a remedy, "albeit not the requested remedy[.]" <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1904</span>, 56 FLRA at 200.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an arbitrator considers an alleged procedural violation of a merit promotion plan, care is to be taken to avoid an award that infringes on management's right to determine agency organization. <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Washington Army Nat'l Guard, Tacoma and NAGE Sub-Local R12-122</span>, 45 FLRA 782, 787-88 (1992), reviewed an award that determined that management erred by posting a position as a military rather than civilian position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency determined that the vacant supervisory position would be designated and filled as a military position, not a civilian position. The Agency's decision to make the position a military position concerns the organization and functional structure of the Agency and the assignment of duties to personnel. Therefore, the Agency's decision constitutes the exercise of the Agency's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.... The Arbitrator's award directly interferes with the Agency's exercise of that right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Arbitrator's reliance on [<span class="Italic">Local R-1-185 NAGE and</span>] <span class="Italic">Adjutant General</span> [<span class="Italic">of Connecticut</span>], 25 FLRA 509, is misplaced. In that case, the agency had determined that a vacant position would be advertised as both a civilian and a military position. That situation is different from the situation in the present case in which the Agency had decided to make the position a military position open to AGRs only. For the reasons stated above, the Agency had the right to make that decision pursuant to its right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute and the Arbitrator erred by requiring the Agency to rerun the selection action and select the most qualified applicant, even if that applicant were a civilian.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's reliance on [<span class="Italic">ACT and</span>] <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania National Guard</span> [29 FLRA 1318 (1987)]. In <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania National Guard</span>, an agency failed to post the position of aircraft pneudraulic system mechanic and filled it with an AGR employee. An arbitrator found that the agency violated the collective bargaining agreement and agency regulations by failing to post the position in question. The arbitrator ordered the agency to post the position in accordance with the procedure set forth in the agreement and agency regulation. The Authority denied the agency's exceptions to the award and found that the parties' collective bargaining agreement and merit promotion plan "encompasse[d] the position in dispute" and that enforcement of the merit promotion plan "preserve[d] management's discretion to establish its organizational structure." 29 FLRA at 1320. In this case, however, the Agency did not fail to post the position in question, but rather, posted the position as a military position only, in accordance with its decision to do so. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania National Guard</span> is inconsistent with our conclusion that the award directly interferes with management's right to determine its organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not apparent that the provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement enforced by the Arbitrator in his award constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to determine its organization. Article XVI, Section 1 of the agreement provides only that the merit promotion plan will apply "to the extent that the provisions of the Agreement relating to merit promotion are applicable only to employees in the bargaining unit." That provision does not address the establishment of positions as military positions or the selection of nonbargaining unit AGRs to fill military positions or any foreseeable adverse effects on employees that might result from the exercise of any of management's rights....</p>
