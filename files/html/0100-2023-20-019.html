<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-19-1"><span class="space">g.</span> Normal Duties Not Including Investigation and Disclosure of Wrongdoing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A VA transportation chief, responsible for oversight and security of the vehicle fleet and fleet cards, reported lack of secure storage of vehicle keys and fleet cards and fraudulent card use. The Board clarified the burden of proof of an individual who makes disclosures connected with his duties to distinguish responsibility for investigation and disclosure of wrongdoing from duties that require program oversight. <span class="Italic">Salazar v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 42, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-22 (2022), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge erred by applying 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) because the appellant's principal job function was not to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge applied 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) (2016) to find that the appellant's disclosures were not protected. For the reasons that follow, we find that the appellant's disclosures should have been analyzed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and not subjected to the slightly higher burden of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The enactment of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) as part of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA) clarified the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), which was in place before the WPEA, agencies generally were prohibited from engaging in reprisal for "any disclosure" that an employee reasonably believed evidenced certain categories of wrongdoing. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (2011). A Senate report accompanying the bill that was enacted as the WPEA indicated that judicial and Board interpretations of the WPA had "narrow[ed] the scope of protected disclosures" in a manner that "undermine[d] the WPA's intended meaning." S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 4-6 (2012), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 592-94. Most relevant to our discussion here, the report stated disagreement with the conclusion of the decision in <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1140-41 &#x0026; n.1, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1998), that disclosures made by a Government inspector concerning private parties' noncompliance with Federal Government approved conservation plans were not protected under the WPA because he made them as part of his regular job duties. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5-6 &#x0026; n.13. Accordingly, the WPEA added the following provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)] if [the agency takes a personnel action] with respect to that employee in reprisal for the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">WPEA, Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 101(b)(2)(C), 126 Stat. 1465, 1466 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) (2012)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In adopting this language, the Senate report stated that it was overturning prior case law, including <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, and clarifying that a whistleblower is not deprived of protection just because the disclosure was made in the normal course of an employee's duties. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5. However, the Senate report also explained that an appellant making a disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) was required to show that "actual reprisal occurred," i.e., that "the agency took the action with an improper, retaliatory motive." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the report observed that the language of section 2302(f)(2) imposed an "extra proof requirement" or "slightly higher burden" for proving the disclosure was protected. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5-6. In explaining the reason for this higher burden, the report identified the concern of "facilitat[ing] adequate supervision of employees, such as auditors and investigators, whose job is to regularly report wrongdoing":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3659"></span>Personnel actions affecting auditors, for example, would ordinarily be based on the auditor's track-record with respect to disclosure of wrongdoing; and therefore a provision forbidding any personnel action taken because of a disclosure of wrongdoing would sweep too broadly. However, it is important to preserve protection for such disclosures, for example where an auditor can show that she was retaliated against for refusing to water down a report.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 18 (2013), the Board observed that the WPA's definition of disclosure contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) was ambiguous as to whether disclosures made in the normal course of an employee's duties were protected. It found the new provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2), which was enacted as part of the WPEA, clarified this ambiguity to provide that these types of disclosures were covered under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-26. The version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) enacted as part of the WPEA was the version in place when the events in this case occurred and when the administrative judge issued his May 2016 initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (2018 NDAA) explicitly clarified the intent of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In May 2017, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs recommended passage of a bill titled the Office of Special Counsel Reauthorization Act of 2017. S. Rep. No. 115-74, at 1 (2017). The bill proposed to add language to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) providing that, "[i]f a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, <span class="Italic">the principal job function of whom is to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing</span>,...the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)] if...[the agency takes a personnel action] with respect to the disclosing employee in reprisal for the disclosure." S. Rep. No. 115-74, at 21-22 (emphasis added). In recommending this modification, the Committee stated that it "clarifies that an employee with a principal job function of investigating and disclosing wrongdoing will not be excluded from whistleblower protection laws" if he can prove that actual reprisal occurred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8; <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5 (containing the "actual reprisal" language).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An amended version of the bill passed the Senate on August 1, 2017, and was referred to the House of Representatives 3 days later, still containing the proposed change to section 2302(f)(2). An Act to Reauthorize the Office of Special Counsel, and for other purposes, S. 582, 115th Cong. &#x00A7; 4 (2017); Communication from the Clerk of the House, 163 Cong. Rec. H6587 (Aug. 4, 2017). The language of the bill, as passed by the Senate, later appeared, with relatively few changes, in the 2018 NDAA, Pub. L. No. 115-91, &#x00A7; 1097, 131 Stat. 1283, 1615-23 (2017), under the heading "Office of Special Counsel Reauthorization." In particular, the 2018 NDAA contained an amendment to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) that was identical to the version in the Senate bill, save for one non-substantive change that is not relevant to our discussion here.[2] <span class="Italic">Compare</span> Pub. L. No. 115-91, &#x00A7; 1097(c)(1)(B)(ii), 131 Stat. at 1618, <span class="Italic">with</span> S. 582, 115th Cong. &#x00A7; 4 (reflecting that the phrase "referred to" was moved from the middle to the beginning of a parenthetical). Accordingly, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) now expressly applies only to employees whose principal job functions are to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Apart from the Senate report on S. 582, discussed above, the legislative history is silent as to the purpose of the 2018 NDAA's amendment to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2). For example, although it appears that the Senate and House agreed in November 2017 to add the Senate's proposed version of section 2302(f)(2) to the 2018 NDAA, the accompanying report provides no explanation. H.R. Rep. No. 115-404, at 338-39 (2017) (Conf. Rep.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not raised by the parties, we must address whether this amended language applies to this appeal, given that the actions at issue here took place before the 2018 NDAA was enacted. We find that it does.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Given our determination that the 2018 NDAA's amendment to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) is retroactive, it is unnecessary to consider OSC's motion seeking leave to file an additional pleading about the 2018 NDAA as it relates to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper analytical framework for determining whether a new statute should be given retroactive effect was set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a case implicates a [F]ederal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">E.g., Edwards v. Department of Labor</span>, 2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6; 31 (identifying <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> as providing the proper analytical framework for determining whether a new statute should be given retroactive effect); <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 7 (same). The first step under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> is to determine if Congress expressly defined the temporal reach of the statute. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280; <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. If so, that command is controlling. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280. Here, the 2018 NDAA amending 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) is silent regarding retroactivity. Pub. L. No. 115-91, &#x00A7; 1097(c)(1)(B)(ii), 131 Stat. at 1618; <span class="Italic">see Edwards</span>, 2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29, 32 (so finding as to the 2018 NDAA's amendment of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must therefore determine whether the amended provision impairs the parties' respective rights, increases a party's liability for past conduct, or imposes new duties with respect to past transactions. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280. For the reasons that follow, we find that the 2018 NDAA's modification of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) does not have an impermissible retroactive effect under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> because it does not alter the parties' respective rights or liabilities, and does not impose new duties to past transactions when compared to the earlier version of the statute initially contemplated by Congress as part of the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When legislation clarifies existing law, its application to preenactment conduct does not raise concerns of retroactivity. <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 10. In determining whether a new law clarifies existing law, "[t]here is no bright-line test." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11 (quoting <span class="Italic">Levy v. Sterling Holding Co</span>., 544 F.3d 493, 506 (3d Cir. 2008) (citation omitted)). However, "[s]ubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 395 U.S. 367, 380-81 (1969)). Other factors relevant in determining whether a legislative enactment clarifies, rather than effects a substantive change in, existing law are the presence of ambiguity in the preceding statute and the extent to which the new law resolves the ambiguity and comports with both the prior statute and any prior administrative interpretation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, 544 F.3d at 507 (finding these factors "particularly important" for "determining whether a new regulation merely 'clarifies' existing law") (citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first of these factors, expressions of legislative intent, weighs in favor of finding that the amended language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) merely clarified its predecessor. In making this determination, we look to the legislative history of S. 582. When legislative history relates to prior drafts of a statute that did not change before passage, the Board may rely on that history in interpreting the enacted statute. <span class="Italic">See Ganski v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32, &#x00B6; 12 &#x0026; n.2 (2000) (relying on legislative history for a bill with the same language as the WPA that was pocket vetoed to interpret the enacted WPA); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Santella</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 452, 462 &#x0026; n.9 (1994) (considering the legislative history for a bill that never became law in interpreting a similar change eventually effectuated as part of the WPA). Here, the legislative history of the 2018 NDAA does not explain the purpose of the modification to the WPEA's version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2). However, S. 582 included the same clause at issue here, later enacted as part of the 2018 NDAA, limiting the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) to disclosures made during the normal course of duties of an employee whose "principal job function...is to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing." Further, the 2018 NDAA was enacted in December 2017, less than 5 months after the Senate passed S. 582 in August of the same year. Therefore, we find it appropriate to rely on the statement of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that S. 582 was intended to clarify in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) that employees whose principal job functions are to investigate and disclose wrongdoing are not excluded from whistleblower protections. S. Rep. No. 115-74, at 8. Accordingly, we conclude that the intent of Congress in adopting the relevant language at issue here was to clarify 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-33, we found that the expansion of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) to include additional protected activities did not apply retroactively. In doing so, we observed that nothing in the 2018 NDAA, S. 582, or the latter's bill report indicated that it was intended to clarify an existing law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 33 n.11. Because bill report S. Rep. No. 115-74 contains such a statement as it concerns the change to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2), we find the situation distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, and we do not apply the same analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 115-74, at 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to the question of whether the prior version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) was ambiguous and, if so, whether that ambiguity is resolved by the 2018 NDAA in a manner that comports with the prior statute and administrative interpretation. We find that the WPEA's version of section 2302(f)(2) was ambiguous regarding what types of employees that provision was meant to cover, and that the 2018 NDAA resolved that ambiguity. The administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Acha v. Department of Agriculture</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-1221-13-0197-W-2, applied the heightened <span id="Page_3660"></span>standard to a Forest Service purchasing agent. After the case was appealed, OSC filed an <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief arguing that Congress did not intend for the new heightened standard of section 2302(f)(2) to apply to a Federal employee whose core job functions did not require investigating and reporting wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief on Behalf of the United States Office of Special Counsel as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> in Support of Petitioner-Appellant and in Favor of Reversal at 10-11, <span class="Italic">Acha v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 841 F.3d 878 (10th Cir. 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the confusion over this issue, OSC requested of Congress a clarifying amendment, which was then included in the OSC reauthorization bill along with other legislative requests from OSC. The clarifying amendment resolved this ambiguity and, as discussed above, comports with how Congress described its purposes for the original language in the WPEA. Thus, we find that the 2018 NDAA's version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) may be applied retroactively in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's principal job function was not to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning back to the facts of this appeal, the appellant made his disclosures as part of his normal duties as a Motor Vehicle Supervisor. Nonetheless, it is apparent that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2), as recently clarified in the 2018 NDAA, does not apply to him. Section 2302(f)(2) includes only employees whose principal job functions are regularly investigating and disclosing wrongdoing. The appellant's principal job functions included supervising, scheduling, and monitoring staff, and ensuring good relationships with customers.[6] Although his position description indicated that he conducted "audits as directed," this potential assignment was listed among a number of "General Administration and Operational Duties," and there is no evidence that the agency routinely requested that he conduct audits or that conducting audits was the reason his position existed. Therefore, the appellant's disclosures fall under the generally applicable 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), rather than 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We have considered the appellant's principal duties in his assigned position of Motor Vehicle Supervisor at the time he made his disclosures. Although the appellant was performing the duties of the Chief of Transportation, he was not officially assigned to this position, but rather was "fill[ing] in" as required by his position description. There is no indication that the Chief of Transportation was principally tasked with investigating and disclosing wrongdoing.</p>
