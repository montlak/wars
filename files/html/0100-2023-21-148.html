<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-146"><span class="space">3.</span> Supplemental, Redetermined Annuity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Redetermined annuities were described in <span class="Italic">Pugach v. OPM</span>, 46 F.3d 1081, 1082-83 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner retired from federal service effective May 29, 1982. From February 14, 1983 through February 13, 1985, petitioner was reemployed by the Defense Logistics Agency. From September 2, 1986 through October 21, 1989, petitioner was reemployed by the Internal Revenue Service. It is undisputed that petitioner was reemployed during these two separate periods for a total of more than 5 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner applied to OPM for a redetermined annuity under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8344. That statutory provision sets forth:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an annuitant receiving annuity from the Fund...becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, his service on and after the date he is so employed is covered by this subchapter....If the described employment of the annuitant continues for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, he may elect...to...have his rights redetermined under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. Sec. 8344(a) (1988) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's implementing regulation sets forth that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the annuitant is employed continuously for at least five years in an appointive or elective position and actually serves for at least five years on a full time basis, or the equivalent of five years of full-time service on a part-time basis, in a position not excluded from coverage...the annuitant may make a deposit...and elect instead of the supplemental annuity described herein to have his or her retirement rights redetermined under the law in effect at separation date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. Sec. 831.803(b) (1993) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the statute sets forth that an annuity can be redetermined only if the reemployment "continues for at least 5 years." To continue means "to maintain without interruption a condition, course, or action," "to remain in existence: ENDURE." Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 284 (1989). Therefore, the statute by its very terms is clear in requiring employment that continues, i.e., in which there is no break, for 5 years. Petitioner's arguments to the contrary, that Sec. 8344(a) does not require 5 years of employment without a break, are misplaced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">True v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 251, 254-55 (1990) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">True v. OPM</span>, 926 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1991)), sketched the definitions and relation of supplemental and redetermined annuities, including the interplay of periods on workers compensation, for employees who retire, work again for the federal government, and again retire:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8344(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code provides, in pertinent part, that if an annuitant becomes reemployed, his service is covered for retirement annuity purposes. This section further provides that if the annuitant serves on a full-time basis for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, his annuity on termination of employment is increased under other specified sections of Title 5, i.e., a supplemental annuity based on the reemployment service is added to the prior annuity. If the employment continues for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, the annuitant may elect to have his annuity rights redetermined with credit for all prior service. <span class="Italic">Id. See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.802(a) and (b). OPM claims that when the appellant was reemployed, he was reemployed as an annuitant under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a), regardless of his receipt of FEC benefits[3], and that only actual work is credited in determining entitlement to supplemental or redetermined annuities. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(f) bars receipt of both an annuity and FEC for the same period of time and permits the annuitant to elect to receive the greater of either benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As noted above, there is an explicit, specific requirement in section 8344(a) that the reemployed annuitant actually work one or five years, respectively, of full-time service, or its part-time equivalent, to establish entitlement to the post-retirement benefits. An employee is generally entitled to service credit for LWOP, or other periods of separation, while he is receiving compensation if the individual returns to full-time work after the cessation of FEC benefits. <span class="Italic">See Losh v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 150, 153 (1988). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(a). The appellant, however, was not an employee during his separation; rather, he was an annuitant as defined under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's status as an annuitant cannot be revoked or withdrawn in order for him to receive credit for periods of non-pay status during which he received FEC while a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">Cf. Taylor v. United States,</span> 591 F.2d 688, 690 (Ct. Cl. 1979) (employee's separation, after it becomes effective, may not thereafter be revoked or withdrawn at his option). An individual remains an annuitant even though he elects to receive FEC benefits during certain periods of time. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(9) and 8337(f). <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM Supp. 831-1, subch S3-4a and S3-4c. Thus, in sum, there is a distinction between a reemployed annuitant receiving FEC, such as the appellant, and those otherwise separated or carried on the rolls in LWOP while receiving FEC and later reemployed in the Federal service. Only actual service is creditable for the post-retirement benefit, <span id="Page_4330"></span>and the appellant is therefore not entitled to credit for the 4 hours daily of LWOP. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.802(e) and (f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the administrative judge erred in concluding that the appellant was entitled to service credit for the period he was in LWOP status and received FEC benefits. Our consideration does not end here, however, since it must be further determined whether the appellant's reemployment period qualified for a supplemental or redetermined annuity in accordance with section 8344(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To qualify for a redetermined annuity, the appellant must show that he completed at least 5 years of creditable actual reemployment service, or its part-time equivalent. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(a). This is a statutory requirement and is not subject to waiver or exception. <span class="Italic">See generally Graef v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 676, 678 (1984); <span class="Italic">Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 267, 272 (1981). The undisputed facts in this case show that the appellant had actual service while reemployed part-time for annuity purposes from December 25, 1982, to December 3, 1987, totaling 2 years, 6 months, and 18 days (unused sick leave of 156 hours). Thus, under the circumstances, OPM's decision that the appellant is entitled to a supplemental annuity rather than a redetermined annuity must be affirmed since he was employed continuously for over one year but less than five years. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.802.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kopp v. OPM</span>, 456 Fed. Appx. 896, 897-98 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), contained a brief factual recitation touching on legal distinctions between a recalculated and a supplemental annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 1, 2005, Mr. Kopp was reemployed by the FAA as a Technical Assistant, where he worked until May 2, 2008, when he retired. Upon Mr. Kopp's separation from service, the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") recalculated his annuity. In recalculating his annuity, OPM gave Mr. Kopp service credit for his period of reemployment as if he were a new hire. However, because Mr. Kopp was over 60 years old at the time of his reemployment, he should have been continued as an annuitant during his period of reemployment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(d). As an annuitant who worked more than a year but less than five years, Mr. Kopp was entitled to a supplemental annuity but not a recomputed annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 837.503, 837.504.[1] The effect of OPM's error was not only to give Mr. Kopp service credit for the period of his reemployment, but also to give him credit for the period between July 22, 1982, and May 1, 2005, when he was receiving workers' compensation benefits. Those errors resulted in an overpayment to Mr. Kopp of $50,865.83 over the period between May 3, 2008, and January 31, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although Mr. Kopp was receiving workers' compensation benefits rather than disability retirement benefits, he was still considered an OPM annuitant because if he stopped receiving workers' compensation benefits, his disability retirement annuity would be restored.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Redetermined and supplemental annuities were opaquely outlined by <span class="Italic">Wells v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 692, 693-95 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was separated from a position covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) under early optional retirement in 1988, at age 51, with 23 years of service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2). He was reemployed in the civil service for more than five years, and was separated by resignation in 1994, at age 56, with 28 total years of service. OPM denied his request to have his CSRS rights redetermined following his 1994 separation, finding instead that he could only receive a supplemental annuity for his reemployment service. Upon this timely appeal, the administrative judge affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision; the administrative judge held that the appellant was not entitled to a "redetermined annuity" because he did not meet the criteria for an immediate annuity when he was separated in 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in his timely petition for review that he meets the regulatory criteria for a "redetermined annuity." OPM opposes the petition for review. The parties have made additional submissions on review, in response to a request from the Clerk for their views on issues that were not considered below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was entitled to a supplemental annuity following his 1994 separation, based on his service as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a). An individual with five years of service as a reemployed annuitant "may elect instead of [a supplemental annuity] ,...to have his rights redetermined under [the CSRS]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM and the administrative judge found that the appellant nonetheless was not entitled to make such an election. Specifically, they found that he was not entitled to a "redetermined annuity," because he did not meet the requirements for an immediate annuity when he was separated from reemployment service in 1994; at that time he was just 56 years old with 28 years of service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(a), (b), (f) (an individual is entitled to an immediate annuity if upon separation he or she is 55 years of age and has 30 years of service, or is 60 years of age and has 20 years of service, or is 62 years of age and has 5 years of service). In response to the initial decision, the appellant contends that he has a right to have his annuity "redetermined," in the sense of "recomputed," by adding his 5 years of reemployment service to his 23 years of service that ended in 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties have framed the issue incorrectly. The question is not whether the appellant has a right to a "redetermined annuity"--a term not found in the relevant statute--but whether he may "elect...to have his <span class="Italic">rights</span> redetermined under [the CSRS]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) (emphasis supplied). The appellant plainly meets the only statutory criterion of eligibility for electing a redetermination of his retirement rights, namely, he has at least five years of service as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, the appellant meets all of the regulatory criteria of eligibility for electing a redetermination of his retirement rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 837.504(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining question is what the appellant's rights would be upon redetermination. The appellant cannot have the annuity, title to which is based on his 1988 separation with 23 years of service, recomputed to include credit for his 5 years of reemployment service that ended in 1994, because by statute an annuity must be computed using only the total service credit as of the time of the separation upon which title to the annuity is based. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(b). Conversely, the appellant is not entitled to an immediate annuity based on his 1994 separation with 28 total years of service, because, as noted above, he did not meet the age and service requirements for an immediate annuity when he was separated in 1994. If the appellant's retirement rights were redetermined based on his 1994 separation, he would be entitled to a deferred annuity, computed with 28 years of service, when he becomes 62 years of age (in 1999). Electing to have his retirement rights redetermined, that is, electing the deferred annuity based on the 1994 separation, would require the appellant to relinquish the annuity he is receiving based on the 1988 separation, since a current annuitant is not considered an "employee" eligible for a deferred annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8338(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 837.201.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, OPM's reconsideration decision and the initial decision below, which both found that the appellant's only right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) is to a supplemental annuity, are REVERSED. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a), the appellant has the right to elect, instead of an annuity supplementing his current annuity, to relinquish his present annuity rights altogether and instead to seek a deferred annuity, based on his 1994 separation, when he becomes 62 years of age. OPM's CSRS and FERS Handbook, &#x00A7; 10OA6.1-1A, requires OPM to "define the difference in benefits for an annuitant who has worked as a reemployed annuitant for 5 or more years and needs to elect" between a supplemental annuity or a redetermination of retirement rights. OPM has never advised the appellant of the difference in benefits because, up until it filed its response to the Clerk's order, it has not acknowledged that the appellant can have his rights redetermined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, OPM is ORDERED to afford the appellant his right of election, as described above, after advising him of the difference in benefits between receiving (i) an annuity based on his 1988 separation plus a supplemental annuity based on his reemployment service and (ii) a deferred annuity commencing at age 62 based on his 1994 separation and his total years of federal service. So that the appellant can make a fully-informed election, OPM shall also advise him whether, if he elects a deferred annuity, it will consider him to have received an overpayment of CSRS benefits since 1994.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 589 Fed. Appx. 996 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP) (explaining and distinguishing supplemental and redetermined annuities).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vacchiano v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 1, 3-8 (1991), involving a claim for a redetermined annuity, explained that service credit is not earned by an annuitant who then receives OWCP benefits and becomes reemployed without having been determined by OPM to have recovered or restored to earnings capacity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Postal Service removed the appellant from his position as a City Carrier, effective May 2, 1984, because his medical condition prevented his performing the duties of that position. The appellant subsequently applied for benefits from the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) and also applied for disability-retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). OPM approved the appellant's disability-retirement application, and he received benefits for a short period of time until OWCP approved his application for workers' compensation. The appellant then elected to receive OWCP benefits in lieu of disability-retirement benefits, and OWCP reimbursed the CSRS for all benefits that the appellant had received under that system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In December of 1987, the appellant was instructed to return to work under the Department of Labor's and the Postal Service's Joint Rehabilitation Program. He reported on January 2, 1988, as a full-time Distribution Clerk with modified duties to accommodate his physical limitations. On February 3, 1988, the appellant elected to retire after being informed by the Postal Service that his return to work entitled him to receive retirement-service credit for the time spent on the rolls of OWCP. On March 21, 1988, he elected an optional retirement at a lower, alternative rate together with payment of a lump sum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4331"></span>The appellant began receiving non-disability retirement benefits on February 4, 1988. However, in June of 1989, OPM informed him that it had been erroneously paying him a retirement annuity based on the period of his reemployment. OPM further informed the appellant that, because he had previously retired from the Federal service on disability and had not been found by OPM to be recovered, he was still considered to be an annuitant during the period of his reemployment and, therefore, he was not eligible to elect an optional retirement with an alternative annuity and a lump-sum payment. In addition, OPM informed the appellant that: (1) He was not entitled to a supplemental annuity because he was a reemployed annuitant and had been reemployed for less than one year; and (2) he was not eligible to have his retirement rights redetermined in order to change the type of retirement benefits he received because he was not reemployed for five years. OPM consequently restored the appellant's disability-retirement benefits at the level he was entitled to when he originally retired in May 1984, plus applicable cost-of-living adjustments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for appeal with the Board's Atlanta Regional Office, subsequently withdrawing his request for a hearing because there was no factual dispute in this matter. In her initial decision, the administrative judge did not sustain the portion of OPM's initial decision that denied the appellant's request for additional retirement-service credit for the time he had spent on workers' compensation, finding that it had been error for OPM to apply 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344[1] to the appellant because he was not "receiving annuity from the Fund" during the relevant time. Instead, the administrative judge found that, under <span class="Italic">Losh v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 150, 152-53 (1988), the appellant was entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8151(a) and 8332(f)[3] to service credit for the time during which he received OWCP benefits because he had returned to full-time service after the cessation of those benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 8344(a) of title 5 of the United States Code provides, in pertinent part, that, if a disability annuitant (who is not found by OPM to be recovered) becomes reemployed and serves for one year, upon termination of employment he is entitled to a supplemental annuity based on his period of reemployment. Section 8344(a) further provides that, if the reemployed annuitant is employed for a period of five years, he may elect to have his annuity rights redetermined with credit for all prior service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Section 8151(a) of title 5 of the United States Code provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">In the event the individual resumes employment with the Federal Government, the entire time during which the employee was receiving compensation under this chapter shall be credited to the employee for purposes of within-grade increases, retention purposes, and other rights and benefits based upon length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 8332(f) of title 5 of the United States Code provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">An employee or former employee who returns to duty after a period of separation is deemed, for the purpose of this subsection, to have been in a leave of absence without pay for that part of the period in which he was receiving [OWCP] benefits....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained the portion of OPM's reconsideration decision denying the appellant's request for a non-disability annuity with a lump-sum payment, finding that the appellant did not meet the statutory criteria for a non-disability annuity. In making that determination, the administrative judge cited 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) and <span class="Italic">Herrera v. United States,</span> 849 F.2d 1416, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1988), and explained that applicants for non-disability civil service retirement annuities must meet the "one-out-of-two" eligibility requirement--i.e., one of the last two years of the applicant's Federal service must have been creditable service that was covered under the CSRS. Accordingly, because the appellant had been separated from his position in the Postal Service when he received OWCP benefits and had thereafter been reemployed in a covered position for only one month, the administrative judge found that the appellant had not been engaged in "covered service" for one of the last two years before his separation from Federal service and that he therefore did not meet the eligibility requirements for a non-disability retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM argues that an individual, once awarded an annuity by OPM, remains an "annuitant," whether he or she then elects to receive workers' compensation in lieu of annuity benefits. OPM further argues that the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) govern the award of service credit in connection with the annuities of such reemployed individuals, regardless of whether annuity benefits are being paid at the time of reemployment. We agree.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In his cross-petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that he was not entitled to non-disability retirement because he "did not apply for his non-disability retirement while he was separated from employment." The appellant's assignment of error is without merit, as his status as an "employee" at the time of his application for retirement was not determinative of his eligibility for non-disability retirement. Rather, as the administrative judge correctly found, an employee is required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) to occupy a "covered" position for one out of the last two years before his separation from Federal Service in order to be eligible for a non-disability annuity under CSRS. Therefore, the appellant was not eligible for optional, non-disability retirement with a lump-sum payment when he separated from the Postal Service in 1988 because he had served less than one year in a covered position prior to his separation. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 420, 422 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who otherwise qualifies as an annuitant does not cease to be an annuitant by electing to receive OWCP benefits as authorized by the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) in lieu of annuity benefits under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(f).[5] <span class="Italic"> See True v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 251, 255 (1990). Thus, an individual's status as an annuitant cannot be revoked or withdrawn in order for him to receive credit for the period of time prior to his reemployment when he was not an employee and was receiving OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Section 8337(f) of title 5 of the United States Code bars receipt of both an annuity and OWCP benefits for the same period of time and permits the annuitant to elect to receive the greater of either benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8344 of title 5 of the United States Code governs the reemployment of CSRS annuitants. Except as otherwise provided by the provisions of section 8344, the reemployment of a CSRS annuitant is governed by paragraph (a) of that section, irrespective of the receipt of an annuity at the time of reemployment. Section 8344(a)(1) specifically excludes a disability annuitant who has been found to be recovered or restored to earning capacity from the operation of that section. Accordingly, the reemployment of the appellant here, as an annuitant who is neither recovered nor restored to earning capacity, is properly subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations at Subpart H of Part 831 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations prescribe interpretative and administrative rules governing reemployment under section 8344. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.801(a), an "annuitant" is defined as "a former employee who is receiving, or meets the legal requirements and is an applicant for an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, based on his or her service." The appellant fell within the terms of this definition when he was reemployed on January 2, 1988, and consequently, the benefits derived from his reemployment fell within the provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.803, entitled "Supplemental annuity and redetermined annuity," which sets forth the administrative rules governing entitlement to, and the computation of, post-retirement benefits earned by reemployment under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a). Under the provisions of section 8344 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.803, at least one year of actual, continuous, full-time service, or its part-time equivalent, is necessary to establish title to a supplemental annuity, and at least five years of actual, continuous, full-time service, or its part-time equivalent, is necessary to establish title to a redetermined annuity. The appellant in the instant case met neither of these requirements, as he had only one month of service at the time of his separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the appellant was not subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344 because that statute specifically states that its provisions pertain to annuitants "receiving annuity from the Fund," and the appellant was not actually receiving annuity benefits from the CSRS retirement fund at the time of his reemployment. Although OPM's regulations, as stated above, are in apparent conflict with the literal language of section 8344, we find that such is not the case, and that OPM's application of the statute to any non-recovered disability annuitant who, like the appellant, qualified for disability retirement and filed a claim therefore, constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the statute that is entitled to the Board's deference. <span class="Italic">See Hicks v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 340, 344 (1990) (the construction given a statute by the agency charged with its interpretation is entitled to great deference unless the interpretation is clearly erroneous).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The phrase "receiving annuity from the Fund" was inserted into the provision now codified as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) by the 1966 recodification of title 5, United States Code, Pub. Law No. 89-554, 80 Stat. 378, 581-82 (Sept. 6, 1966). Prior to that enactment, the equivalent provision of CSRS had referred only to "an annuitant under this chapter." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2263(b) (1964). Congress did not intend, however, that the addition in the 1966 recodification of the phrase "receiving annuity from the Fund" after the term "annuitant" would have any substantive effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the legislative history of Public Law No. 89-554, Congress repeatedly emphasized that no changes in the language of the then-existing <span id="Page_4332"></span>provisions of title 5 should be interpreted as substantive amendments. The Senate Report No. 1380, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 18, and House Report No. 901, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, as quoted in the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Benedetto,</span> 847 F.2d 814, 817 (Fed. Cir. 1988), stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The purpose of this bill is to restate in comprehensive form, without substantive change, the statutes in effect before July 1, 1965, that relate to Government employees, the organization and powers of Federal agencies generally, and administrative procedure, and to enact title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both reports also stated that:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">As the underlined portions suggest, Congress was concerned that changes in the language used in certain sections of the act as passed might be interpreted as an intent to change the substance of those sections. The legislative history quoted above makes it clear that Congress did not intend to make substantive changes in the laws <span class="Italic">replaced</span> by the sections it enacted. That this is the correct interpretation of the legislative history is shown by section 7(a) of the 1966 Act, which states that: "[t]he legislative purpose in enacting sections 1-6 of this Act is <span class="Italic">to restate, without substantive change, the laws replaced by those sections</span> on the effective date of this Act." [Emphasis supplied by court.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Benedetto,</span> 847 F.2d at 818. Thus, prior to the 1966 recodification, the phrase "receiving annuity from the Fund" did not appear in the equivalent reemployment provision of title 5, and its addition by Public Law No. 89-554 cannot be given the substantive effect of excluding from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) OWCP recipients who are also "annuitants" under CSRS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is clear that the appellant is an "annuitant" as that term is defined for CSRS by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(9)--he applied for and was granted a CSRS annuity. Accordingly, because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) applies, with certain exceptions inapplicable here, to all reemployed "annuitants," notwithstanding their actual receipt of annuity benefits at the time of reemployment, we find that the administrative judge erred in concluding that the appellant, who elected to receive benefits under FECA instead of CSRS, was not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We recognize that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a) does not expressly preclude annuitants from receiving retirement-service credit for periods of time spent on workers' compensation prior to their reemployment. We nevertheless find that such a result implicitly derives both from the fact that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344 is the only statute that specifically governs the reemployment of annuitants and from the fact that annuitants are not "employees" or "former employees" who are properly subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8151(a) and 8332(f). <span class="Italic">See True</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 254.

OPM,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201008142">829 Fed. Appx. 964</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pybas contends that he is entitled to benefits under &#x00A7; 8421(a)(1) because he is entitled to an annuity under &#x00A7; 8412(d). Section 8412(d), however, provides that an employee who is separated from service is entitled to an annuity under that section only if he has (1) completed 25 years of qualifying service; or (2) completed 20 years of qualifying service and reached the age of 50. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d). There is no dispute here that Mr. Pybas did not meet either of these conditions set forth under &#x00A7; 8412(d) because he retired from service after 14 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to these express statutory requirements, Mr. Pybas argues that disability retirees under &#x00A7; 8451 are categorically entitled to benefits under &#x00A7; 8412(d) because of this court's statement in <span class="Italic">Springer v. Adkins</span> that "retirement under &#x00A7; 8451 does not incorporate the age and years of service requirements of &#x00A7; 8412 except where explicitly stated." 525 F.3d 1363, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Mr. Pybas misreads that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Springer</span>, this court was concerned with the interpretation of the phrase "computed under section 8415" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8452. There, the disability retiree had contended, and the Board had agreed, that he was entitled to an annuity that was no less than the amount computed under &#x00A7; 8415. This was because &#x00A7; 8451(d) provided that disability retirees are entitled to an "annuity computed under section 8452," and &#x00A7; 8452(d)(1) in turn provided that "the annuity to which an annuitant is entitled under this section...shall not be less than the amount of an annuity <span class="Italic">computed under</span> section 8415." <span class="Italic">Springer</span>, 525 F.3d at 1367 (emphasis added). OPM had argued that because &#x00A7; 8415(d) stated that the formula set forth in that subsection applied to the "annuity of an employee retiring under subsection (d) or (e) of section 8412," a retiree must satisfy the age and service requirements set forth in &#x00A7; 8412 in order to receive an annuity "computed under" &#x00A7; 8415 and &#x00A7; 8452. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368-69. Both the Board and this court rejected OPM's argument because there was nothing in the language of either &#x00A7; 8415 or &#x00A7; 8452 that suggests Congress intended to incorporate the requirements of &#x00A7; 8412 into those other provisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, here, &#x00A7; 8421(a)(1) expressly provides that the supplemental annuity under that section is only available "if and while <span class="Italic">entitled to an annuity under</span>...section 8412." &#x00A7; 8421(a)(1) (emphasis added). Unlike the "computed under" language in &#x00A7; 8452(d), the phrase "entitled to an annuity under" in &#x00A7; 8421(a)(1) is an express statement that Congress intended for the supplemental annuity under &#x00A7; 8421(a)(1) to be available only when the retiree satisfies the requirements set forth in the applicable referenced statute, including the requirements in &#x00A7; 8412(d).[1] Thus, the plain text of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8421(a)(1) and 8412(d) make clear that Mr. Pybas is not entitled to a FERS annuity supplement because he failed to satisfy the age and service requirements of &#x00A7; 8412(d). Disability retirement under &#x00A7; 8451 does not create an exception to those requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The other decisions on which Petitioner relies can be distinguished on similar grounds. <span class="Italic">See Wassenaar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 F.3d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (interpreting the phrase "an annuity computed under section 8339(a)-(f), (i), (n), (p), and (q)" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 as not incorporating the age and service criteria for eligibility identified in &#x00A7; 8336(c) even though that provision is referenced in &#x00A7; 8339(d)(1)); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 F.3d 216, 217 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Pybas's position is foreclosed by the statutory text, we cannot agree with his arguments based on legislative history and policy. <span class="Italic">See Decosta v. United States</span>, 987 F.2d 1556, 1558 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (holding that "legislative history cannot override the plain meaning of a statute"); <span class="Italic">SAS Institute, Inc. v. Iancu</span>, 138 S. Ct. 1348, 1352 (2018) (noting that a party's "policy argument" is "properly addressed to Congress, not this Court").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with Mr. Pybas's argument that he is entitled to the FERS annuity supplement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.503, 842.208. He does not dispute that the plain text of &#x00A7; 842.208 contains the same age and service requirements identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412, which he does not satisfy. Moreover, we cannot construe and enforce OPM's regulations contrary to the plain text of the governing statutes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Strickler v. OPM</span>, 51 MSPR 354, 359 (1991) (employee received disability annuity, then went on OWCP, and was then reemployed: "because OPM originally granted the appellant's application for disability retirement and did not determine subsequently that the appellant no longer satisfied the statutory definition of an 'annuitant,' the appellant's reemployment as an annuitant fell under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(a). OPM, therefore, correctly denied the appellant's request for recomputation of his disability annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(f)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Roman v. OPM</span>, 549 Fed. Appx. 1010 (Fed.

Thus, although a reemployed annuitant who received OWCP benefits may be granted additional service credit under sections 8151(a) and 8332(f), the issue of whether this additional service credit results in a fully redetermined annuity, a supplemental annuity, or no additional annuity (in the case of reemployment lasting less than the equivalent of 1 year of full time service) is governed by section 8344.").</p>
