<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-91"><span class="space">2.</span> Method of Analysis</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">When retreat rights are analyzed a distinction is drawn between classification of a position and a comparison of positions to determine whether they are identical or substantially similar. That two positions have different titles does not necessarily demonstrate that the positions are dissimilar. The duties, not classifications, control. <span class="Italic">MacDonald v. EPA</span>, 1 MSPR 471, 473, 1 MSPB 456 (1980). The Board looks to evidence beyond the position description to determine if the job sought and the job obtained through promotion are essentially the same. <span class="Italic">Lover v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 407, 409 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's qualifications for assignment and retreat rights under RIF regulations are determined as of the effective date of the release from his competitive level. <span class="Italic">McMahon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 MSPR 159, 161-62 (1984) (the agency erred by considering qualifications only on the date the RIF notice was issued). The standards to be met in order to be considered qualified for assignment in a RIF are somewhat different from and higher than those required to be considered qualified for consideration under agency merit promotion announcements. <span class="Italic">Connor v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 22 MSPR 123, 127 (1984) (relying upon <span class="Italic">Jamison v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 20 MSPR 513 (1984)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Labor Relations Authority attempted to synthesize, in the process of reviewing an arbitration award, the teachings of Board cases concerning the definition and application of retreat rights. <span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv. and AFGE Local 3157</span>, 23 FLRA 141, 144-45 (1986), set aside the award of an arbitrator who determined that under the then-prevailing regulations an employee should be able to retreat to the entry level of a position even if the employee had not held the job at the entry level:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Merit Systems Protection Board has repeatedly recognized that the right of retreat is narrow and specific. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shell v. Dept. of Labor</span>, CH03518410511 (March 25, 1985). Specifically, at all relevant times, an employee has been entitled under 5 CFR Part 351, subpart G, to retreat only to the same position or an essentially identical position previously held by the employee. The Board has noted that OPM has elaborated on retreat rights in FPM Chapter 351, subchapter 4-3b, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHUD</span>, DE03518310282 (August 2, 1984)....&#8197;Thus, the Board has indicated that it will find a position to be substantially the same...when the positions are sufficiently alike so that they could be in the same competitive level. <span class="Italic">Lover v. DHHS</span>, DC0351841089 (October 1, 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of qualifications analysis as to a claimed retreat right is <span class="Italic">Parkhurst v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 70 MSPR 309, 311-14 (1996) (Member Amador dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant served as a Secretary (Stenography) (Secretary-S), GS-318-5, position no. EA-CO37, with the agency from 1986 until 1989. She served as a GS-7 Air Traffic Assistant from 1989 until her separation in 1995. In 1993, the agency amended the position description and title for position no. EA-CO37 by adding the requirement that the incumbent have knowledge of computer software. Most of the primary duties of position no. EA-C037, now known as Secretary (Stenography, Office Automation) (Secretary-SOA), are performed with computer programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the Secretary-SOA position to which the appellant sought to retreat is not the same as or essentially identical to the Secretary-S position she held, based on the additional specialized knowledge now required for the position. As explained below, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A position is "essentially identical" to one previously held if the two positions would properly be placed in the same competitive level. <span class="Italic">See Evans v. Department of the Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 492, 495 (1994). Positions belong in the same competitive level if they are in the same grade and classification series, and are "similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that the incumbent of one position could successfully perform the critical elements of any other position upon entry into it, without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403(a). Whether positions should be in the same competitive level depends on the duties and qualifications of the positions, as set forth in the official position descriptions. <span class="Italic">See Jicha v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 73, 77 (1994); <span class="Italic"><span id="Page_3090"></span>Estrin v. Social Security Administration</span>, 24 MSPR 303, 307 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While in some jobs, technological advances may result in a fundamental change in the essential duties, that is not the case here. Based on the relevant position descriptions, the secretarial position at issue remains a secretarial position. Some of the tools used to perform the secretarial duties have changed, but the duties themselves have not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to qualifications, the only material difference between the Secretary-SOA and Secretary-S positions is that the Secretary-SOA position requires: "Knowledge of automation systems sufficient to use several types of software for various office needs. Ability to use processing procedures and functions keys for performing substantial range of functions within each software type." This standard is rather vague; it does not require knowledge of any particular software package. Absent any indication in the Secretary-SOA position description that the software is extraordinarily difficult to use, we have no basis for concluding that someone possessing secretarial skills who undertook to learn the Secretary-SOA software would create a "loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's argument that the office automation duties attached to the Secretary-SOA position are classified in series 326 (as opposed to the 318 Secretary series) is unpersuasive. In fact, the Secretary-SOA and Secretary-S positions are both classified in the 318 series. The Office Automation Grade Evaluation Guide relied upon by the agency is meant to assist agencies in assigning a grade level to Office Automation duties. It is not designed for classification purposes. Likewise, the Office Automation Clerical and Assistance Series Guide relied upon by the agency requires agencies to: "Classify in the Secretary Series, GS-318, a position which is the principal office clerical or administrative support position in an office and operates independently of any other such position in the office." Thus, it does not support the agency's argument that the Secretary-SOA position is classified in the 326 series.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Secretary-SOA position to which the appellant seeks to retreat is the same as or essentially identical to the Secretary-S position she previously held. The initial decision is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Secretary-SOA and Secretary-S positions are the same or essentially identical, the appellant has a retreat right to the Secretary-SOA position, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(c)(3), so long as she is qualified for it, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a); <span class="Italic">cf. Hao v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 125, 127 (1993). The appellant is qualified for the Secretary-SOA position if she: (1) Meets OPM standards for the position, including any minimum education requirement and any selective placement factors established by the agency; (2) is physically qualified; (3) meets any special OPM-approved qualifying condition; and (4) "[c]learly demonstrates on the basis of overall background, including recency of experience, a positive ability to successfully perform all critical elements of the specific position upon entry into it, without undue interruption to [the agency's operations] and without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge never made a finding on the qualification issue. She did appear to credit the testimony of a Personnel Staffing Assistant, who opined that the appellant does not meet the current knowledge requirements of the Secretary-SOA position. It appears, however, that the appellant used a computer in her Air Traffic Assistant Position, that she took a six-week course in computer programming in 1988, and that she has used different types of software (e.g., Lotus 1-2-3 and Wordperfect). Thus, the appellant may have "[k]nowledge of automation systems sufficient to use several types of software" and "[a]bility to use processing procedures and functions keys for performing substantial range of functions within each software type," the qualification standard that the agency has established for the Secretary-SOA position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appeal must be REMANDED for an express finding on whether the appellant is qualified for the Secretary-SOA position. Specifically, the administrative judge should determine whether the agency has established any "selective placement factors" for the Secretary-SOA position, and if so, whether the appellant meets those factors. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(1). The administrative judge should further determine whether the appellant "[c]learly demonstrates...[the] ability to successfully perform all critical elements of the specific position...without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4). The administrative judge should also determine whether the appellant meets the remaining requirements of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a), to the extent that they apply.</p>

DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 426, 433 &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (reiterating <span class="Italic">Parkhurst</span> analysis); <span class="Italic">Pigford v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 75 MSPR 250, 256 (1997) (comparing secretarial positions and determining that they were essentially identical for retreat purposes even though the position sought by retreat lost some skill requirements the appellant once used in that job and later used in the job lost by RIF); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Henderson v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Simonton v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 30, 33-35 (1994), decided that an employee may claim a position through a retreat right that he had once held and that was subsequently upgraded through reclassification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Further, we note that, before an agency can invoke RIF regulations based on the abolishment of a job, it must establish that an appellant's position was actually abolished and that it did not continue under a different grade or title<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of the Army</span>, 41 MSPR 612, 616 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 914 F.2d 271 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Nor do the regulations apply where a position is reclassified because of the application of new standards, the correction of a classification error, or (with limited exceptions) an erosion of duties<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.202(c)(2), (c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we recognize that the issue here does not involve the abolishment of the appellant's position at the time of the RIF but rather the earlier reclassification of his former position, we find that our underlying concern for requiring that an agency show a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reason for the RIF action, i.e., that employees not be deprived of their jobs by simply "slipp[ing]" their duties under the shell of a new position with nothing of substance having changed, applies to the limited situation at issue here<span class="Italic">. See Hoffman v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 22 MSPR 564, 568 (1984), quoting <span class="Italic">Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission</span>, 2 MSPR 195, 199 (1980). We find, as the administrative judge concluded, that an employee should not be deprived of his retreat rights to a former position simply because the duties that he performed in that position have been determined by a classification action to warrant a higher grade than when he occupied that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, we find it significant that the agency acknowledges that the appellant's former position was upgraded primarily because of the application of a new classification standard, even though it contends that there has also been an evolution of duties. In <span class="Italic">Russell</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of Navy</span>, 6 MSPB 585, 6 MSPR 698, 710-11 (1981), we found that the appellant was constructively reduced in grade when he was reassigned from a position that was subsequently upgraded where he would have received the promotion but for his reassignment. There, we noted the importance of the classification system to the integrity of the merit system and that an employee's entitlement to the correct grade was a benefit that resulted from its proper operation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 710. We also note that the purpose of setting competitive levels under the regulations is to ensure that positions that are truly alike be made available for competition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403. Grade level is only one usual indication of such similarity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency has an interest in minimum disruption during a RIF, we find that such interest is outweighed where an appellant establishes that he would have been entitled to the higher grade in his former position. To the extent that there has been a change in duties here so that the positions are not the same, this issue will be reviewed by the administrative judge in deciding whether the positions are essentially identical. <span class="Italic">See Holliday v. Department of Army</span>, 11 MSPB 14, 12 MSPR 358, 362 (1982) (qualifications required by duties of positions as set forth in position descriptions, not the personal qualifications of specific incumbents, determine composition of competitive levels). In this connection, we note that the appellant's former position has not been upgraded to a level at or above that of his job at the time of the RIF, and we therefore do not address what would happen if it had been. <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.704(b)(1)<span class="Italic">. Compare Sokol v. Department of Education</span>, 19 MSPR 466, 470 (1984) (the appellant had retreat rights to a GM-14 position based on his prior incumbency of a GS-14 position) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403(b)(3), (b)(5) (requiring different competitive levels for jobs in different pay systems and based on differing supervisory/nonsupervisory status).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's ruling that the appellant is not precluded from exercising his retreat rights to his former position solely because it was reclassified to a higher level after he no longer occupied it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the nature of evidence the AJ should consider in determining whether the position once held by the appellant was identical to the upgraded position, <span class="Italic">Simonton</span>, 62 MSPR at 35-36, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the issue of whether the administrative judge should allow the parties to submit testimony regarding the actual duties performed. In determining that the Board's position was not clear, he reviewed our decisions in <span class="Italic">Marcinowsky v. General Services Administration</span>, 35 MSPR 6, 9-10 (1987) (where we considered the critical elements and performance standards in determining whether the positions belonged in the same competitive level); <span class="Italic">Lover v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 23 MSPR 407, 409 (1984) (where we found that the results of a "position review" were admissible in determining a retreat rights claim); and <span class="Italic">Burbridge v. Government of District of Columbia</span>, 11 MSPB 601, 13 MSPR 360, 362 (1982) (where we found that the propriety of separate <span id="Page_3091"></span>competitive levels was shown by the position descriptions of record inasmuch as the appellant failed to present further evidence showing specific similarities of duties performed by incumbents of both positions). Finally, the administrative judge, noting that it was the most recent of the decisions cited, quoted our decision in <span class="Italic">Marcinowsky</span>, 35 MSPR at 9 (citations omitted), stating that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The duties and responsibilities of the official position descriptions have been, and continue to be, an appropriate and necessary means by which to determine the composition of a competitive level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reaffirm our statement in <span class="Italic">Marcinowsky.</span> We find that whether positions are in the same competitive level is mainly determined by the official position descriptions, even though other evidence may also be relevant in light of the circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 575-76 (1994), we found that there were apparently significant differences in the duties, qualification requirements, and working conditions to the extent that an incumbent of one position may not be able to successfully perform the critical elements of the other position without any abnormal loss of productivity. In making that determination, we relied solely on our review of the pleadings and of the position descriptions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 575-76. Similarly, we have relied mainly on a comparison of the official position descriptions in determining whether a position was actually abolished<span class="Italic">. See Holmes</span>, 41 MSPR at 616 ("The Board will examine all of the record evidence, particularly the position descriptions, in making this determination").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That we have relied on the official position descriptions, however, does not mean that we have excluded other relevant evidence, including testimony, especially where such evidence sheds light on the position descriptions. <span class="Italic">See Marcinowsky</span>, 35 MSPR at 10 (the applicable FPM provision includes agency examination of the critical elements and the performance standards, as well as the position descriptions; the administrative judge properly supported his finding, that the positions required different subject matter and technical expertise that could not be readily acquired, based on the statements of the agency official whom he credited); <span class="Italic">Lover</span>, 23 MSPR at 409 (the position review contained a position description indicating that the appellant supervised three employees rather than one as claimed by the agency); <span class="Italic">Burbridge</span>, 13 MSPR at 362, citing <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 9 MSPB 109, 9 MSPR 472, 475 (1982) (the testimony and the agency admissions can form a sufficient basis for deciding the propriety of the competitive level absent the official position description). And, as noted above, the relevant FPM provision, subsection S-5-5d, states that the "essentially identical" determination is made "on the basis of the information available." Thus, it does not appear to limit consideration solely to the position descriptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge should allow the parties to present testimony regarding the actual duties performed in the positions in question, but only to the extent that such evidence is material and relevant to an understanding of the appropriate position descriptions, critical elements and performance standards....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Warren v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 426, 433 &#x00B6; 16 (2001) (reiterating the primacy of a position description, as illuminated by other evidence); <span class="Italic">Pigford v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 75 MSPR 250 (1997) (when analyzing retreat rights, "[a]n administrative judge...may allow testimony regarding the actual duties performed in the positions in question to the extent that it is relevant and material to an understanding of the appropriate position descriptions, critical elements and performance standards"); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 487, 490 (1994) (as to retreat claims: although "position descriptions are significant evidence in determining whether positions are in the same competitive level, other evidence, such as testimony regarding the actual duties performed in a position, may also be relevant in light of the circumstances, especially where such evidence sheds light on the position descriptions").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Simonton</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Dube v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 394, 397-99 (1996). The agency properly declined to permit the exercise of retreat rights to a position with a higher representative rate when the position sought by retreat was not upgraded at the time of the RIF through change in grade or pay due to a classification action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he proper application of these procedures allows the appellant to "retreat" into the WD-9 position if it was encumbered by an employee with a lower retention standing in the same tenure group and subgroup, was at the same grade as, or no more than three grades below, the position from which the appellant was released, and was the same position he previously held, or an essentially identical one. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the RIF regulations specify that the determination of grade levels must be based upon a comparison of representative rates, and that an employee's assignment rights are determined on the bases of the pay rates in effect on the date of issuance of the RIF notice, except when it is officially known on the date of issuance that new pay rates have been approved and will become effective by the effective date of the RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(e). As the administrative judge found here, passage of FEPCA has caused the WD-9 position to have a higher representative rate than the appellant's GS-11 position at the time of the RIF. Proper application of the RIF procedures, therefore, precludes the appellant's placement into the WD-9 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we disagree with the appellant's assertion that FPM Supplement 351-1 provides a basis for augmenting the representative rate of the GS-11 position. As the administrative judge found, pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 5304(c)(2), locality-based comparability payments may only be considered to be a part of basic pay for certain enumerated purposes, such as retirement, life insurance, and premium pay, and for other purposes that may be expressly provided for by law or OPM regulation. The administrative judge further correctly found that none of the relevant regulations expressly provide for use of locality-based comparability payments in determining representative rates of pay for RIF purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.606(b). The appellant's assertion that the FPM Supplement provides such authority does not establish that the administrative judge erred in this regard because, to the extent the FPM continues to exist, it is mere guidance, and does not have regulatory authority. <span class="Italic">See Simonton</span>, 62 MSPR at 33 &#x0026; n.2. <span class="Italic">See also Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 MSPR 395, 396 n.2 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 95 F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Moreover, as stated above, OPM has specifically stated that it has consciously excluded locality pay for representative rate of pay determinations under the RIF regulations. We find OPM's interpretation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 5304(c)(2) reasonable and consistent with the statute's plain meaning, and, therefore, conclude that it is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See Balick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 F.3d 586, 588-89 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the administrative judge's finding that equitable considerations warrant deviation from application of the RIF regulations. In addition to the reasons set forth by OPM above regarding equitable considerations, the Board has also previously held that such considerations do not provide a basis for deviating from the prescribed application of the RIF regulations. In <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, the Board held that while the agency's desire to minimize disruption, expense, and adverse effects on its employees during a major reorganization was understandable and commendable, the agency could not disregard the applicable statutory and regulatory RIF provisions, and adherence to the RIF regulations was mandatory. 63 MSPR at 324.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 7 MSPB 246, 7 MSPR 366, 369 (1981), the Board similarly focused on strict adherence to the RIF regulations rather than allow an exception based upon equitable considerations. There, the Board affirmed an appellant's placement into a WS-7 position, instead of a lower graded GS-11 position, even though there was evidence that the GS-11 position would be subject to a future raise that would give it a higher representative rate than the WS-7 position. The Board found that the appellant was not entitled to be placed into the GS-11 position because the raise was neither in effect nor officially known on the date of the RIF notice's issuance, as required under the RIF regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that our decision in <span class="Italic">Simonton</span> is distinguishable from the present case. There, the Board held that an employee should not be deprived of his right to retreat into a former position simply because the duties he formerly performed in that position had been determined by a classification action to warrant a higher grade than when he occupied it. 62 MSPR at 34. In contrast, the present case does not involve a change in grade or pay due to a classification action. Further, the Board specifically noted in <span class="Italic">Simonton</span> that the appellant's former position was not upgraded to a level at or above that of his job at the time of the RIF, and the Board's decision specifically left open the question of the result in that circumstance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 35.</p>
