<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-30"><span class="space">c.</span> Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A significant restriction on waivers is established by the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), a statute that amended the ADEA. Any settlement that explicitly or impliedly seeks to secure a waiver of a past, present, or potential age discrimination claim should conform to the requirements of 29 USC 626(f):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Waiver</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;An individual may not waive any right or claim under this chapter unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary. Except as provided in paragraph (2), a waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;the waiver is part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be <span id="Page_4783"></span>understood by such individual, or by the average individual eligible to participate;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims arising under this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;the individual does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;the individual waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individual already is entitled;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003;the individual is advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(F)(i)&#x2003;the individual is given a period of at least 21 days within which to consider the agreement; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;if a waiver is requested in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees, the individual is given a period of at least 45 days within which to consider the agreement;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(G)&#x2003;the agreement provides that for a period of at least 7 days following the execution of such agreement, the individual may revoke the agreement, and the agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the revocation period has expired;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(H)&#x2003;if a waiver is requested in connection with an exit incentive or other employment termination program offered to a group or class of employees, the employer (at the commencement of the period specified in subparagraph (F)) informs the individual in writing in a manner calculated to be understood by the average individual eligible to participate, as to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;any class, unit, or group of individuals covered by such program, any eligibility factors for such program, and any time limits applicable to such program; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;the job titles and ages of all individuals eligible or selected for the program, and the ages of all individuals in the same job classification or organizational unit who are not eligible or selected for the program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;A waiver in settlement of a charge filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or an action filed in court by the individual or the individual's representative, alleging age discrimination of a kind prohibited under section 623 or 633a of this title may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1) have been met; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;the individual is given a reasonable period of time within which to consider the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;In any dispute that may arise over whether any of the requirements, conditions, and circumstances set forth in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), or (H) of paragraph (1), or subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2), have been met, the party asserting the validity of a waiver shall have the burden of proving in a court of competent jurisdiction that a waiver was knowing and voluntary pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;No waiver agreement may affect the Commission's rights and responsibilities to enforce this chapter. No waiver may be used to justify interfering with the protected right of an employee to file a charge or participate in an investigation or proceeding conducted by the Commission.</p>

This is permissible as long as the employee's decision to accept such shortening of time is knowing and voluntary and is not induced by the employer through fraud, misrepresentation, a threat to withdraw or alter the offer prior to the expiration of the 21 or 45 day time period, or by providing different terms to employees who sign the release prior to the expiration of such time period. However, if an employee signs a release before the expiration of the 21 or 45 day time period, the employer may expedite the processing of the consideration provided in exchange for the waiver.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Supreme Court interpreted and enforced the OWBPA in <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc.,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1998944522us4221922">118 S. Ct. 838</a>, 840-42 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee, as part of a termination agreement, signed a release of all claims against her employer. In consideration, she received severance pay in installments. The release, however, did not comply with specific federal statutory requirements for a release of claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, 29 USC &#x00A7; 621 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> After receiving the last payment, the employee brought suit under the ADEA. The employer claims the employee ratified and validated the nonconforming release by retaining the monies paid to secure it. The employer also insists the release bars the action unless, as a precondition to filing suit, the employee tenders back the monies received. We disagree and rule that, as the release did not comply with the statute, it cannot bar the ADEA claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) imposes specific requirements for releases covering ADEA claims. OWBPA, &#x00A7; 201, 104 Stat. 983, 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(B), (F), (G). In procuring the release, Entergy did not comply with the OWBPA in at least three respects: (1) Entergy did not give Oubre enough time to consider her options. (2) Entergy did not give Oubre seven days after she signed the release to change her mind. And (3) the release made no specific reference to claims under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Oubre filed a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which dismissed her charge on the merits but issued a right-to-sue letter. She filed this suit against Entergy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging constructive discharge on the basis of her age in violation of the ADEA and state law. Oubre has not offered or tried to return the $6,258 to Entergy, nor is it clear she has the means to do so. Entergy moved for summary judgment, claiming Oubre had ratified the defective release by failing to return or offer to return the monies she had received....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The employer maintains...that before the innocent party can elect avoidance, she must first tender back any benefits received under the contract.... If she fails to do so within a reasonable time after learning of her rights, the employer contends, she ratifies the contract and so makes it binding....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These general rules may not be as unified as the employer asserts. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Annot., 76 A.L.R. 344 (1932) (collecting cases supporting and contradicting these rules); Annot., 134 A.L.R. 6 (1941) (same). And in equity, a person suing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 3 Restatement (Second) of Contracts, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 384, and Comment <span class="Italic">b</span>; Restatement of Restitution &#x00A7; 65, Comment <span class="Italic">d</span> (1936); D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#x00A7; 4.8, p. 294 (1973). Even if the employer's statement of the general rule requiring tender back before one files suit were correct, it would be unavailing. The rule cited is based simply on the course of negotiation of the parties and the alleged later ratification. The authorities cited do not consider the question raised by statutory standards for releases and a statutory declaration making non-conforming releases ineffective. It is the latter question we confront here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1990, Congress amended the ADEA by passing the OWBPA. The OWBPA provides: "An individual may not waive any right or claim under [the ADEA] unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary.... [A] waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum" it satisfies certain enumerated requirements, including the three listed above. 29 USC &#x00A7; 626(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory command is clear: An employee "may not waive" an ADEA claim unless the waiver or release satisfies the OWBPA's requirements. <span id="Page_4784"></span>The policy of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act is likewise clear from its title: It is designed to protect the rights and benefits of older workers. The OWBPA implements Congress' policy via a strict, unqualified statutory stricture on waivers, and we are bound to take Congress at its word. Congress imposed specific duties on employers who seek releases of certain claims created by statute. Congress delineated these duties with precision and without qualification: An employee "may not waive" an ADEA claim unless the employer complies with the statute. Courts cannot with ease presume ratification of that which Congress forbids.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OWBPA sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of ADEA waivers, separate and apart from contract law. The statute creates a series of prerequisites for knowing and voluntary waivers and imposes affirmative duties of disclosure and waiting periods. The OWBPA governs the effect under federal law of waivers or releases on ADEA claims and incorporates no exceptions or qualifications. The text of the OWBPA forecloses the employer's defense, notwithstanding how general contract principles would apply to non-ADEA claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule proposed by the employer would frustrate the statute's practical operation as well as its formal command. In many instances a discharged employee likely will have spent the monies received and will lack the means to tender their return. These realities might tempt employers to risk noncompliance with the OWBPA's waiver provisions, knowing it will be difficult to repay the monies and relying on ratification. We ought not to open the door to an evasion of the statute by this device.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Oubre's cause of action arises under the ADEA, and the release can have no effect on her ADEA claim unless it complies with the OWBPA. In this case, both sides concede the release the employee signed did not comply with the requirements of the OWBPA. Since Oubre's release did not comply with the OWBPA's stringent safeguards, it is unenforceable against her insofar as it purports to waive or release her ADEA claim. As a statutory matter, the release cannot bar her ADEA suit, irrespective of the validity of the contract as to other claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In further proceedings in this or other cases, courts may need to inquire whether the employer has claims for restitution, recoupment, or setoff against the employee, and these questions may be complex where a release is effective as to some claims but not as to ADEA claims. We need not decide those issues here, however. It suffices to hold that the release cannot bar the ADEA claim because it does not conform to the statute. Nor did the employee's mere retention of monies amount to a ratification equivalent to a valid release of her ADEA claims, since the retention did not comply with the OWBPA any more than the original release did. The statute governs the effect of the release on ADEA claims, and the employer cannot invoke the employee's failure to tender back as a way of excusing its own failure to comply.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board accepted a determination by EEOC that an appellant could challenge a removal based on an ADEA claim that was not properly waived under the OWBPA, even when the parties had ostensibly settled other components of a removal appeal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant seeks once again to have the settlement agreement rendered invalid because of the deficiency of the waiver of his right to pursue further relief under the ADEA. The appellant has presented no new and material evidence previously unavailable to serve as a basis for finding that the administrative judge erred. Nor has he offered any such evidence to support reopening and modifying our previous decision in this regard. He has cited, however, to a decision by the EEOC in support of his argument, <span class="Italic">Hall v. England</span>, EEOC Petition No. 01A25074 WL 137826 (Jan. 9, 2003).

Nevertheless, we find that the outcome of the appellant's case is not determined by the holding in <span class="Italic">Hall</span>. First, we are unable to determine from that decision whether the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Hall</span> are sufficiently like these to make the <span class="Italic">Hall</span> decision persuasive. More important, it appears that the settlement agreement at issue in <span class="Italic">Hall</span> disposed of only EEO complaints and not an appeal before the Board. Thus, the decision in <span class="Italic">Hall</span> does not stand for the proposition that a settlement agreement, deficient as a matter of EEO law, cannot be effective as to issues outside of the purview of the EEOC in an appeal before the Board. We note that, in the case before the Board, the EEOC did not find that, as a matter of EEO law, the deficient waiver renders the waiver of all discrimination claims within the EEOC's jurisdiction invalid. Rather, the Commission declined to address that issue because the appellant failed to raise that argument before it.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When the appellant filed his initial appeal, he alleged the action involved prohibited discrimination based on age and disability. There is no evidence in the record that the appellant withdrew the discrimination claim prior to signing the settlement agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We read the appellant's petition for review as arguing that his claim of age discrimination cannot be waived unless, in executing the settlement agreement, the agency complied with the provisions of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (OWBPA). In <span class="Italic">Campo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 419 (2003), the Board concurred in and adopted the decision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that, before accepting a settlement agreement in an appeal where age discrimination has been alleged, the Board must first verify that the agency has complied with the provisions of the OWBPA. Since the EEOC's decision in <span class="Italic">Campo</span> was a decision based on discrimination law, we apply it here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OWBPA, which is codified in relevant part at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f), amended the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The OWBPA states in section 626(f)(1) that a waiver of an ADEA claim may not be considered "knowing and voluntary" unless, at a minimum, eight conditions are met. Those eight conditions are numbered as subparagraphs (A) through (H) of section 626(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection 626(f)(2) goes on to say that a waiver in a settlement of a charge filed with the EEOC or an action filed with a court may not be considered "knowing and voluntary" unless, at a minimum, subparagraphs (A) through (E) of subsection 626(f)(1) are met, and "the individual is given a reasonable period of time within which to consider the settlement agreement." The EEOC has applied section 626(f)(2) to mixed-case appeals, that is, to Board appeals which involve a claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Campo v. Potter,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03A20012, 2002 WL 31094095 (Aug. 23, 2002). Accordingly, we find that subsection 626(f)(2) of Title 29 applies to settlements of Board cases. Thus, before accepting a settlement of an appeal involving a claim of age discrimination, an AJ should inquire whether subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 626(f)(1) were followed and whether the appellant was given a "reasonable period of time" to consider the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 626(f)(1) state that a waiver of an ADEA claim is knowing and voluntary if</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;the waiver is part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be understood by such individual, or by the average individual eligible to participate;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims arising under this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;the individual does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;the individual waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individual already is entitled; [and]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003;the individual is advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2). Further, the statute provides that in any dispute which may arise over whether any of the above requirements, conditions, and circumstances have been met, the party asserting the validity of the waiver shall have the burden of proving in a court of competent jurisdiction that a waiver was knowing and voluntary under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f). 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the tape of the parties' settlement agreement is inaudible, we find, based on the initial decision's description of the terms of the settlement agreement, and the agency's mistaken belief on review that the appellant had not raised an age discrimination claim below, that the agreement in this case likely did not, at a minimum, comply with section 626(f)(2)'s requirement that the waiver specifically refer to rights or claims arising under the ADEA. In any event and as noted above, in a dispute over whether the requirements of section 626(f)(2) have been met, the party asserting the validity of the waiver has the burden of proving that the waiver was knowing and voluntary. The agency, which has "rest[ed] on the record," has not satisfied this burden. <span class="Italic">See Campo,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03A20012, 2002 WL 31094095, slip op. at 4 n.6 (where the agency provided no documentation or argument to convince the EEOC that the agency advised the petitioner in writing to consult an attorney before executing the agreement, or gave the petitioner a reasonable amount of time to consider the agreement, the EEOC could not conclude that those OWBPA conditions were satisfied). Thus, we find that the agreement in this case did not comply with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that the settlement agreement did not comply with section 626(f)(2), we turn to the effect of this determination on this appeal. The appellant contends that because he alleged that his removal was based on age discrimination, "the law" permits him to rescind the settlement agreement within seven days. The appellant has not identified which law so provides. We note that subparagraph (G) of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1) provides for a seven-day period in which to revoke a settlement agreement. As explained above, however, only subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 626(f)(1) apply to settlement agreements in Board appeals. Thus, the agreement here was not defective under the OWBPA in not providing a seven-day revocation period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not alleged, let alone established, that the agreement is invalid based on fraud, misrepresentation, mutual mistake, or any other ground recognized by the Board as a basis for setting aside a settlement agreement. The appellant has not even argued that there is a nexus between the agency's failure to comply with section 626(f)(2) and his decision to enter into the agreement. Instead, he wants to rescind the agreement because he has changed his mind about one of the agreement's terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In concurring with the EEOC's referral in <span class="Italic">Campo,</span> the Board adopted EEOC's view that unless an appellant specifically shows how the other parts of a settlement agreement are invalid, only the portion of the agreement waiving an age discrimination claim will be nullified if the agency did not comply with the OWBPA. 93 M.S.P.B. 419 &#x00B6; 10. Moreover, the OWBPA does not say that the entire settlement agreement is invalid if the waiver of an age discrimination claim is not "knowing and voluntary." Since the appellant has shown no basis for invalidating the entire agreement, we find that the settlement agreement is still in effect with respect to all but the appellant's ADEA-related claim. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13 and 14.[2] Thus, the merits of the removal action are not at issue except to the extent that the AJ needs to address them to decide whether the appellant can prove his affirmative defense of age discrimination. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6; 13.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant raised a claim of age discrimination below, and she generally disputes the inclusion of her claims of EEO discrimination in the settlement agreement. Before accepting a settlement agreement of an appeal in which age discrimination has been alleged, the Board must first verify that the agency has complied with the provisions of the OWBPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(A)-(E), (f)(2); <span class="Italic">Hinton</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 7.

Here, the agreement does not meet these requirements because it is oral and there is no indication that the agency advised the appellant to consult with an attorney.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant refiled his appeal, after which the parties entered into a written agreement to settle the appeal. The agency agreed to pay the appellant $10,000.00 in settlement of his appeal. The appellant agreed, among other things, to withdraw his appeal; any equal employment opportunity complaints against the agency "arising out of the facts of this case"; and all claims, grievances, lawsuits, and other appeals related to this appeal, except those filed through the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs. The parties additionally agreed that the appellant would not accrue any annual pay, back pay, annual leave, sick pay, sick leave, or severance pay under the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a March 25, 2004 initial decision, the administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal as settled, after incorporating the agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. The AJ found that the settlement agreement was lawful on its face and freely entered into by the parties in a matter over which the Board has jurisdiction, and that the parties understood its terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, through counsel, has filed a petition for review of the initial decision, as well as a supplemental brief, in which he argues that the settlement agreement is void for failure to comply with the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (OWBPA)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Before accepting a settlement agreement in an appeal where age discrimination has been alleged, the Board must first verify that the agency has complied with the provisions of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (OWBPA).<span class="Italic"> Lange v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;Waiver</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;An individual may not waive any right or claim under this chapter unless the waiver is knowing and voluntary. Except as provided in paragraph (2), a waiver may not be considered knowing and voluntary unless at a minimum--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote4">(E)&#x2003;the individual is advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant raised allegations of age discrimination. The OWBPA applies to the appellant's age discrimination claim because it was made under "this chapter," i.e. under 29 U.S.C. chapter 14, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) as amended. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) (making the ADEA applicable to executive branch agencies). Nevertheless, the administrative judge made no finding that the settlement agreement complied with the OWBPA. Our review of the settlement agreement shows that it fails to meet several of the requirements of the OWBPA. Specifically, the agreement does not explicitly refer to waiver of claims arising under the ADEA, and there is no indication that the agency ever advised the appellant in writing to consult with an attorney prior to entering into the agreement. HT; <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(0(1)(B), (E); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). In addition, we find that this oral settlement agreement fails to comply with the OWBPA because the OWBPA requires that <span id="Page_4787"></span>waiver of an ADEA claim be in writing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(A). Courts have issued conflicting decisions on the OWBPA's writing requirement. <span class="Italic">Compare Williams v. Cigna Financial Advisors, Inc.,</span> 56 F.3d 656, 660 (5th Cir. 1995) (the OWBPA requires that the waiver of a claim be in writing), <span class="Italic">with Powell v. Omnicom,</span> 497 F.3d 124, 128-32 (2d Cir. 2007) (upholding an oral waiver of an ADEA claim under the OWBPA). However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has interpreted the OWBPA as requiring that "[t]he entire waiver agreement must be in writing," 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1625.22(b)(2), and the Board will defer to this interpretation because it is purely a matter of substantive discrimination law, <span class="Italic">see Evans v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 9 (2007); <span class="Italic">Campo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (2003). Because the appellant's waiver of his ADEA claim was not "knowing and voluntary" within the meaning of the OWBPA, the administrative judge erred in finding that the settlement agreement "was freely reached by the parties, and that the parties understand the terms of the agreement" with respect to that claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the agency's failure to comply with the OWBPA affects only the appellant's waiver of his age discrimination claim; the appellant's waiver of his other claims remains in effect. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6; 8 (despite its noncompliance with the OWBPA, the settlement agreement remained in effect with respect to the appellant's waiver of all non-age discrimination claims; therefore, the merits of the removal action were not at issue on remand except to the extent that the administrative judge needed to consider them in deciding whether the removal was based on age discrimination); <span class="Italic">Lange,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 371, <span class="Italic">Campo,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (same). Therefore, if the appellant still wishes to pursue his age discrimination claim on remand, further adjudication will be limited to that issue. If the appellant wishes to ratify the waiver, his ratification must comply with the provisions of the OWBPA set forth above.[4] <span class="Italic">See Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc.,</span> 522 U.S. 422, 427-28 (1998) (waiver of an ADEA claim, or ratification of a voidable waiver, is of no effect unless it complies with the OWBPA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although we find that the appellant may continue to pursue his age discrimination claim if he wishes, the appellant has not indicated on review that he wishes to do so. Therefore, we do not remand for further adjudication of the age discrimination claim, but rather for the administrative judge first to discern whether the appellant wishes to pursue that claim. <span class="Italic">Cf. Harris,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 9 (where the appellant s petition for review specifically raised the settlement agreement s noncompliance with the OWBPA, the Board remanded the appeal for adjudication of his age discrimination claim); <span class="Italic">Lange,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 14 (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hinton v. VA</span>, 119 MSPR 129, 133-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 2013 MSPB 5 (2013), determined that the OWBPA waiver was insufficient and remanded a case that was supposedly settled so the AJ could consider the age discrimination claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding that the appellant has not, by her claims on review, established error in the administrative judge's dismissal of her appeal as settled, there remains an issue that merits consideration. The appellant raised an allegation of age discrimination in connection with her removal. The administrative judge issued an affirmative defenses order setting out, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the burden of proof as to age discrimination and directing the appellant to specifically identify the factual basis for her claim. After she failed to respond, the administrative judge issued a second order, affording the appellant additional time to describe her claim in detail. The appellant filed two submissions describing in detail her allegation of age discrimination. Under the circumstances, the record does not support a finding that the appellant waived her age discrimination claim based on her failure to respond to the administrative judge's initial order regarding the appellant's affirmative defenses. In effect, a finding that she did so would be a dismissal for failure to prosecute, a severe sanction that will only be imposed if necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See Wiggins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (2010); <span class="Italic">Simon v. Department of Commerce</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (2009). As set forth above, such a severe action is not supported by the record. Nor do we find that the appellant may be considered to have otherwise voluntarily withdrawn or waived her age discrimination claim.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the settlement agreement, we find that it does not comply with the OWBPA.

<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="Italic">Hinton</span>, as to a preference eligible Postal employee who could simultaneously pursue a grievance and Board appeal, the settlement of a grievance over the removal that did not include an OWPBA waiver did not block the appellant from pursuing the age discrimination claim before the Board, <span class="Italic">Blanding v. USPS</span>, 121 MSPR 248, 251-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-11, 2014 MSPB 43 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a preference-eligible postal employee with at least 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions, the appellant had the right to appeal his removal to the Board under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Gordon-Cureton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). Preference-eligible employees in the U.S. Postal Service, like the appellant, are entitled to simultaneously pursue both a grievance and a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hanna v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8 (2006). However, an appellant may waive his Board appeal rights in the process of settling his grievance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Swidecki v.

The Board will give due effect to the express terms of a valid agreement waiving Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Laity</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 261-62. In addition, an appellant waives his Board appeal rights when a grievance settlement contains a broad and general waiver that encompasses the claim raised before the Board, and does not specifically reserve the right to file an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16; <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 263.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant does not challenge the administrative judge's findings that the grievance settlement did not expressly reserve his Board appeal right, that the agreement effectively waived his right to contest the merits of his removal before the Board, and that he was bound by the agreement reached by union in this matter. Thus, we accept for purposes of our decision that, by virtue of the grievance settlement, the appellant generally waived his right to continue pursuing his pending adverse action appeal with the Board regarding his removal. <span class="Italic">See Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16; <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 263.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues, however, that the grievance settlement did not constitute a valid waiver of his pending age discrimination claim because the agreement did not satisfy the requirements for such a waiver as set forth in the OWBPA. For the following reasons, we agree that the grievance settlement fails to comply with the OWBPA and that the Board therefore retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the pending age discrimination claim, even though the grievance settlement effectively resolved the appellant's other pending claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4788"></span>The OWBPA mandates that a settlement agreement satisfy certain minimum requirements before it may be considered an effective waiver of any right or claim under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1), (f)(2) (concerning waiver of rights under the ADEA); <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Department of Education</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2010) (setting forth the requirements of the OWBPA). The OWBPA applies to the appellant's age discrimination claim, which was raised under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) (making the ADEA applicable to the U.S. Postal Service); <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 12. The record clearly shows that the grievance settlement does not satisfy the requirements of the OWBPA. For instance, the grievance settlement does not specifically refer to a waiver of claims arising under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 12. Nor is there any evidence that the appellant was advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(E); <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, before accepting a settlement agreement in an appeal where age discrimination has been alleged, the Board must first verify that the agency has complied with the waiver requirements in the OWBPA. <span class="Italic">Hinton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 7 (2013); <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 11. In such circumstances, the Board has held that noncompliance with the OWBPA only invalidates the waiver of the age discrimination claim and does not impact an otherwise valid waiver of an appellant's remaining claims, including a challenge to the merits of the underlying appealable adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Hinton</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (the agreement "is still in effect" regarding all but the appellant's age discrimination claim). After invalidating a waiver of a pending age discrimination claim in such circumstances, the Board retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the age discrimination claim as appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Hinton</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6; 8. The question before us is whether that reasoning applies when the Board is considering the impact of a grievance settlement reached while an appellant has a pending adverse action appeal before the Board that includes a claim under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Hinton</span> is instructive, and we extend the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Hinton</span> to this matter. Indeed, there are many similarities between the two cases. For instance, Ms. Hinton, like the appellant, appealed her removal, alleged age discrimination, and subsequently entered into a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Hinton</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 2. The Board in <span class="Italic">Hinton</span> found that, because the settlement agreement did not comply with the OWBPA, Ms. Hinton's waiver of her Board appeal right to challenge her removal was valid, but her age discrimination claim was not waived; thus, only her age discrimination claim should be remanded for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. Such a result is consistent with the well-established principle that the Board's jurisdiction is determined by the nature of an agency's action at the time an appeal is filed with the Board, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Hagan v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 6 (2005); <span class="Italic">Himmel v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 484, 486 (1981), and the Board's retention of jurisdiction to adjudicate discrimination claims even when the underlying appealable action is canceled or rescinded while a Board appeal is pending, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Antonio v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9 (2008). There is no dispute that the appellant's adverse action appeal and attendant age discrimination claim were within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 at the time he filed his appeal. The Board was not divested of jurisdiction over the age discrimination claim because of the subsequent grievance settlement, which did not contain an effective waiver of his ADEA claim as required by the OWBPA.[2] <span class="Italic">See Hinton</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The fact of the appellant's retirement does not render moot his requests for reinstatement and back pay as part of his age discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Paula v. Social Security Administration</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 138, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 11-14 (2013) (finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) does not limit the relief that may be awarded to an appellant who retires based on an agency's final decision to remove him but whose removal is subsequently reversed by the Board). We note that these remedies are available under the ADEA, and the appellant did not receive these remedies as part of his grievance settlement. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we remand the appeal to the Denver Field Office for the administrative judge to adjudicate the appellant's age discrimination claim only. The merits of the removal action are not at issue, except to the extent that the administrative judge needs to address them to decide whether the appellant can prove his affirmative defense of age discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. The appellant claimed below that he was entitled to back pay and reinstatement as part of his age discrimination claim. We note that compensatory damages are not available in an age discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Simonton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 14 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit suggested that if an ADEA waiver is not secured, the ability of the appellant to exercise the right of revocation pertains only to a waiver of any claims under the ADEA, that is, the rest of the settlement remains valid, in <span class="Italic">Schwarz v. FMCS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3040). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. DHS</span>, 95 MSPR 688, 691 &#x00B6; 4 (2004) ("Even assuming that the OWBPA applied in this matter, the failure of the agreement to comply with the OWBPA would not serve as a basis for invalidating the entire agreement. Rather, only the portion of the agreement waiving an age discrimination claim would be nullified."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Lisbon v. VA</span>, AT-0752-12-0215-I-1 (NP 8/6/2013) (parties' oral settlement was not adequately documented by the AJ, the parties disagreed as to whether a subsequent draft written agreement embodied the oral settlement, and the global release called for by the agency would have required application of OWBPA, calling for a written agreement and a revocation period; n.3 allowed for the possibility that, had a settlement been found to exist, the Board could have remanded the case for adjudication of the appellant's age discrimination claim.); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Butler v. FCC</span>, DC-0752-14-0230-I-1 (NP 10/24/2014) ("However, the OWBPA applies only to agreements that settle age discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parker-Allen v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Req. No. 05A30633, 2003 WL 21048353, at *1 (May 2, 2003). The appellant did not raise an age discrimination claim below, and so these arguments are irrelevant. The appellant seems to suggest that the OWBPA applies because the initial decision in this matter was issued before a hearing was held and he is raising an age discrimination claim on review. This is incorrect. The Board will not review claims of affirmative defenses raised for the first time on review, where they are not supported by any new evidence which was unavailable before the record closed below. <span class="Italic">Arndt v. Department of Transportation</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 221, 225 (1983).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The seven-day revocation period is in 29 USC 626(f)(1):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(G)&#x2003;the agreement provides that for a period of at least 7 days following the execution of such agreement, the individual may revoke the agreement, and the agreement shall not become effective or enforceable until the revocation period has expired.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the waiver may be advisable, <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 113 MSPR 601, 607 n.3, 2010 MSPB 93 (2010), explicitly determined that an OWBPA seven-day revocation period is not required in a Board settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge acknowledged that the OWBPA had been implicated, and she afforded the appellant a 7-day revocation period before issuing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(G). Such a revocation period, however, is not required in settlement of a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Lange,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lange v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 94 MSPR 371, 374-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2003), cited in <span class="Italic">Schwartz,</span> stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OWBPA, which is codified in relevant part at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f), amended the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The OWBPA states in section 626(f)(1) that a waiver of an ADEA claim may not be considered "knowing and voluntary" unless, at a minimum, eight conditions are met. Those eight conditions are numbered as subparagraphs (A) through (H) of section 626(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection 626(f)(2) goes on to say that a waiver in a settlement of a charge filed with the EEOC or an action filed with a court may not be considered "knowing and voluntary" unless, at a minimum, subparagraphs (A) through (E) of subsection 626(f)(1) are met, and "the individual is given a reasonable period of time within which to consider the settlement agreement." The EEOC has applied section 626(f)(2) to mixed-case appeals, that is, to Board appeals which involve a claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Campo v. Potter</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03A20012, 2002 WL 31094095 (Aug. 23, 2002). Accordingly, we find that subsection 626(f)(2) of Title 29 applies to settlements of Board cases. Thus, before accepting a settlement of an appeal involving a claim of age discrimination, an AJ should inquire whether subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 626(f)(1) were followed and whether the appellant was given a "reasonable period of time" to consider the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 626(f)(1) state that a waiver of an ADEA claim is knowing and voluntary if</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;the waiver is part of an agreement between the individual and the employer that is written in a manner calculated to be understood by such individual, or by the average individual eligible to participate;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;the waiver specifically refers to rights or claims arising under this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;the individual does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;the individual waives rights or claims only in exchange for consideration in addition to anything of value to which the individual already is entitled; [and]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003;the individual is advised in writing to consult with an attorney prior to executing the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2). Further, the statute provides that in any dispute which may arise over whether any of the above requirements, conditions, and circumstances have been met, the party asserting the validity of <span id="Page_4789"></span>the waiver shall have the burden of proving in a court of competent jurisdiction that a waiver was knowing and voluntary under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f). 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the tape of the parties' settlement agreement is inaudible, we find, based on the initial decision's description of the terms of the settlement agreement, and the agency's mistaken belief on review that the appellant had not raised an age discrimination claim below, that the agreement in this case likely did not, at a minimum, comply with section 626(f)(2)'s requirement that the waiver specifically refer to rights or claims arising under the ADEA. In any event and as noted above, in a dispute over whether the requirements of section 626(f)(2) have been met, the party asserting the validity of the waiver has the burden of proving that the waiver was knowing and voluntary. The agency, which has "rest[ed] on the record," has not satisfied this burden. <span class="Italic">See Campo</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03A20012, 2002 WL 31094095, slip op. at 4 n.6 (where the agency provided no documentation or argument to convince the EEOC that the agency advised the petitioner in writing to consult an attorney before executing the agreement, or gave the petitioner a reasonable amount of time to consider the agreement, the EEOC could not conclude that those OWBPA conditions were satisfied). Thus, we find that the agreement in this case did not comply with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that the settlement agreement did not comply with section 626(f)(2), we turn to the effect of this determination on this appeal. The appellant contends that because he alleged that his removal was based on age discrimination, "the law" permits him to rescind the settlement agreement within seven days. The appellant has not identified which law so provides. We note that subparagraph (G) of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1) provides for a seven-day period in which to revoke a settlement agreement. As explained above, however, only subparagraphs (A) through (E) of section 626(f)(1) apply to settlement agreements in Board appeals. Thus, the agreement here was not defective under the OWBPA in not providing a seven-day revocation period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board applied a practical approach to OWBPA waivers in <span class="Italic">McNeill v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-12-0177-I-1 (NP 2/7/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that the agreement must be overturned because the provisions of the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act (OWBPA), specifically, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(F)-(G), were not met. However, the Board is not bound by these provisions of the OWBPA. <span class="Italic">See Lange v. Department of the Interior</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 11 (2003). Rather, we have previously found that settlements of Board cases are covered by 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(2), which requires compliance only with the criteria set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(A)-(E). <span class="Italic">Lange</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 7. Thus, before accepting a settlement agreement in an appeal where age discrimination has been alleged, the Board must first verify that the agency has complied with the requirements of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626(f)(1)(A)-(E), and the appellant must be given a reasonable period of time within which to consider the agreement. <span class="Italic">Lange</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Review of the settlement agreement at issue here shows that it meets the applicable requirements of the OWBPA. Specifically, it is written in a manner that can be understood by the average individual, explicitly refers to waiver of claims arising under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, does not waive rights or claims that may arise after the date the waiver is executed, affords the appellant consideration (a clean record, a neutral job reference, and a lump sum payment of $25,000.00), and provides that the agency advised the appellant in writing to consult with an attorney prior to entering into the agreement. Furthermore, the appellant was represented during the MAP settlement process. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). There is no indication that the MAP process failed to afford the appellant and his representative a reasonable time to consider the agreement. Also, given that the initial decision dismissing this appeal as settled issued 7 days after the agreement was signed, the appellant had a reasonable period of time within which to reconsider the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties place a cancelation or rescission clause into their settlements based on what they believe to be the requirements of the OWBPA, the clause is enforced if the appellant proves that the preconditions to the cancelation provision were met, <span class="Italic">Ikossi v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from her Electrical Engineer position based on charges of alleged misconduct. The appellant appealed her removal, contending, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that it constituted retaliation for her prior equal employment opportunity activity. During the adjudication of the appeal, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, under which terms the appellant agreed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to withdraw her appeal and resign her position in exchange for the agency's promise to cancel the removal action. In addition, the agreement provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The appellant] may withdraw from this Agreement if Ms. Deschak, of [the agency's] Employee Relations Office, <span class="Italic">receives</span> [the appellant's] written notice canceling the Agreement before 3:00 PM on the seventh day after the Agreement is signed. This Agreement shall be effective seven days after the date of the last signature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant signed the agreement on December 16, 2003.<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 6. The agency's management official signed the agreement on December 17, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 17, 2003, the administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal as withdrawn pursuant to the settlement agreement upon finding that the agreement was lawful on its face, the parties freely entered into it, and they understood its terms. Initial Decision at 1. He entered the agreement into the record for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 22, 2003, the appellant filed a submission with the AJ in which she stated that she wishes to exercise her right to cancel the agreement because, upon further reflection, some of the terms of the agreement were not acceptable. With her submission, the appellant submitted a copy of a letter dated December 22, 2003, addressed to Ms. Deschak, in which the appellant notified the agency that she exercised her right to withdraw from the settlement agreement. The regional office forwarded the appellant's submission to the Clerk of the Board for adjudication as a potential petition for review. The agency has responded in opposition to the appellant's submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that removes an appeal from the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 210 &#x00B6; 5 (2001); <span class="Italic">Wolfe v.

In the absence of unusual circumstances, the Board will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 210 &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Scott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 581 &#x00B6; 7 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant's appeal was withdrawn based on a written settlement agreement. Although the appellant voluntarily agreed to withdraw her appeal based on the settlement agreement, she retained the right to cancel the agreement entirely, including her withdrawal of her appeal, so long as she informed Ms. Deschak in writing by 3:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on the seventh day after December 17, 2003. If the appellant timely informed Ms. Deschak that she wished to cancel the agreement, then under the terms of the agreement itself, the appellant's withdrawal of her appeal is ineffective, and she is entitled to the continued adjudication of her appeal. Under the circumstances, we find it appropriate to consider the appellant's December 22 submission as a request to reopen and reinstate her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Walker</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 210 &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant has submitted a copy of a letter to Ms. Deschak dated December 22, 2003 in which she indicates her intent to cancel the agreement, the appellant has not actually proven that Ms. Deschak received this letter on or before 3:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on December 24, 2003 as required by the agreement. The agency, for its part, does not contend that the appellant did not provide timely notice of her intent to cancel the agreement. Nevertheless, the appellant's evidence that she prepared appropriate written notice is not sufficient to prove that she sent the notice or that the notice was received in accordance with the settlement agreement. She has not, however, been informed of what she must show to meet her burden of proving that she canceled her consent to the settlement agreement in accordance with its terms. Under the unique circumstances of this case we find that the appellant is entitled to the opportunity to prove that she timely canceled the settlement agreement. We also find that it is appropriate to remand this appeal to the regional office and direct the AJ to take evidence and argument as to whether the agreement has been properly canceled. <span class="Italic">Cf. Garrison v. Department of the Navy</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 389 &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (the AJ is in the best position to determine whether the agency met its burden of proving that it would have removed the appellant in the absence of prohibited discrimination and to hold any additional hearing that may be required).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the parties appear to believe that the cancellation clause was required by law because the appellant initially raised a claim of age discrimination in connection with her appeal. In fact, however, the cancellation clause was not required. <span class="Italic">Lange v. Department of the Interior</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 371 &#x00B6; 11 (2003), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 87 Fed. Appx. 172 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Nevertheless, the parties bargained for the cancellation clause and included it in the agreement. So long as the appellant complied with the procedures contained in the cancellation clause, it is enforceable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarosz v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 107 MSPR 281, 2007 MSPB 275 (2007) (reopening appeal through PFR when the appellant timely invoked an OWBPA provision in a settlement to rescind the agreement that had resulted in an initial decision dismissing his appeal as withdrawn).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 94 MSPR 669, 674-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (2003), applied the OWBPA to permit rescission of an agreement within the seven-day review period. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> considered the sufficiency and timing of the revocation notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the terms of the agreement, "within 7 days of signing and delivering this Agreement, Appellant may revoke it by delivering a written notice of revocation to the EEO Specialist [Carr]." The appellant signed the agreement on May 21, and on May 28 sent a letter by facsimile to the administrative judge and the agency representative, stating that she was revoking the agreement. That letter included EEO Specialist Carr as an addressee, and he apparently works at the same location as the <span id="Page_4790"></span>agency representative. The appellant also certified that she mailed the May 28 letter to the administrative judge, the agency representative, and Carr on May 28. The agency has not challenged that certification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that mailing the revocation to Carr on the last day to revoke satisfies the requirements of the settlement agreement. The written agreement does not specify the manner of delivery of the written notice of revocation to Carr. Had the agency, whose representative drafted the agreement, intended for "delivery" to mean "personal delivery" or "receipt," it could have drafted the settlement agreement to so state<span class="Italic">. See Bables v. Department of the Army,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 171 &#x00B6; 14 (2000) (where there is a latent ambiguity, courts construe the ambiguous term against the drafter of the contract, if the nondrafter's interpretation is reasonable). We find that the appellant's interpretation that mailing the revocation letter on the last day was a sufficient method of delivery is reasonable, particularly in view of the Board's regulation providing that documents may be served by mail, facsimile, personal delivery, and overnight commercial delivery. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(i); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.604(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued that the 7-day period had expired when the appellant transmitted her May 28 letter by facsimile at 2:51 <span class="small">P.M.</span> because she had executed the agreement no later than 2:20 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on May 21. We find no merit to this argument. The Board's practice is to count days as full calendar days, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(h), and the agency has not provided any legal support for its alternative method of measuring the time. If the agency had intended that the 7-day period was to be calculated in such fashion, it could have drafted the settlement agreement to include that term. We find that the appellant exercised her right to revoke the agreement before the expiration of the 7-day period. Thus, the appeal should not have been dismissed as settled, and we must remand this appeal for adjudication on the merits of the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we have given effect to the appellant's revocation, there is no settlement agreement to enforce. Therefore, we need not address her allegations that the agency breached the agreement, and we VACATE the initial decision regarding compliance and DISMISS the petition for enforcement in MSPB Docket No. SF-0752-02-0217-C-1.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 123 MSPR 178, 180-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-12, 2016 MSPB 4 (2016), permitted rescission when the appellant timely notified the agency of the revocation after the initial decision was issued dismissing the appeal. The revocation clause was unlimited and, having been placed into the settlement, it was immaterial that age discrimination was not raised in the underlying appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the pendency of the appeals, on August 7, 2015, the parties reached a settlement agreement. The agreement provided that the agency would take several actions in the appellant's favor, including expunging the Standard Form 50 reflecting a removal for unacceptable performance, replacing it with one reflecting a removal for failure to accept a directed reassignment, and providing her a neutral reference. In return, the appellant would, among other things, withdraw her Board appeal. The agreement also provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]n accordance with the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA), Appellant acknowledges...she has seven (7) days from the execution date (date of her signing this Agreement) to revoke this Agreement, this Agreement will not become effective or enforceable until that revocation period has expired, and the 7-day period for revocation is a reasonable time for the appellant to consider whether to allow this Agreement to become effective and binding on both parties or to notify the Agency representative in writing of any revocation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal as settled on August 13, 2015--1 day before the close of the revocation period. Later that day, however, the appellant informed the agency's representative via email that she was revoking the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In construing a settlement agreement, the Board "assign[s] to words their ordinary and commonly accepted meaning unless it is shown that the parties intended otherwise." <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In this case, it appears to us that the provision of the agreement allowing for revocation within 7 days is quite plain. The agency, however, argues that the provision does not allow the appellant to revoke the agreement, or at least not the entire agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the agency argues that the appellant did not raise any claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and, in any event, the OWBPA does not require the 7-day revocation period in a settlement of a Board appeal even if age discrimination is raised. <span class="Italic">See Lange v. Department of the Interior</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8, 11 (2003) (holding that the OWPBA requirement for a 7-day revocation period does not apply to Board appeals). Thus, the agency argues that the provisions pertaining to the OWBPA were not material to the settlement agreement, and therefore were severable from the rest of the agreement. The agency further argues that the revocation clause should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to any ADEA claims that were encompassed in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its argument regarding the narrow scope of the revocation clause, the agency cites to <span class="Italic">Hinton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 9 (2013), and <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Department of Education</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2010), in which the Board only remanded the appellants' age discrimination claims when the settlement agreements in those appeals failed to comply with the OWBPA and the appellants sought to set aside the agreements on review. The Board found that the appellants' waiver of their other claims remained in effect. <span class="Italic">Hinton</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span> and <span class="Italic">Hinton</span> are not instructive in this situation. Unlike the present appeal, it does not appear that the settlement agreements at issue in those decisions included a 7-day revocation period, and there was, therefore, no attempt to invoke a revocation provision. <span class="Italic">See generally Hinton</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 7-10 (rejecting the appellant's challenge to the validity of the settlement agreement, but remanding the appellant's age discrimination claim because the agreement failed to comply with OWBPA requirements applicable to Board appeals); <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-14 (same). The settlement agreement in this appeal, however, includes a revocation provision to which both parties agreed, and it is this provision that is dispositive to the outcome of this petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that it is irrelevant whether the OWBPA requires a 7-day revocation period, because the settlement agreement provides for one. In addition, the fact that the OWBPA did not require the inclusion of a revocation provision does not mean that the provision was immaterial. Rather, the appellant chose to invoke the revocation period, suggesting that it was material to her decision to sign the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find unpersuasive the agency's argument that the settlement agreement here contains a severability clause that permits the revocation provision to be severed, thus furthering the public policy goal of enforcing the settlement agreement against all of the appellant's non-ADEA claims.[2] We find that the severability of this provision is not supported by the plain language of the settlement agreement. The revocation provision does not specify that the appellant had 7 days to revoke her settlement of any ADEA claims; it instead provides, without qualification, that she had 7 days "to revoke this Agreement." Furthermore, the severability clause provides that any nonmaterial term or condition of the agreement may be severed "[i]n the event that [it] is determined by a court or administrative entity...to be unenforceable as a matter of law." The revocation provision is not unenforceable, and therefore does not fall under the coverage of the severability clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency also argues that the U.S. Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc.,</span> 522 U.S. 422 (1998), that ADEA and non-ADEA claims may be severable in the context of a settlement agreement. The Court found in Oubre that a release of claims that did not comply with the OWBPA was not enforceable as to age claims. 522 U.S. at 427-28. The Court recognized that instances may arise where such a release was effective as to other types of claims; however, it declined to explore the issue further. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 428. In any event, because the release at issue in <span class="Italic">Oubre</span> did not contain a revocation provision, we find that it is not analogous to the situation presented here. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 424-25 (observing that the release did not provide the employee with 7 days "to change her mind"). Here, the agreement provided for revocation and the appellant timely revoked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although we agree with the agency that public policy favors settlement agreements, <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Department of the Interior</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 195, 197-98 (1984), the law does not permit the Board to rewrite unilaterally the clear, unambiguous, and lawful terms of a settlement agreement against the wishes of a party. <span class="Italic">See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560 (finding that the Board erred in interpreting a settlement agreement contrary to its clear and unambiguous terms).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. DHS</span>, DC-0752-14-0243-I-1 (NP 6/23/2016) ("In construing a contract, we look first to the terms of the agreement itself. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The agency may have intended for the revocation period to only apply if the appellant claimed that he had been discriminated against based on age, but the settlement agreement does not set any such limit, and the Board cannot add it after the fact. Only if there is some ambiguity should parol evidence be considered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is no ambiguity in the terms of this agreement. The fact that the OWBPA only requires a 7-day revocation period in agreements settling claims brought under the ADEA is irrelevant because the settlement agreement at issue includes a 7-day revocation period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (2016).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ammons v. VA,</span> SF-0752-09-0897-C-1 (NP 5/24/2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Ammons v. VA</span>, 476 Fed. Appx. 270 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP)), declined to permit rescission of an <span id="Page_4791"></span>agreement based on OWBPA rights untimely invoked based on the appellant's protest that she did not invoke the rescission in time because she did not have a copy of the settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserts that she could not act within the 7-day time frame allowed to revoke the settlement agreement because neither she nor her representative received a copy of the agreement, and that she would have revoked the agreement if she had been given a chance to read it "in a different setting and found it[ ] s content in dispute with what [she was] hoping to achieve." The appellant is basically asserting that she failed to understand the import of the settlement agreement that she signed or that she changed her mind. She has not asserted that she requested a copy of the settlement agreement to review after she signed it. Again, her or her representative's unilateral mistake as to the scope of the settlement agreement does not provide a basis for invalidating it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7. In that regard, we note that the agreement stated that it "constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties and there are no other terms or commitments, oral or written"; that it "may not be modified except by a writing signed by all of the Parties"; that "[t]he Parties have entered into this Agreement freely and voluntarily"; and that [t]he Appellant has thoroughly reviewed the entire Agreement and understands its provisions." In addition, both the appellant and her representative signed the agreement. Given this, the appellant has provided no basis for finding that the settlement agreement was invalid or that she lacked an opportunity to review it before the administrative judge issued the initial decision dismissing her appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ziegler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 116 MSPR 514, 516-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2011 MSPB 66 (2011), determined that an appellant can challenge an OWBPA waiver without tendering back what was received through a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, because a settlement agreement is a contract, claims of breach must be adjudicated in accordance with contract law. <span class="Italic">See Greco</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). That is not the case, however, with respect to a waiver of rights and claims under the ADEA. The OWBPA sets up its own regime for assessing the effect of ADEA waivers, separate and apart from contract law. <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc</span>., 522 U.S. 422, 427 (1998). The OWBPA governs the effect under federal law of waivers or releases on ADEA claims and incorporates no exceptions or qualifications. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, we agree with the appellant that the administrative judge erred by applying general contract law in reaching his determination that the appellant breached the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to EEOC regulations, an employee has the right to challenge the validity of an ADEA waiver agreement. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1625.23(b). Section 1625.23(b) states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No ADEA waiver agreement, covenant not to sue, or other equivalent arrangement may impose any condition precedent, any penalty, or any other limitation adversely affecting any individual's right to challenge the agreement. This prohibition includes but is not limited to provisions requiring employees to tender back consideration received, and provisions allowing employers to recover attorney's fees and/or damages because of the filing of an ADEA suit. This rule is not intended to preclude employers from recovering attorney's fees or costs specifically authorized under federal law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, "an employee may waive claims and covenant not to bring suit on any claims under the ADEA, but cannot surrender the right to challenge the <span class="Italic">validity</span> of the waiver or covenant." <span class="Italic">Ridinger v. Dow Jones &#x0026; Co., Inc.</span>, 717 F. Supp.2d 369, 371 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (emphasis in original). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1625.22(i) (prohibiting waiver provisions that preclude an individual from filing a charge or complaint, including a challenge to the validity of the ADEA waiver itself). Moreover, an employee cannot be required to tender back the consideration he received as a condition to exercise that right. <span class="Italic">See Ridinger</span>, 717 F. Supp.2d at 371 (employer cannot condition the right to challenge waiver on the return of any consideration previously received or the payment of attorney's fees if the employee is unsuccessful). We conclude that the appellant was within his rights in seeking to challenge the validity of the ADEA waiver before the EEOC, and he was not obligated to tender back the consideration he was paid in order to do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Pucek v. DOD</span>, CH-315H-14-0147-I-1 (NP 10/20/2014), placed some reliance on failure to tender back benefits received as evidence that an appellant did not revoke an agreement under the OWBPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the appellant retained employment with the agency and he received back pay. His failure to show that he is willing to return the back pay and rescind his employment agreement with the agency undermines his revocation claim.[4] <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 135, 138 (1995) (noting that an appellant's claim of coercion was undermined where she did not indicate that she was willing to return the back pay and benefits she received under the settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;"The continued acceptance of benefits under the contract is the most common and clearest case of election by conduct." <span class="Italic">Cities Service Helex, Inc. v. United States</span>, 543 F.2d 1306, 1314 (Ct. Cl. 1976).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-062.html#sec16-62">Restoration of Consideration Received; 'Tender Back.</a>'"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By reason of the appellant's ability to rescind a settlement under OWBPA, an AJ should not dismiss an appeal as settled before the expiration of a contractual seven-day revocation period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 94 MSPR 669, 673-74 &#x00B6; 6 (2003); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Remple v. DHHS</span>, 395 Fed. Appx. 676, 679 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (appellant suffered no harm when the AJ issue the initial decision on the last day the appellant could exercise her OWBPA revocation option). If an appellant revokes a settlement under OWBPA, the appellant can rescind the revocation. Then, any attempt to set the agreement aside would be based on the basis of fraud or mutual mistake or other traditional basis for rescission of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/HALL_STEVEN_H_DC_0752_14_0243_I_1_FINAL_ORDER_1312121.pdf">DC-0752-14-0243-I-1</a> (NP 6/23/2016) ("The initial decision notes that the appellant timely requested to revoke the settlement agreement and subsequently rescinded the revocation.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant comes to the Board through an IRA appeal and that appeal is dismissed based on a settlement, the failure of the settlement to adhere to the OWBPA does not establish jurisdiction if the employee, a program officer with the Foreign Service, would not have an adverse action appeal right and the right to join to the adverse action appeal an ADEA or other EEO defense and claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Winters v.
