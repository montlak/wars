<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-289"><span class="space">d.</span> Hours, Days of Duty; Schedule Adjustments; Flexible or Compressed Schedules; AWS; Credit Hours</h5>
<p class="noindent">Before the 1990 <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. </span>decision [37 FLRA 309], establishing an "abrogation" standard (and the decision again establishing an "abrogation standard," <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-28.html">5 FLRA 113</a> (2010), and the decision reinstating the excessive interference standard, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018)), FLRA's approach to arbitration awards restricting management's assignment of work or hours of work was summarized in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Birmingham and AFGE Local 2207</span>, 34 FLRA 335, 340 (1990), negating an award that determined management violated an agreement by assigning extra hours of work to part-time employees before scheduling overtime for full-time employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that an arbitrator may not enforce a collective bargaining agreement so as to infringe on the exercise of a management right....&#8197;Agreement provisions that would prohibit management from reassigning an employee unless the employee consents interfere with management's right to assign employees....&#8197;Here, the Arbitrator has directed that management may not assign extra hours of work to part-time employees without their consent. By conditioning the assignment of extra work on employee consent, the Arbitrator has issued an award that conflicts with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award improperly precluded management from assigning employees to work during midweek holidays. Although the arbitrator found a past practice to support his award, FLRA concluded the award violated the preclusion against a restriction that would affect the authority of management to assign work. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-25 and Brockton/West Roxbury VAMC</span>, 21 FLRA 83, 85 (1986). For the same reason, an award could not direct management to return to a past practice of granting employees every other weekend off. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Leavenworth and AFGE Local 85</span>, 30 FLRA 386, 387-88 (1987). An award interfered with the right of management to assign work that precluded, as inequitable, the practice of assigning certain on-call duties to physicians working at a medical center if the same duties were not assigned to physicians working at a related clinic. <span class="Italic">VA Hosp., Lebanon and AFGE Local 1966</span>, 11 FLRA 193, 194 (1983). An award was vacated that required management to relinquish its right to refuse to permit shift exchanges of female employees required to perform searches of civilians. The arbitrator's award, predicated on a belief that management could manage the shift problem through other means, intruded on management's right to determine the qualifications of employees for the positions filled. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Laredo and NTEU Chap. 145</span>, 17 FLRA 68, 69 (1985). An award could not properly require that training be provided to employees on their regular night tour of duty rather than on the day shift. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lebanon and AFGE Local 1966</span>, 19 FLRA 392, 393 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award that essentially allowed an arbitrator to make a determination of the employees whose presence during inclement whether was essential to agency operations was set aside. It excessively interfered with management's right to assign work, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Womack Army Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1770</span>, <span class="blue">60 FLRA 721</span>, 725-26 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a) and excessively interferes with its right to assign work and determine the personnel by which Agency operations shall be conducted. The Authority reviews questions of law <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When resolving an exception alleging that an award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Small Bus. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If it does, then the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-53 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Food &#x0026; Drug Admin., Detroit Dist.</span>, 59 FLRA 679, 682 (2004). The Arbitrator ordered the Agency to rescind the designations of path lab employees and phlebotomists as adverse weather essential. By doing so, the award affects the Agency's right to determine when work assignments will occur and to whom the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As such, the award affects the Agency's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon finding that an award affects a management right, the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 152-53. Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a provision in the agreement that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 153. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the law or provision in the agreement at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154. An award that fails to satisfy either prong I or prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority considers whether Article XVII, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, constitutes either an appropriate arrangement or a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr., Oklahoma City, Okla.</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 110 (2002); <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 152-53. The Agency argues that the award excessively interferes with its right to assign work and to determine the personnel by which work will be accomplished. Therefore, we confine the discussion to the Agency's arguments. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Augusta, Ga.</span>, 59 FLRA 780 (2004). A provision excessively interferes with a management right <span id="page_2255"></span>if the benefits afforded employees under the provision are outweighed by the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">BOP Oklahoma City</span>, 58 FLRA at 111.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency argues that the burden of not being able to assign employees it deems critical to work during adverse weather outweighs the benefit to employees of not being designated adverse weather essential. The Agency argues that the benefit to the employees is not being required to work during adverse weather.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By ordering the Agency to cancel its designation of the path lab employees and the phlebotomists as adverse weather essential, the award overturns the Agency's substantive determination that these employees are critical to the operation of its medical center and prevents management from determining the particular duties to be assigned and when work assignments will be performed. The award operates to prevent the Agency from assigning any path lab or phlebotomists to staff the lab during periods of adverse weather. Moreover, management's inability to assign lab work to lab personnel would require the Agency to assign those duties to other employees. This is a significant burden on the Agency's ability to exercise its right to assign work. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Serv., San Diego, Cal.</span>, 51 FLRA 1094, 1101 (1996) (<span class="Italic">DOJ, San Diego</span>) ("[The] Authority has long held that attempts to preclude the assignment of work on particular days of the week are inconsistent with the right to assign work."); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 85</span>, 32 FLRA 210, 216 (1988) (A proposal precluding an agency from determining when duties would be performed found nonnegotiable as it prevented the agency from exercising its right to assign work.).<span class="Italic"> See also IFPTE, Local 1</span>, 49 FLRA 225, 249 (1994) (proposal that acted as an absolute restriction on the right to assign particular duties to certain employees found to excessively interfere with management's rights); <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 26</span>, 22 FLRA 314, 325 (1986) (proposals that could have the effect of completely abrogating the agency's right to assign a particular employee to perform a particular job excessively interfered with management's right to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency acknowledges that the benefit to employees is not having to travel in adverse weather conditions, this benefit is reduced by the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency provides safe transportation to employees during inclement weather.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator interpreted the parties' agreement in such a way as to completely prevent the Agency from assigning work to path lab employees and phlebotomists during times of adverse weather, and the benefit to employees of not having to travel during adverse weather is reduced by the Agency providing transportation, we find that the benefit to the employees is outweighed by the burden on the Agency. Therefore, the award excessively interferes with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, San Diego</span>, 52 FLRA at 1101;<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 85</span>, 32 FLRA at 216.<span class="Italic"> </span>Therefore, we set aside the award as it fails to satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another award was vacated because the arbitrator compelled management to schedule part-time employees for 24 rather than 20 hours of work per week. Management's determination of the number of hours to schedule for a part-time career employee is encompassed within its right to assign work. <span class="Italic">VARO and AFGE Local 1765</span>, 30 FLRA 3, 5 (1987). Because an employee may only receive pay and benefits of his appointed position, lacking an award of a retroactive appointment, an arbitrator could not direct full-time benefits and compensation for employees appointed to part-time positions. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 2805</span>, 18 FLRA 317, 318 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to claims for additional hours of duty, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2654 and VAMC, Fresno</span>, 27 FLRA 143, 144-45 (1987), involved a complaint by a part-time VA physician that, after his request for additional hours of work was turned down for budgetary reasons, the VA hired another part-time physician. The grievance requested a back pay remedy. FLRA reversed an arbitrator's determination that the grievance was not arbitrable because it involved an appointment to a position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e agree with the Union that the grievance only indirectly concerns the appointment of the temporary physician. The grievance challenges management's denial of the grievant's request for additional hours by claiming that the appointment of the other physician indicates that the stated basis for the denial was pretextual and by claiming that the Activity acted improperly in denying the request. The grievance does not directly challenge the appointment of the other physician and the requested remedy in no manner concerns that appointment. Accordingly, we conclude that the grievance does not concern an appointment within the meaning of section 7121(c)(4) and that the Arbitrator's determination to the contrary is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with the Union that the grievance is not precluded by management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(B) to determine the personnel by which agency operations will be conducted. This determination by the Arbitrator was in conjunction with his view that the grievance directly challenged the appointment of the other physician and correspondingly constituted a direct challenge to management's right....&#8197;As stated above, we find instead that the grievance challenges management's denial of the grievant's request for additional hours. It does not directly challenge the appointment of the other physician and only concerns that appointment for the purpose of claiming that the stated basis for the denial was pretextual....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Arbitrator's determinations that the grievant had no claim to additional hours of work and that the Activity was at liberty to place anyone on the payroll are not determinations relating to whether the grievance is grievable and arbitrable, but rather to whether the grievance has merit....</p>
<p class="noindent">As to alternative work schedule arrangements, <span class="Italic">DHHS, FDA and NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 528, 529 (2003), described the scope of permissible grievances:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award violates management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. Because the Agency's exception challenges the award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews the questions of law raised in the exception and the arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo. See, e.g., NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1709 (1998).

In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 50</span>, 54 FLRA 250, 253 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's award enforcing a contractual provision pertaining to the implementation or administration of an AWS program is enforceable under the Statute, notwithstanding an exception claiming that the award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 131, 135 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Labor</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring as to result). Citing <span class="Italic">NTEU, Atlanta, Ga.</span>, 32 FLRA 879 (1988), the Agency argues that this principle does not apply to the instant case because the award does not concern the implementation or administration of an AWS program. The Agency's argument is not convincing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency's call-in requirement was inconsistent with the flexible bands and the tardiness policies established in the parties' collective bargaining agreement for employees on alternate work schedules. Clearly, therefore, the award enforces a contractual provision that concerns the implementation and administration of the parties' AWS program. As such, the award is enforceable notwithstanding management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Labor</span>, 59 FLRA at 135. Having reached this result, it is unnecessary to address the parties' contentions regarding management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was sustained that held management to a contract clause setting parameters for schedule adjustments. The award did not infringe the agency's right to establish internal security, and the award did not violate management's right to assign work, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAIL Local 19</span>, 72 FLRA 526, 530–31 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring):</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The first question is whether the Arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision,[51] and because the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 52, Section 10, the answer to the first question is yes. The second question is whether the remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the contract violation.[52] The Authority has held that a backpay remedy for employees who lost compensation due to a contract-violating schedule change reasonably and proportionally related to that contract violation.[53] Applying that previous holding to the backpay remedy here, the answer to the second question is yes.</p>

<p class="noindent">Exceptions to awards concerning flexible schedules will ordinarily be resolved under provisions of the negotiated agreement rather than under the Work Schedules Act, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1709 and Dept. of Air Force, Dover AFB</span>, 57 FLRA 711, 712-13 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's claim that the award violates &#x00A7; 6131 of the Act [5 USC 6101 note] is misplaced. Section 6131 states that if an agency finds that a particular flexible or compressed schedule has had or would have an adverse agency impact, the agency shall either decide not to establish that schedule or discontinue its use.[2] <span class="Italic">That is, by its</span> <span class="Italic">terms, &#x00A7; 6131 applies to actions establishing and discontinuing schedules. </span>Nothing in &#x00A7; 6131 supports a conclusion that it applies to a situation like that in the instant case, where an AWS schedule itself is not discontinued but, instead, its applicability to one employee is at issue.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Under a flexible schedule, an employee may elect different starting and quitting times from a fixed schedule; under a compressed schedule, an employee may work an 80-hour pay period in less than 10 workdays. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6122(a) and 6121(5)(A), respectively. This case involves only a flexible schedule, since the Agency denied the grievant's request to continue to have starting and quitting times different from the norm.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Insofar as the Authority's construction of &#x00A7; 6131 in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1709</span>, 57 FLRA 453 (2001), differs from that here, that aspect of <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1709 </span>will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the award does not involve discontinuation of a schedule and involves only the application of a flexible schedule, the relevant provision of the Act to the circumstances here is &#x00A7; 6122(b). Although not raised by the parties, we take this opportunity to address the applicability of &#x00A7; 6122 to the matter before us.[4] Under that provision, "subject to the terms of any written agreement" between the parties, an agency may restrict an employee's choice of arrival and departure times or exclude the employee from a flexible schedule like the one in this case if the agency determines that the organization in which the employee works "is being substantially disrupted in carrying out its functions or is incurring additional costs because of" the organization's participation in the flexible schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;We note that &#x00A7; 6122(b) would not apply in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local</span> 1709, because that case involved a compressed work schedule, and &#x00A7; 6122 applies only to flexible schedules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 6122(b), therefore, an agency's decision to deny an employee's request to continue to work a flexible schedule is expressly "subject to the terms" of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Since by its terms &#x00A7; 6122(b) makes the standard to be met by an agency subject to the terms of a written agreement, an arbitrator properly looks to the agreement to determine whether an agency has met its obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 67 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 64 FLRA 65, 68 (2009) (arbitration: &#x00A7; 6130(a)(2) prohibits employees represented by union from participating in CWS program unless it is provided under parties' agreement; if agreement did not include particular work unit in existing CWS coverage, it was not violation of law or agreement for management to exclude those employees from CWS coverage extended to other employees).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator properly applied provisions of law governing when an agency can modify a compressed work schedule, <span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 67 FLRA 311, 312-14 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency established an adverse agency impact is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6103 and 6131.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 6103(b)(2) designates the days on which in-lieu-of holidays generally must be scheduled. But &#x00A7; 6103(d)(2) provides that, "notwithstanding any other provision of law or the terms of any collective[-]bargaining agreement," an agency may schedule the in-lieu-of holiday on a different day (within certain limitations not at issue here) "if the agency head determines that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent an adverse agency impact." For these purposes, "adverse agency impact" has the meaning set forth in &#x00A7; 6131(b), which (as relevant here) is "an increase in the cost of agency operations (other than a reasonable administrative cost relating to the process of establishing a flexible or compressed work schedule)."[25]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 6131(b); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 1709</span>, 57 FLRA 453, 456 (2001); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Educ</span>., 45 FLRA 1144, 1150 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, the Agency was required to show that the policy was necessary to prevent <span class="Italic">an increase</span> in costs. The Union notes that compressed work schedules have been in effect at the Agency for at least twenty years, with no change, and claims that this indicates that there is no adverse agency impact. To support its arguments, the Union cites the Federal Service Impasses Panel's (the Panel's) decision in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Federal BOP, U.S. Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa</span>. (<span class="Italic">BOP</span>).[29]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[29]&#x2003;5 FSIP 89 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 6103(d)(2) and 6131(b)(3), read together, allow agencies to change in-lieu-of holidays when necessary to "prevent" an "increase in the cost of agency operations." Nothing in this wording precludes the Agency from relying on the projected costs of continuing the disputed practice. That is, the wording does not preclude the Agency from (1) determining that continuing the practice would "increase" the Agency's costs relative to what those costs would be if the practice ended, and (2) deciding that it was necessary to end the practice in order to "prevent" that increase in costs. As a result, that the disputed practice existed for a long period of time did not preclude the Agency from discontinuing the practice based on the costs that the Agency would incur if it <span class="Italic">continued</span> the practice. As for the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">BOP</span>, in that decision, the Panel relied on many factors--including the agency's use of outdated data and the fact that the cost of a compressed work schedule "appear[ed] to be negligible"--to find that the agency should not have terminated a compressed work schedule.[34] In making that finding, the Panel stated that the agency "should have...anticipated" certain costs before it implemented the compressed work schedule. Even assuming that BOP is relevant in this case--which does not involve termination of compressed work schedules--<span class="Italic">BOP</span> did not hold that agencies may not consider the projected, continuing costs of an existing program when assessing adverse agency impact.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;5 FSIP 89 at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union asserts that, in order to show adverse agency impact, the Agency was required to demonstrate an increase in costs "related to" either: (1) the implementation of the compressed work schedule; or (2) the scheduling of the in-lieu-of holidays. And the Union asserts that the costs of the disputed practice are "negligible and well within a reasonable administrative cost relating to establishing a compressed work schedule."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 6103(d)(2) and 6131(b)(3) neither set forth how agencies must calculate adverse agency impact nor establish a threshold cost level <span id="page_2257"></span>necessary to establish an adverse agency impact. And the Union provides no support for its claims regarding how the Agency was required to calculate that impact. The Union also provides no support for its claim that these amounts were within reasonable administrative costs relative to establishing a compressed work schedule. Thus, the Union's assertions provide no basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Union argues that the Arbitrator erroneously put the burden of proof on the Union by stating that the Union "gave no detailed explanation" for some of its proposed offsets. According to the Union, this is inconsistent with burdens in Panel proceedings involving the termination of compressed work schedules where agencies--not unions--have the burden of establishing adverse agency impact. The Union also argues that a Union witness did, in fact, provide a "detailed analysis" of many of the proposed offsets, and that--contrary to the "totality[-]of[-]the[-]evidence" standard that the Panel applies--the Arbitrator ignored the totality of the evidence in determining that the Agency established adverse agency impact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union correctly notes, in Panel proceedings involving agency terminations of compressed work schedules, agencies have the burden of establishing adverse agency impact.[46] But even assuming that this burden applies in cases like this one that do not involve terminations of compressed work schedules, the Union's arguments provide no basis for finding the Arbitrator's award contrary to law. The Panel has held that it "is not to apply an overly rigorous evidentiary standard, but must determine whether an employer has met its statutory burden on the basis of the totality of the evidence presented."[47]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, &#x00A7; 6131(b)(3) does not prescribe how the Agency was required to calculate the costs of continuing the disputed practice. So there is no basis for finding that the Agency had the burden to calculate all of the offsets that the Union asserted. As a result, when the Arbitrator said that the Union did not give a detailed explanation for those asserted offsets, he did not improperly shift any legal burden that the Agency had. With respect to the Union's claim that it did provide a "detailed analysis" of offsets, the Union neither cites the amounts that it calculated nor explains how the reductions that the Arbitrator did make are inconsistent with those offsets. Finally, as for the Union's claim that the Arbitrator ignored the totality of evidence, he did consider the evidence that the Union cites, including evidence that the Power Administration's sales assist in funding the operation and maintenance of the Agency's facilities, and that the number of operators has not increased since the Power Administration began directly funding the Agency's operations. But the Union provides no basis for finding that these factors are relevant to an assessment of adverse agency impact in this case. Thus, the Union provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law in this regard.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award is contrary to the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982 (Work Schedules Act). Specifically, the Agency asserts that it has the authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6122(a) (&#x00A7; 6122(a)) to make adjustments in the arrival and departure times of employees who work on flexible schedules in order to provide coverage during the hours that offices are open. Citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6131(a), the Agency further asserts that when, as here, there is an adverse agency impact, an agency must discontinue an alternative work schedule, notify the union of the change, and bargain the matter to impasse. The Agency claims that it was required to adjust the grievants' start times so they would have work to do.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 6122(a) of the Work Schedules Act and &#x00A7; 7101 of the Statute. As the Agency's exceptions concern whether the award is contrary to law, the Authority's review is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995).

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Work Schedules Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-established that, under the Work Schedules Act, matters pertaining to alternative work schedules for unit employees are fully negotiable and enforceable, subject only to the Work Schedules Act itself or other laws superseding it.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2361</span>, 57 FLRA 766, 767 (2002).

<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 6122(a), employees' elections of arrival and departure times under a flexible schedule are "subject to limitations generally prescribed to ensure that the duties and requirements of the employee's position are fulfilled." This section permits an agency to make adjustments in the arrival and departure times of individual employees on flexible schedules within already established flexible bands. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Accounting &#x0026; Fin.

Ctr., Denver, Colo.</span>, 42 FLRA 1196, 1205-06 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>). However, an agency's right under<span class="Italic"> </span>&#x00A7; 6122(a) does not encompass changes to flexible bands (i.e., the beginning and ending times) themselves. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, 416 CSG, Griffis Air Force Base, Rome, N.Y.</span>, 38 FLRA 1136, 1148 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Griffis</span>).<span class="Italic"> </span>Changes in flexible bands must be made under &#x00A7; 6122(b), which requires that an agency act "subject to the terms of [the parties'] agreement," and that an agency head determine that the agency "is being substantially disrupted in carrying out its functions or is incurring additional costs." <span class="Italic">See Griffis</span>, 38 FLRA at 1148. As noted above, <span class="Italic">see</span> n.8, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Agency does not argue that the Agency head made a determination under, or that the award is inconsistent with, &#x00A7; 6122(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency did not adjust employees' individual arrival times within already established flexible bands. Rather, the Agency changed the flexible bands during which employees could choose to start the workday. Thus, the changes made by the Agency do not fall within its rights under &#x00A7; 6122(a). <span class="Italic">See Griffis</span>, 38 FLRA at 1148.

<p class="noindent-1">A grievance was filed asserting that the Agency's decision to change the grievant's shift with less than 7 days' advance notice violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; <span id="page_2258"></span>6101(a)(3) and the parties' collective bargaining agreement. As a remedy, the grievant sought 5 hours' overtime pay. The Arbitrator determined that the grievant's supervisor did not improperly change the grievant's shift and denied the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his supplemental award, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's supervisor had "credibly testified" that he had determined "that absent the change to the schedule..., the operations of the Brownsville W[eather] S[ervice] O[ffice] would have been seriously handicapped." Additionally, the Arbitrator concluded that there was sufficient evidence of record for him "to make a finding that the [Agency's] operations at the Brownsville WSO would have been seriously handicapped if the [grievant's supervisor] had not altered the [g]rievant's schedule."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3), employees must be provided with 7 days' advance notice of their work schedules except when the head of an agency determines "that his organization would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased[.]" Although this provision refers to effects on an agency head's "organization," nothing in the provision, or implementing regulations, indicates that such reference means that the exceptions to the 7-day notice apply only based on consideration of the effects on an agency as a whole. We note, in this regard, that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.102(e), promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) pursuant to its authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(c), provides that the authority to establish employee work schedules may be delegated by agency heads to lower-level officials. In our view, it is reasonable to conclude that agency officials who have been delegated authority to establish work schedules for a particular organizational segment also have authority to make changes in those schedules based on consideration of the effects of schedules on that segment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we find that the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Gahagan</span> [<span class="Italic">Gahagan v. United States</span>, 19 Cl. Ct. 168 (1989)] is misplaced. As relevant here, <span class="Italic">Gahagan</span> concerned a challenge to an NWS-wide policy requiring the rescheduling of NWS employees, without regard to the 7-day notice requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101, when necessary to minimize the payment of holiday premium pay. The court found that the policy violated section 6101 because there was no evidence that the Director of the NWS had "made a determination about serious handicaps or substantial costs." <span class="Italic">Gahagan</span>, 19 Cl. Ct. at 179. In part, the court rejected the agency's attempt to justify its policy on the basis of a 1986 Policy Statement that the disputed schedule changes were necessary to accomplish the agency's mission efficiently and effectively. The court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This single sentence in the 1986 Policy does not,...satisfy the terms of &#x00A7; 6101. This brief declaration does not state that NWS's functions will be seriously handicapped by a holiday-blind scheduling policy. This sentence refers to accomplishing NWS's mission efficiently. Improving an agency's efficiency is different from seriously handicapping its functions. A serious handicap would jeopardize an agency's entire mission and demand priority attention throughout the organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the court's statement that schedule changes are not justified under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 when made for reasons of efficiency only. Moreover, in rejecting the agency's argument to the contrary, the court stated that a serious handicap, within the meaning of 6101, would jeopardize an agency's mission. However, the court did not have before it the issue the Union presents in its exceptions. That is, although the court held that, under section 6101, a serious handicap must exist in order to justify schedule changes with less than 7 days' advance notice, the court did not explicitly or implicitly address whether such handicap must be found to exist in an agency as a whole. As such, we reject the Union's argument that the award is deficient based on <span class="Italic">Gahagan</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Arbitrator found that the supervisor had "credibly testified" that, had he not rescheduled the grievant, "the NWS operations at the Brownsville WSO would have been seriously handicapped...." In our view, the Union's argument that the testimony of the grievant's supervisor established that he used criteria not prescribed by law in rescheduling the grievant constitutes mere disagreement with the credibility and weight given to the witness' testimony by the Arbitrator and, as such, provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent">The ability of agencies to modify work schedules under 5 USC 6101 was analyzed in <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 65 FLRA 978, 983-85 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Customs Officers are not excepted from the scheduling requirements in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Arbitrator, both 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121 contain an exception from compliance with the work scheduling requirements when the head of an executive agency "determines that his organization would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a). In order to qualify for this exception, an agency head must make a determination that "an exception from the normal scheduling was justified, in view of agency functions and the costs involved." <span class="Italic">Acuna</span>, 479 F.2d at 1362. An agency head makes a determination that the agency would be "seriously handicapped" or that "costs would be substantially increased" when the agency head justifies the need for an exception with a "discussion of the nature of work performed" by the employees and "the inherent administrative difficulties in scheduling their hours of duty." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Although not requiring "exhaustive findings," such determination must be "reasoned." <span class="Italic">Gahagan v. U.S., </span>19 Cl. Ct. 168, 179 (1989) (<span class="Italic">Gahagan</span>). A serious handicap is one that "would jeopardize an agency's entire mission and demand priority attention throughout the organization." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, an agency head fails to make such a determination simply by instructing in a policy that schedulers will prepare workweek schedules to improve efficiency. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 178-79.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's contention that the Commissioner's determination to except Customs Officers was made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121 is without merit. Although the Agency asserts that the Commissioner's determination to except Customs Officers is supported by congressional intent, this assertion fails to demonstrate that the Commissioner made a reasoned decision in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a). <span class="Italic">See Gahagan</span>, 19 Cl. Ct. at 179 (determining that the agency must provide evidence which demonstrates that the agency head made a reasoned determination in accordance with &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, the Agency relies on language contained in the Manual to support its contention that the Commissioner's determination to except Customs Officers was made in conformity with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121. However, because the Manual was superseded by the RNIAP, the Agency's reliance on it does not prove that the Commissioner excepted Customs Officers to avoid seriously handicapping the Agency in performing its functions or substantially increasing the cost of customs operations. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 27, 29-34 (conceding that, after Congress passed the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (COBRA) containing the statutory provisions for COPRA, the Manual was no longer applied to customs inspectors and that the Agency implemented COPRA through RNIAP); Interim Award at 12 (noting that Section 3 of RNIAP states that "[t]he policies and procedures contained in this Handbook take precedence over any and all other agreements, policies, or other documents or practices executed or applied by the parties previously, at either the national or local levels, concerning the matters covered within this Handbook" and that "[t]he policies and procedures contained in this Handbook reflect the parties' full and complete agreement on the matters contained and addressed herein"); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU, Chapter 137</span>, 60 FLRA 483, 487 (2004) (finding that, by its terms, Section 3 established RNIAP as the governing policies and procedures with respect to inspectional assignment matters over any and all other agreements and that, consistent with its clear terms, Section 3 terminated locally negotiated agreements concerning inspectional assignment matters).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency asserts that language contained in an Agency regulation, namely 19 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 24.16(d), supports its assertion that the Commissioner excepted Customs Officers in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, the language contained in &#x00A7; 24.16(d) does not state that the Agency's functions will be seriously handicapped, or that costs will be substantially increased, if work assignment priorities are not followed; rather, &#x00A7; 24.16(d) merely affirms that "[t]ours of duty should be aligned with the Customs workload" and that "[a]ll work assignments should be made in a manner which minimizes the cost to the government or party in interest." Because precedent indicates that changes to employees' hours of work are not justified under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 when made only to improve efficiency, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the Commissioner properly excepted Customs Officers. <span class="Italic">See Gahagan</span>, 19 Cl. Ct. at 179 (determining that the agency head did not make a determination that its costs would be substantially increased in the 1986 policy because improving efficiency might affect agency costs only marginally); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Nat'l Weather Serv.,</span> 49 FLRA 1563, 1566 (1994) (quoting <span class="Italic">Gahagan</span>, 19 Cl.

<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Agency cites phrases such as "operational need" and "budgetary limitations" contained in RNIAP to support its contention that the Commissioner's determination to except Customs Officers was made in conformity with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121. However, because precedent demonstrates that changes made to employees' work schedules are not justified when made to further the agency's mission or to address budgetary limitations, the Agency's reliance on RNIAP does not prove that the Commissioner decided to except Customs <span id="page_2259"></span>Officers from the scheduling requirements contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121 to avoid seriously handicapping the Agency in performing its functions or substantially increasing the cost of customs operations. <span class="Italic">See Gahagan</span>, 19 Cl.

<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, because the Commissioner did not make a reasoned "handicap" or "substantial cost" determination in order to justify his decision to except Customs Officers from the scheduling requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the award is deficient. <span class="Italic">See Phila.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that its scheduling practices for the holidays were in compliance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(E) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a)(5) because: (1) the Agency's scheduling policies were holiday-blind and (2) it needed to adjust schedules to changed workloads during holidays in order to prevent serious handicapping and substantially increased costs in performing its mission. However, as discussed above, (1) the Arbitrator determined that the Agency's scheduling policies, in at least some cases, were not holiday-blind; and (2) based on the evidence, the Agency head failed to make a determination of "handicap" or "substantial cost" warranting an exception from the requirement that the occurrence of holidays not affect the designation of the basic workweek. Consequently, because the Agency's scheduling practices did not comply with the requirement that the occurrence of holidays not affect the designation of the basic workweek, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the award is deficient.

<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3), "[e]xcept where the head of an Executive agency...determines that his organization would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased, he shall provide, with respect to each employee" that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;assignments to tours of duty are scheduled in advance over periods of not less than [one] week;</p>

<p class="noindent-1">These are the same conditions and requirements in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute and the accompanying regulation state that--absent certain findings by the head of an agency--that agency must provide six listed requirements concerning employees' workweek. Nothing in the statute or regulation limit an agency's ability to change an employee's workweek as long as the agency meets one of two conditions: either (1) the agency head makes a determination that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased absent the change; or (2) the change complies with the six, listed requirements of the statute and regulation. Here, the Arbitrator found, and the Union does not challenge this finding, that the Agency "provided each [grievant] the obligations listed in items (A) through (F) [of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)] during the workweek he was scheduled to work a Tuesday through Saturday schedule," including the requirement that the grievant receive two consecutive days off. Because the Agency complied with the six listed requirements of the statute and regulation, the Agency did not violate either the statute or the regulation when making the schedule change--even absent a finding of seriously handicapping the Agency's ability to function or substantial cost increase.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union relies on several Authority cases, but these cases either involve situations where an agency modified a schedule in a manner that did not comply with the six, listed requirements[14] or involved only an interpretation of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement.[15] As such, these cases do not support the Union's argument as the Arbitrator found that the Agency complied with the six, listed requirements.</p>

This regulation defines the term "workweek" as used in the FLSA and states that "[t]he beginning of the workweek may be changed if the change is intended to be permanent and is not designed to evade the overtime requirements of [the FLSA]."[17] The Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated this regulation interpreting the FLSA.[18] However, OPM, not DOL, administers the FLSA for the grievants.[19] Consequently, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 778.105 does not apply to the grievants.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, OPM has promulgated regulations interpreting the language of the FLSA--namely the definition of a "workweek"--on which the cases cited by the Union rely.[20] The OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.104 defines a "workweek" as the same as an "administrative workweek" as found in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.102.[21] In turn, &#x00A7; 610.102 defines an "administrative workweek" as "any period of [seven] consecutive [twenty-four]-hour periods."[22] The term "administrative workweek" is distinct from a "tour of duty," which is "the hours of a day...and the days of an administrative workweek...that constitute an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek."[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the current case, the Arbitrator found that the grievants' administrative workweeks did not change; rather, the Agency changed the grievants' tour of duty. Contrary to the Union's allegation that the Agency improperly changed the grievants' workweek under the FLSA, the Agency never changed the grievants' workweek at all, let alone temporarily. As such, the Union's argument does not demonstrate that the award is contrary to the FLSA, and we deny the Union's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent">An award involving a claim for credit hours was reviewed in <span class="Italic">SSA ODAR and Ass'n ALJs, IFPTE</span>, 64 FLRA 527, 529-30 (2010), sustaining the award in part and remanding for further consideration to resolve an apparent inconsistency between the award and the plain terms of a contract provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that, under the Act, matters pertaining <span id="page_2260"></span>to alternative work schedules are fully negotiable and enforceable, subject only to the Act itself or other laws superseding it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Austin, Tex.</span>, 60 FLRA 606, 608 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Act authorizes agencies to establish flexible work schedule programs which include:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;designated hours and days during which an employee on such a schedule must be present for work; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;designated hours during which an employee on such a schedule may elect the time of such employee's arrival at and departure from work, solely for such purpose or, if and to the extent permitted, for the purpose of accumulating credit hours to reduce the length of the workweek or another workday.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6122(a). <span class="Italic">Accord id. </span>&#x00A7; 6121(4) (defining "credit hours" as "any hours, within a flexible schedule established under section 6122 of this title, which are in excess of an employee's basic work requirement and which the employee elects to work so as to vary the length of a workweek or a workday"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.403 (meaning of "credit hours" in implementing regulations is provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6121). Flexible schedules that are established by a collective bargaining agreement are governed by the Act and the terms of that agreement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1).[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">In the case of employees in a unit represented by an exclusive representative, any flexible or compressed work schedule, and the establishment and termination of any such schedule, shall be subject to the provisions of this subchapter and the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue here is whether the Act prohibits a flexible schedule under which employees may earn credit hours at any time of day or night on regular workdays.&#x2003;The Arbitrator found that the only limitations on credit hour earning on regular workdays memorialized in the parties' agreement are that: (1) credit hours are earned for work performed in excess of an ALJ's basic work requirement, and (2) an ALJ can earn only up to 2.5 credit hours per regular workday. Nothing in the Act requires the parties to specify a narrower time band during which credit hours may be earned. That the parties' agreement, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, designates <span class="Italic">any </span>time outside an employee's basic work requirement as an opportunity to earn credit hours on weekdays, subject to the 2.5 credit hour maximum, is not contrary to the Act, regulations, or OPM advisory guidance cited by the Agency. Therefore, we conclude that the Act does not preclude employees from earning credit hours as provided in the Arbitrator's award. Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">We dismiss the Agency's essence exceptions in part, and remand in part.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, the Authority applies the deferential standard of review that federal courts use in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 220</span>, 54 FLRA 156, 159 (1998). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Labor </span>(<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>), 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. We remand the matter of whether ALJs are prohibited from earning credit hours after 6:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> under the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement because the Arbitrator erroneously ignored Article 14, Section 5(A)(11) when she found that nothing in the parties' agreement explicitly limits the time within which ALJs may earn credit hours on regular workdays.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 14, Section 5 of the agreement is specifically entitled "Credit Hours." Paragraph 11 of that section provides that "[s]tarting and leaving times are determined by Section 3 above." In turn, Article 14, Section 3(B) provides that ALJs "can start as early as 6:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> and leave as late as 6:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>" The Arbitrator examined Article 14, Section 3(B) and found that the permissive wording in the sentence "Judges <span class="Italic">can </span>start as early as 6:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> and leave as late as 6:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>" does not prohibit ALJs from earning credit hours after 6:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> Award at 6 (emphasis added). The Arbitrator also quoted the first two paragraphs of Section 5(A) in her award and stated that they provide the agreement's only limitations on the availability of credit hours. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>However, the Arbitrator neither referred to nor discussed Section 5(A)(11), which specifically covers when credit hours can be earned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously found that where there is an apparent inconsistency between the parties' agreement and the award at issue, but the relevant contract language has not been interpreted by the arbitrator, the award should be remanded for the arbitrator to address the contract provision in dispute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Council 220</span>, 54 FLRA at 159-60; <span class="Italic">Social Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 690, 694 (2002). "A remand in such cases permits the arbitrator, who was the parties' choice to interpret and apply their agreement, to interpret in the first instance the provision that may be dispositive of the grievance." <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 220</span>, 54 FLRA at 160.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There appears to be a conflict between the Arbitrator's interpretation of Section 5(A)(1)-(2) and the plain terms of Section 5(A)(11). At the very least, any interpretation of Section 5 must take into account the "starting and leaving times" language in paragraph 11. The Arbitrator did not take paragraph 11 into account. Absent findings by the Arbitrator on this matter, we are unable to determine whether the award is deficient. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to consider Article 14, Section 5(A)(11), in her interpretation of the award.</p>
