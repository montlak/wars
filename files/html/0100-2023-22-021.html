<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-22"><span class="space">a.</span> Prevailing Party Status Through Settlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board applied the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992), examining the tie between a settlement agreement arising during the course of litigation, an adjudicator's decision, and the petitioner's relief, <span class="Italic">Abraham v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 65 MSPR 11, 12-14 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal with the Board's regional office from the agency's action removing her from her position of Paralegal Specialist, based on unacceptable performance. While the appeal was pending before the Board's regional office, the parties reached an agreement to settle the case. The terms of the settlement agreement provided that the agency would: (1) Cancel the removal action; (2) cancel the unacceptable performance [rating] the appellant had received and replace it with a presumed performance rating of fully successful; (3) respond to any inquiries by prospective employers by stating that the appellant's "performance was satisfactory and that she voluntarily resigned for personal reasons and to seek other employment"; and to (4) retroactively reinstate the appellant to her former position with back-pay and other benefits. In consideration for the agency's agreement to these terms, the appellant agreed to resign effective July 9, 1993, 30 days from the effective date of the settlement agreement. The administrative judge found the agreement lawful and freely entered into by the parties and dismissed the appeal as settled. When neither party filed a petition for review, that decision became the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 16, 1993, the appellant filed a motion for attorney fees. In an addendum initial decision the administrative judge denied the motion finding that, because the appellant failed to show that she obtained all or a significant part of the relief that she sought from her agency, she was not a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in her petition for review that, because she was restored to her position with back pay and a retroactive satisfactory rating, she obtained a significant portion of the relief she sought and thus is a prevailing party under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the United States Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992). We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish entitlement to an award of attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701 or the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an employee must first show that she is the prevailing party. The definition of a "prevailing party" for awards of attorneys' fees under the civil rights fee-shifting statute, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988, was clarified by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Hobby.</span> In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> the court found that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...to qualify as a prevailing party, a civil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim. The plaintiff must obtain an enforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought, or comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement. Whatever relief the plaintiff secures must directly benefit him at the time of the judgment or settlement....&#8197;In short, a plaintiff "prevails" when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 573 (citations omitted). Thus, at a minimum, in order to prevail, an appellant must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute and show that the legal relationship between itself and the agency has changed. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Western Production Co.</span>, 988 F.2d 1050, 1055 (10th Cir. 1993). This change occurs when the plaintiff becomes entitled to enforce a judgment, consent decree, or settlement against the defendant. <span class="Italic">PH Group</span> <span class="Italic">Ltd v. Birch</span>, 985 F.2d 649, 652 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the dispute was resolved by an enforceable settlement agreement which provided the appellant with a better performance evaluation than she had originally received, a clean personnel record, restoration to her former position pending her forthcoming resignation, and back-pay. Thus, relying on <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span> and its progeny, the legal relationship between the parties was altered when the agency agreed to provide the appellant with benefits that it had not originally planned to give her when it effected her removal. Accordingly, because the dispute was resolved by an enforceable settlement agreement that directly benefitted the appellant, we find that the appellant is a prevailing party<span class="Italic">. See Ray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 64 MSPR 100 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the appellant is a prevailing party as a result of the settlement agreement, we must still determine whether the agreement addressed the issue of attorney fees and, if so, whether the appellant forfeited her right to obtain them. We note that, while the agreement did not provide for any fees to be paid by the agency, it did specifically provide that the appellant could file a motion for attorney fees under the standards of section 706(k)(7) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Therefore, under the terms of the settlement agreement, the appellant did not forego her right to seek an award of attorney fees based on her prevailing party status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier, interpreting <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist.</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 792-93, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed.2d 866 (1989), the Board considered that an appellant established prevailing party status if the legal relation of the appellant and the agency was altered through a settlement. <span class="Italic">McIver v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 45 MSPR 68 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized the law from the Supreme Court and clarified its own pronouncements on the degree of success required for prevailing party status in <span class="Italic">Ray v. DHHS</span>, 64 MSPR 100, 104-06 (1994), involving a settlement agreement that did not materially alter the existing relation between the parties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish entitlement to an award of attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, an employee must first show that he is the prevailing party. The Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Independent School District</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed.2d 866 (1989), that the prevailing party standard requires only that a party succeed on any issue in the litigation which achieves some of the benefit that he sought in bringing the action sufficient to change the legal relationship between the parties. In reaching this conclusion, the Court rejected a "central issue" test that measures prevailing party status based on whether the party has prevailed on the central issue in the litigation by acquiring the primary relief sought. The Court held that the central issue test is contrary to the thrust of <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983), which indicated that the degree of a party's success in relation to the lawsuit's overall goals is a factor critical to the determination of the size of a reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, __U.S.__, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992), the Court adhered to its "generous formulation" of the term "prevailing party" in civil rights attorney fee statutes announced in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, and held that, to qualify as the prevailing party, a plaintiff must simply obtain an enforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought or comparable relief through a consent decree or settlement, and that this was effective to change the legal relationship between them. The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> was deemed the prevailing party although he won a judgment for only one dollar through litigation in which he first sought $17 million in compensatory damages. The degree of success obtained was not a consideration in determining whether the plaintiff was the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that the civil rights attorney fee statute prevailing party concept is equally applicable in awarding attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) and (g)(2), the two bases of awarding fees in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Additionally, we follow the more recent guidance provided by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, and find that an appellant who obtains an enforceable judgment against the agency, or enforceable relief through a settlement agreement, is the prevailing party. In making this finding, we specifically overrule our decisions holding that, to be a prevailing party, an appellant must have substantially prevailed or have prevailed on significant portion of his claims.[17]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Buonamano v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 44 MSPR 24, 26-27 (1990); <span class="Italic">Shipp v. Department of the Interior</span>, 35 MSPR 421, 423-24 (1987); Hodnick, 4 MSPR at 375.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in this case, however, is not a prevailing party. He did not obtain an enforceable judgment against the agency, or comparable <span id="Page_4561"></span>relief through a consent decree or settlement. <span class="Italic">See Farrar</span>, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 573. Although the terms of the administrative judge's compliance initial decision would confer such status, that decision was merely a "recommended" decision. The Board need not accept this recommendation and, in fact, the Board never did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board had issued a decision either finding that the agency's post-recommended decision actions put it in compliance, or agreeing with the appellant that the declared compliance was not compliance, the appellant would have been a prevailing party. The Board, however, never addressed the recommended decision, and there is therefore no "enforceable judgment" in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was instructed to file evidence that it took the actions recommended by the administrative judge <span class="Italic">with the Clerk of the Board</span>, not with the administrative judge. The agency did file such evidence within the proper time frame, and the appellant filed a response requesting that the Board review the agency's alleged compliance, contending that the agency's actions did not constitute compliance. Before the Board could consider this matter, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. It was that agreement, and not the recommended decision, that the Board "accept[ed] into the record for enforcement purposes," dismissing the appellant's petition for enforcement "pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 57 MSPR 16, 22 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the appellant is not a prevailing party. Although the agreement is an enforceable judgment against the agency, it did not "benefit" the appellant, nor did it materially alter the legal relationship of the parties. <span class="Italic">Garland</span>, 489 U.S. at 790-92, 109 S. Ct. at 1493. It merely constituted an enforceable acceptance by the appellant of the agency's pre-petition for enforcement placement of the appellant in a GS-13 position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another analysis relating a settlement to prevailing party status is from <span class="Italic">DiGiulio v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 66 MSPR 659, 663-64 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously held that an appellant must have obtained all or a significant part of the relief requested in order to qualify for prevailing party status. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Buonamano v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 24, 26-27 (1990); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span>, 5 MSPB 432, 5 MSPR 422, 425 (1981). After the initial decision was issued, however, the Board overruled this line of cases and held that an appellant is a prevailing party if he received an enforceable judgment or settlement which directly benefitted him at the time of the judgment or settlement. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 64 MSPR 100, 105-06 (1994). An appellant is not entitled to prevailing party status, however, unless he can show that the relief obtained is causally related to the institution of proceedings before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Quintanilla v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 547, 550 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues as she did below that she was the prevailing party because, although the agency originally proposed to remove her, the deciding official mitigated the action to a demotion, and she eventually received only a voluntary downgrade through the settlement agreement....&#8197;As noted above, the agency never effected the appellant's removal, and her appeal addressed not a removal but her demotion; the appellant thus did not avoid a removal action by instituting her appeal. The fact that the agency originally proposed her removal therefore is not relevant to a determination of whether the appellant is the prevailing party in an appeal from her demotion. <span class="Italic">See Quintanilla</span>, 59 MSPR at 550.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the parties did resolve the appellant's petition for appeal from her demotion with a settlement agreement, and the relief obtained from that agreement thus was causally related to the institution of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> As noted above, the agreement provided for the withdrawal of the agency's adverse action, and that action thus will not be reflected on the appellant's employment record. And, the placement of the appellant in an LWOP status, instead of in an AWOL status, protects her against future adverse actions resulting from her continued failure to return to duty. Moreover, the record shows that the appellant (because of her medical condition) apparently preferred part-time duty to the full-time duty required in her former GM-13 position, and her assignment under the agreement to a part-time position upon her return to duty thus accords with her own preference. Finally, the provision that the appellant file an application for a disability annuity does not preclude a finding that the appellant directly benefitted from the agreement. Given the appellant's placement in an LWOP status and her unsuccessful effort to obtain continuing benefits from the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP), as well as her complaints about her physical inability to work, approval of that application would appear to represent a substantial benefit to her. Our review therefore demonstrates that the agreement directly benefitted the appellant and that she is the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result is that prevailing party status attaches through a settlement accepted by the Board in cases postdating <span class="Italic">Buckhannon.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Griffith v. USDA</span>, 96 MSPR 251, 255 &#x00B6; 10 (2004) (relation of the parties was changed through a settlement changing the basis of a removal from misconduct to the appellant's medical inability to perform the duties of the position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a result that seemed to avoid discussion of Supreme Court precedent, the Federal Circuit retreated in <span class="Italic">Irwin v. SBA</span>, 45 F.3d 417, 418-19 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Quintanilla v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 547, 549 (1993)), to a standard that measured prevailing party status by whether the appellant "obtained all, or a significant portion of, the relief sought in petitioning for appeals as a result of the institution of the appeal." In <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> the appellant achieved a settlement that secured considerably fewer benefits than the appellant demanded in her amended appeal. As a result, the appellant did not sufficiently prevail to warrant consideration for counsel fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In particular, she did not receive the bulk of the relief sought in her appeal as amended on 22 October 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Irwin contends before us that she obtained all of the relief she wanted. According to her, she amended her appeal as a negotiating tactic, but secretly only wanted the relief claimed in her timely appeal as originally filed on 24 August 1993. Thus, she argues, she has met the "prevailing party" prong of the two-prong test for entitlement to reasonable attorney fees. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party who amends a pleading as a negotiating tactic assumes the concomitant risks of that tactic. We understand a litigant's desire to present a strong front and to request more relief than the litigant ultimately may be willing to settle for. Less risky avenues were, however, available to Ms. Irwin. For example, rather than formally amending her papers before the Board, she could have kept her negotiating tactics out of the formal record. She could have informed opposing counsel by letter that she intended to amend her Notice of Appeal, possibly including a copy of a draft amendment to bolster the potency of her "threat."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case sub judice, the downside of her chosen tactic is now readily apparent. Ms. Irwin's selected tactic has deprived her of her eligibility for attorneys fees. The AJ or court making a determination under section 7701(g)(1) must compare the relief being sought at the resolution of the case to the relief actually obtained. If this were not the rule, any litigant could assert that it ultimately got want it really wanted despite what it sought in its pleadings. AJs would be required to speculate on the genuineness of amendments. We believe that AJs must be able to reply on the records before them for what they state.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Irwin</span> was gently disregarded in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 458, 462 &#x00B6; 8 (1999), determining that any recovery makes the appellant a prevailing party, although fees may be denied if the paucity of the recovery in comparison to the amount claimed suggests that a fee award is not in the interest of justice. In another case, a party prevailed who obtained reinstatement, through settlement, on a trial basis. <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 606, 610 n.6 (1990). The determination of whether the appellant prevailed through settlement is to be based on the results obtained through the appeal, not on the AJ's subjective notions as to the strengths and weaknesses of the parties' cases. <span class="Italic">Morrissey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 508, 512 n.3 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under law before Supreme Court decisions considering the impact or necessity of a decision from an adjudicator altering the legal relation of the parties, an appellant was a prevailing party if he obtained, through settlement, all or a significant part of the remedy sought through the appeal, regardless of whether there had been a Board determination on the merits. <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. BATF</span>, 5 MSPR 422, 425, 5 MSPB 432 (1981). Despite the expansive holding of <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, fees were denied. The employee obtained only a token settlement. The appellant, who was downgraded from a GS-13, step 1, to GS-12, settled his case on the basis of a downgrade from GS-13/1 to GS-12/10. Although this relief seemed at least part of what the appellant sought, the Board deemed it too insubstantial to reflect prevailing party status. Settlement of a case by conversion of a removal to a resignation with a few months of back pay, and an opportunity for the appellant to place an explanatory note in her personnel file, did not constitute relief significant enough to confer prevailing party status despite the appellant's claims that she was unable to work because of poor health and did not want to be restored to duty. <span class="Italic">Shipp v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 35 MSPR 421, 425 (1987). Another settlement left an appellant without prevailing party status or fees when the appellant's demotion was canceled, but he took a voluntary downgrade with retained pay and an agreement to retire by a definite date in the future. <span class="Italic">Buonamano v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 24, 27 (1990). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McIver v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 45 MSPR 68, 71-72 (1990) (fees were awarded following the settlement of a removal by voluntary downgrade on excellent terms for the employee).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant did not become a prevailing party through a settlement that allowed the appellant an opportunity to be retrained and to be reinstated in a position, without back pay, if training was successful. The removal was not canceled. There was no award of back pay, and the appellant was not reinstated at the time of the fee motion. <span class="Italic">Bonds v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 546, 548-49 (1987). An appellant prevailed who settled by having his removal canceled, agreeing to apply for disability retirement, and securing priority consideration for restoration to duty if and when he recovered from his medical condition. <span class="Italic">Hutchison v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 491, 494-95 (1988) (fees were not, however, in the interest of justice). Another appellant prevailed who, through settlement <span id="Page_4562"></span>of a removal, received retroactive reinstatement to his former position, 75% of the maximum amount of back pay that could have been awarded, and accommodation of his disabling condition. <span class="Italic">D'Iorio v. DHUD</span>, 43 MSPR 531, 534 (1990).</p>
