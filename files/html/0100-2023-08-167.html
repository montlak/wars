<h6 class="h6" id="sec1-165"><span class="space">(ii)</span> Other TSA Employees</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/439/f3d/1329/coradeschi-v-department-of-homeland-security">439 F.3d 1329</a>, 1330-33 (Fed. Cir. 2006),<span class="Italic"></span> that Civilian Aviation Security Specialists (federal air marshals) have Board appeal rights if they qualify as "employees" under Title 5:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Coradeschi began federal service with the U.S. Coast Guard upon graduation from the Coast Guard Academy in 1983. He served six and a half years with the Coast Guard and one year with the Naval Investigation Service, after which he worked five years as a private investigator. He reentered federal service in 1997 as an inspector with the Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS"). After one year, he became an INS agent, which he remained until June of 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an INS agent, Coradeschi held an 1801 occupation code. His position description indicates that some of his major duties were to enforce immigration laws and arrest illegal aliens. As part of those duties, he had to interpret the laws and make determinations regarding alienage, immigration status, and deportability. Moreover, Coradeschi was required to carry a firearm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 23, 2002, Coradeschi received an appointment with the TSA as a Civil Aviation Security Specialist, also known as a Federal Air Marshal ("FAM"). His offer letter, which he signed and dated on June 18, 2002, contained a paragraph stating, "All Federal Air Marshals must serve a probationary period to be completed 12 months after the granting of credentials and receipt of a Top Secret Security Clearance." However, Coradeschi's "Notification of Personnel Action," effective five days later, states that his appointment is "subject to completion of a 1-year trial period beginning 06-23-2002. Service counting towards permanent tenure from 6-23-2002." Coradeschi states that he was advised that he would not be subject to a probationary period because as an INS agent he had the same 1801 occupational code as a FAM and TSA Policy Bulletin #6 concerning probationary periods for FAMs (the "TSA Bulletin"), which was effective January 24, 2002, granted an exception to the new probationary period "for current Federal employees who are appointed to FAM positions from within the same series, i.e. an employee currently in the 1801 series."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After he started work as a FAM, Coradeschi underwent a seven-day Air Marshal Training Program. According to Coradeschi, this advanced training included over 31 hours of administrative matters, 12.5 hours of firearms training, and 13.75 hours of tactical and operations training. Normally, new FAMs were first required to attend the Criminal Investigator Course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; however, the TSA waived this requirement for Coradeschi because of his INS agent training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 23, 2003, a year after being hired, Coradeschi received another "Notification of Personnel Action" that indicated his trial period was complete and his tenure group had changed. Two months later on August 20, 2003, he received his Top Secret Security Clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 7, 2004, Coradeschi failed to remove a fully-loaded magazine of ammunition from his person upon arrival at Tel Aviv, Israel, contrary <span id="Page_272"></span>to his team member's instructions to place his weapon and ammunition in a lockbox. When he returned to the airport on January 9, 2004, he was detained by security screeners. Considering this violation, two prior "firearms incidents," and a previous verbal counseling, the Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge at the Newark Field Office, Tim Masluk, terminated Coradeschi on February 10, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The termination letter indicated that Coradeschi was a probationary employee because he had not completed 12 months as a FAM after he was granted credentials. The letter, however, indicated that he could appeal to the MSPB if he felt that he was "a non-preference eligible[ ] who ha[d] completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon appeal to the MSPB, the AJ dismissed Coradeschi's appeal. The AJ found that Coradeschi's previous INS agent work was not sufficiently "similar" to the FAM position to grant jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Despite finding that both positions involved law enforcement and shared the same 1801 occupation code, the AJ found several dissimilarities, including: an INS agent enforces immigration laws at his office and at a variety of business establishments, whereas the FAM deters criminal acts onboard aircraft; the FAM must undergo specialized training for the close confines of an aircraft and obtain top secret security clearance, whereas the INS agent does not have to do either; and finally, unlike the INS agent, the FAM must be physically capable of "long, arduous hours of international air travel." Thus, the AJ concluded that Coradeschi had not established jurisdiction by pleading non-frivolously that the INS agent position was "similar" to the FAM position. The AJ did not hold an evidentiary hearing to ascertain and determine whether the allegations made regarding the probationary period termination and previous INS work were sufficient to invoke MSPB jurisdiction and require a merits hearing.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) removed the appellant from her SV-1811-J Special Agent (Criminal Investigator) position based on a charge of "Unsuitability for Federal Service," which was supported by two specifications. The agency determined that the appellant had been terminated by a prior employer for misconduct, and had failed to disclose that termination on her Standard Form 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions. After the appellant filed a timely appeal of the removal with the Board, the agency moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The agency asserted that the appellant was an excepted service employee with no right to appeal the "suitability determination" because such an appeal right to the Board is granted only to applicants for, or employees in, competitive service or Senior Executive Service positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is not obligated to accept the assertion of a party as to the nature of a personnel action, but may make its own independent determination regarding the matter. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 704 (1981). Thus, it is the nature of the action, and not the agency's characterization of the action, that determines the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the agency characterizes the action in this case as a "suitability determination" and contends that the appellant may not appeal such an action because she occupied a position in the excepted service. However, 5 C.F.R. part 731, relating to "Suitability," establishes the criteria and procedures for making determinations of suitability for employment only for "positions in the competitive service and for career appointments in the Senior Executive Service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(a). Thus, section 731.103, under which the Office of Personnel Management delegates to agency heads limited authority for adjudicating suitability cases involving applicants for and appointees to competitive service positions, and section 731.105(b), under which an agency, exercising delegated authority, may take a suitability action "under this part," do not serve as authority for the agency's removal action in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant worked for TSA, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) applies in this case. <span class="Italic">Lara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 9 (2004). Under ATSA, TSA employees are covered by the personnel management system that is applicable to employees of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122, except to the extent that the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security modifies that system as it applies to TSA employees. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n); <span class="Italic">Lara</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 9. Under the personnel management system that is applicable to FAA employees, the removal of an individual who meets the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 may be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), 7512(1), 7513(d) (providing "employees," as defined in section 7511(a)(1), with the right to appeal removals and other adverse actions to the Board); <span class="Italic">Zambito v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as long as the Under Secretary has not modified the FAA's personnel management system so as to preclude TSA employees such as the appellant from appealing their removals, the appellant would have Board appeal rights if she is: (1) A preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency; or (2) an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible) who has completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no indication, and the agency has not argued, that the Under Secretary has modified the FAA's personnel management system so as to preclude TSA employees such as the appellant from appealing <span id="Page_273"></span>their removals.[5] Moreover, the record reflects that the agency appointed the appellant to an SV-1801-J Transportation Security Specialist position on or about June 17, 2002, and reassigned her to the SV-1811-J Criminal Investigator position effective June 30, 2002. The agency removed the appellant from the Criminal Investigator position effective upon her November 19, 2004 receipt of the agency's November 18, 2004 decision notice. Thus, regardless of whether the appellant was a preference-eligible employee, she has shown by preponderant evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal because she was an individual in the excepted service who completed two years of current continuous service in the same Criminal Investigator position and she was subjected to an adverse action that is appealable to the Board.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that <span class="Italic">Zufan</span>, which involved an appeal filed by an applicant for employment from a suitability determination made by the FAA, does not require dismissal of this case for lack of jurisdiction.

(114 Stat.) 61 (Ford Act), added 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3), which states that, under the new personnel management system for FAA employment matters, an employee of the FAA may submit an appeal to the Board and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996. <span class="Italic">Zufan</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 15. The Board found that Mr. Zufan had no right to appeal his nonselection under the Ford Act because he was an applicant, but never an FAA employee as required by the Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 16. <span class="Italic">In dictum</span>, the Board noted that, even assuming that Mr. Zufan could have established that he was an "employee" under section 40122(g)(3), "the right to appeal negative suitability determinations relates only to applicants for, or employees in, the competitive service or SES positions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 16 n.*. Thus, the Board held that, to "establish jurisdiction," Mr. Zufan would have to show that the position he applied for was in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The footnote in <span class="Italic">Zufan</span> addressed the narrow question of whether, even if Mr. Zufan had been an "employee" under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3), the Board would have had jurisdiction over the appeal of the appellant's nonselection as a suitability determination under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501. It did not address whether the Board had jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), 7512(1), and 7513(d). As set forth above, the agency in this case did not take a suitability action under 5 C.F.R. part 731 against an "appointee" in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b) (defining "appointee" as a person who has entered on duty and is in the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment). Instead, it took an action against an appellant who, unlike Mr. Zufan, was an "employee" who has the right to appeal the agency action at issue, i.e., a removal, to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), 7512(1), and 7513(d). In any event, the footnote in <span class="Italic">Zufan</span> was unnecessary to the decision in that case, and therefore not binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">See Smith v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an initial decision granting the agency's motion and dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The administrative judge applied TSA Management Directive No. 1100.75-1 ("Addressing Performance and Conduct Problems"), &#x00A7; 6F1(A), which provides that "[n]on-screener employees with veterans' preference who have at least one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position" may appeal a removal.

The administrative judge concluded that the Screening Manager and Deputy AFSD positions did not require substantially the same or similar qualifications. The administrative judge determined that the appellant did not have one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position because the appellant had served fewer than nine months as a Deputy AFSD and his prior service as a Screening Manager did not count towards the current continuous service requirement. As to the appellant's argument that he had been performing Deputy AFSD duties since December 2002, when he filled in for a Deputy AFSD who went on vacation, the administrative judge looked to cases under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) to conclude that the time the appellant spent in an acting capacity is not creditable toward completion of the one-year service requirement.</p>

Nonetheless, the outcome of the appeal remains unchanged because, as the administrative judge acknowledged, under both TSA Management Directive No. 1100.75-1 and section 7511(a)(1)(B), we are required to determine whether the appellant had at least one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the administrative judge erred in relying upon cases under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 to determine that the appellant's time spent as an acting Deputy AFSD was not creditable toward the one year of current continuous service requirement. He asserts that the administrative judge should have applied TSA Management Directive No. 1100.31-1, &#x00A7; 6J5, which states that service in a supervisory or managerial position while on a detail or a temporary promotion is credited toward the completion of the supervisory or managerial trial period. Because the appellant began performing Deputy AFSD duties in December 2002 on an acting basis, and because the SF-50 for the Deputy AFSD position indicated that the trial period began on March 31, 2003, the appellant maintains that he completed the one-year trial period before his August 2004 removal. Thus, he argues, he should be afforded the right to appeal his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly relied upon cases under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 to conclude that time spent in a position on detail or in an acting capacity may not be used to establish that the appellant completed the one year of current continuous service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">See Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 588, 590 n.* (1993); <span class="Italic">Goodman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 127, 129 (1988). First, as discussed above, we have concluded that we must determine whether the appellant meets the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, rather than the definition in TSA Management Directive No. 1100.75-1. Second, the appellant's reliance upon TSA Management Directive No. 1100.31-1, &#x00A7; 6J5 and his completion of his trial period is misplaced. The issue here is not whether the appellant had completed a trial period but whether he had one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position. The administrative judge correctly concluded that TSA Management Directive No. 1100.31-1, which relates to trial periods, did not directly address the issue of whether time spent in an acting capacity or detail is creditable toward the one-year service requirement. The appellant points to no authority to show that time spent on detail or in an acting capacity is creditable toward the requirement that he have one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not argue on review that the Screening Manager and the Deputy AFSD positions are "similar" within the meaning of either TSA Management Directive No. 1100.31-1 or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). A review of the record, nonetheless, shows that the two positions are not similar. Positions are similar within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) if they "involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). While the appellant's description of the work performed as a Screening Manager and a Deputy AFSD shows that there is overlap in the work he performed in the two positions, it also shows that he performed a significant amount of work as a Deputy AFSD that was not required of a Screening Manager. Thus, the work performed in the two positions is not comparable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities listed for each position indicate that the Deputy AFSD position requires skills over and above those expected from a Screening Manager. For example, the Deputy AFSD position requires advanced experience with, and knowledge of, explosives detections systems, explosives trace detections systems, and other security screening equipment; criteria for equipment approval; and protocols for operational testing and evaluation, configuration management, regulations, and standards and procedures associated with operational use of advanced technology screening equipment. In contrast, the Screening Manager position requires only knowledge of the aviation screening process to enable handling of screening functions and knowledge sufficient to operate basic security equipment at screening checkpoints. The Deputy AFSD position requires the ability, "to plan and organize work, set priorities, develop schedules, set milestones, formulate plans, and assess progress toward predetermined goals and objectives," while the Screening Manager merely requires skill in managing staff on various shifts, communicating orally and in writing, assigning work, improving performance, and selecting employees. Finally, the Deputy AFSD position requires advanced knowledge of, "acquisition management, procurement planning, capital budgeting and investment analysis, fiscal management, and quantitative analysis," while the Screening Manager position has no comparable requirement. Thus, the Screening Manager and Deputy AFSD positions were not the same or similar under <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that, because the Board has held that time spent in a temporary appointment should be credited toward completion of the one year of current continuous service, his time spent as an acting Deputy AFSD should be "tacked" to the time following his official appointment to the Deputy AFSD position. It appears, however, that the appellant confuses a temporary appointment to a position, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. part 316, subpart D, with time spent in a position on detail or an acting basis, and the cases upon which he relies are inapposite. In any event, the time that the appellant spent in the temporary Screening Manager position cannot be tacked with time he spent in the Deputy AFSD position, as the two positions were not similar. <span class="Italic">See Enocencio v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 6 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant failed to establish that he had completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions prior to his removal, we conclude that the appeal was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant worked as a Civil Aviation Security Specialist, also known as an Aviation Security Inspector (ASI), at the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport since December 30, 2001. In this position, the appellant was responsible for assessing and investigating the airport and air carriers to monitor compliance with applicable transportation security policies, regulations, and agreements, and for providing technical guidance on the development and modification of security plans to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The appellant, along with a large group of ASIs, was transferred to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) on March 23, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 28, 2003, the appellant's supervisor, Jennifer Aszalos, issued <span id="Page_275"></span>a memorandum of counseling to the appellant for unacceptable performance and failure to meet deadlines. For the same reasons, Ms. Aszalos gave the appellant an unsatisfactory performance rating for fiscal year 2003 on October 23, 2003. Ms. Aszalos placed the appellant on an Opportunity to Demonstrate Performance (ODP) plan to assist the appellant in reaching the "at" or "above" level for "meets expectations." The completion date of the ODP was extended twice in late 2003 by Ms. Aszalos to June 30, 2004. On August 9, 2004, Ms. Aszalos issued a notice of proposed removal for unsatisfactory performance to the appellant. After providing the appellant with an opportunity to respond, Assistant Federal Security Director for Law Enforcement Thomas Brandon issued the agency's final decision removing the appellant, effective November 7, 2004.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the ID, the AJ first found that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal under TSA Management Directive No. 1100.75-3, citing 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2). She then noted that the appeal is governed by the provisions of TSA's personnel management system addressing performance and conduct problems, rather than by chapter 75 of title 5. The AJ sustained both specifications of the agency's charge of unsatisfactory performance, finding that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant failed to meet expectations in two critical elements: (1) Conducts inspections and provides technical assistance; and (2) conducts investigations and prepares reports of the findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also found that the appellant failed to demonstrate harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures and failed to prove her affirmative defenses of discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence because she failed to identify similarly situated individuals who had performance problems but who were not removed. Additionally, the AJ found that the appellant did not establish that the removal was based on a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). Based on testimonial and documentary evidence, the AJ further found that, while the appellant engaged in protected activity by filing an EEO complaint, she failed to establish that she was retaliated against because of it. The AJ also held that the appellant did not prove that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(7), a merit system principle, by failing to train her; in this regard, the AJ found that there was no evidence that the agency abused its discretion with respect to her training. Lastly, the AJ concluded that the removal action was taken "for such cause as promotes the efficiency of the service," that the deciding official considered the appropriate <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, and that the penalty of removal did not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the maxim of statutory interpretation <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>, where, as here, a statute enumerates certain exceptions to a general rule, it is preferable not to interpret the statute as containing other, unenumerated exceptions. <span class="Italic">King v.

Thus, in enumerating certain exceptions to the general rule that title 5 does not apply to the personnel management system, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2) dictates that any other provision of title 5 not specifically enumerated is excluded from application to the personnel management system. Significantly, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(7) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12) are not listed among the exceptions cited in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2).</p>

Because sections 2301(b)(7) and 2302(b)(12) are clearly excluded from 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2), they do not apply to the TSA personnel management system. Consequently, the Board cannot address a claimed violation of these provisions in the context of an appeal filed by a TSA employee, and therefore the administrative judge erred in considering such a claim.</p>
