<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-160"><span class="space">e.</span> Postal Service Reorganization</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In the unusual case of a massive, ill-fated Postal Service reorganization, the Board concluded that the agency did not have to retroactively rescind an invalid RIF. Instead, other means could be employed to make the appellant whole. <span class="Italic">Sink v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 628, 632-34 (1994), involved a delay in the return of the employee to his prior position pending recalculation of RIF rights. <span class="Italic">Sink</span> summarized decisions concerning permissible bases for reassignment or detail in lieu of immediate return of the employee to his old position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]here the appellant has not been reinstated to perform the work of his prior job, the Board must next inquire into whether that position still exists at the same grade level and classification, and if so, the Board will then examine the agency's reasons to determine if they constitute "a strong overriding interest," or a "compelling" reason that suffices to justify its failure to restore the appellant to the full <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will give careful scrutiny to an agency's decision not to return an employee to his former job. In appropriate circumstances, however, it has found that the right to be returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is not unconditional. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Yokley v. US Postal Service</span>, 57 MSPR 482, 485-86 (1993) (in compliance with its regulations, the agency may require an appellant returning to work after a removal to undergo a fitness for duty examination if he has been off duty for more than a year); <span class="Italic">Connor v. US Postal Service</span>, 50 MSPR 389, 392-93 (1991) (the agency was justified in requiring the employee to undergo a fitness for duty examination before reinstatement because of its concerns arising from his actions and the length of his absence from duty). <span class="Italic">See also Coffey v. US Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 533, 538, <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 22 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), finding that the appellant's refusal to submit to a psychiatric examination that is based on a well-founded concern about his fitness constitutes a compelling reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board has found that the agency had a compelling reason for not returning the appellant to his former job under special circumstances, such as where he was convicted of a criminal offense directly related to his job, <span class="Italic">Payne v. US Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 317, 320-21 (1992); where the appellant's driving record rendered him unfit for his transportation position, <span class="Italic">Burrell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 174, 176-77 (1990); and where he lacks a required security clearance, <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 586, 594 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another category of compliance-related cases with some similarity to the instant appeal involves those in which temporary or transitory factors affect the requirement for immediate compliance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span>, 58 MSPR at 594, finding the agency's efforts to restore the appellant's security clearance constituted sufficient reason for not yet returning him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 285, 286-87 (1987), the Board found that the appellant's temporary lack of a government driver's license justified delayed compliance.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note, too, that the Board has also found that return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> need not always require a perfect consistency between all aspects of the appellant's pre- and post-removal positions. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Smith v. US Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 417, 423 (1994) (a change in the appellant's work schedule, absent a loss of pay differential or other evidence of harm, is within the agency's discretion); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 53 MSPR 78, 82 (1992) (agency is authorized, in the absence of evidence of punitive reasons, to change a former night shift employee to the day shift), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 988 F.2d 130 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). A comparatively minor change of this sort is not at issue in the instant appeal, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, first, that the cases discussed above provide no basis for a conclusion that the appellant is not entitled to be returned as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Unlike <span class="Italic">Yokley, Connor</span>, and <span class="Italic">Coffey</span>, the agency's action does not constitute simply a precondition to the appellant's return to his former position. Unlike <span class="Italic">Payne</span>, <span class="Italic">Burrell</span>, and <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, where the appellants' misconduct led to their disqualification for their former jobs, no misconduct on the appellant's part is involved here. Nor, unlike <span class="Italic">LaBatte</span>, where only a temporary disqualification was also involved, is the issue of compliance entwined with security concerns, a matter as to which the Board will give agencies special deference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Sink</span>, the realignments caused by the Postal Service reorganization justified the agency's delay in returning the appellant to his prior job, 65 MSPR at 634-35:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts of the instant appeal, we next find that the record indicates that the appellant's position was abolished in the restructuring. There is no contention that this is not the case, and the appellant admits in his declaration that it was. We therefore conclude that the agency has demonstrated a compelling reason for not returning him to that job. This finding requires that we determine whether the position into which the agency has placed the appellant is substantially the same as his former job. The appellant has asserted that it is not, and the agency has not argued to the contrary. Instead, the agency has indicated that it is relying on its plans and preparations for conducting a RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decisions in this and its lead decisions, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">White v. US Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 299 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Robinson v. US Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 307 (1994), however, did not require the agency to run a RIF. Although they required that the agency do so <span class="Italic">if</span> it was to restructure at all, they did not require that it restructure. Rather, the compliance requirement in each case was to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. The agency has made no efforts to do so, beyond its paper reassignment action. Nor has it acted to assure that the position in which the appellant continues to work is similar to his former job. Since, even where a compelling reason for not restoring the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> exists, the appellant is entitled to be restored as a nearly as possible to it, we find that the agency is not in compliance with our order. <span class="Italic">See Nielson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 332, 335-36 (1987), <span class="Italic">appeal after</span> <span class="Italic">remand, Nielson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 324, 327 (1988) (RIF compliance required the appellant's return to a position that involved duties similar to those of his prior position); <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 545, 558 (1993) (where the RIF which allegedly abolished the appellant's position actually created two positions from it, the appellant was entitled to restoration to one of those positions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining what is "possible" in this case, however, the Board cannot ignore the reality of the situation facing the agency, in which thousands of employees were assigned to different positions or otherwise affected by its restructuring, and in which it will be required by this Board's decisions to conduct a RIF if it is to effect that restructuring. A RIF affects not only the person who ultimately is changed to a different position, but also to a greater or lesser extent, all other agency employees whose retention standing must be determined and found superior or inferior before any individual action can properly be effected. As we have previously held, the Board may "weigh practical and public policy considerations in reaching its decisions." <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. US Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 536, 555 (1994). Further, significant considerations of public policy may have to give way in situations where they are outweighed by the agency's imperative to perform its mission<span class="Italic">. See Scofield v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 179, 188 (1992). <span class="Italic">See also Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 807 F.2d 169, 172-73 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in which the court, noting the situation facing the agency as a result of a nationwide strike, held in a compliance proceeding that it was necessary to arrive at "a reasonable generalized rule that was fair to all and that made each of the restored controllers as nearly whole as possible."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that while the agency has stated that it intends to implement the first RIFs quickly, it has not cited an ending date for its actions or stated when this appellant will be provided a notice of his further placement. Thus, we conclude that the agency must either reinstate the appellant in his former position or issue him a specific notice of RIF, consistent with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.801(a)(1). However, recognizing the magnitude of the effect of the Board's reversal of its reorganization on the agency, we will extend the time for compliance with this order for 120 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wittl v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 20, 25 (1987) (the Board's enforcement authority is continuing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in light of the extended compliance period and the unusual circumstances, the Board appoints Llewellyn Fischer, General Counsel of the Board, to serve as Special Compliance Officer in this case. Mr. Fischer will have full oversight responsibility, including the authority to require periodic progress reports, set deadlines, initiate conference calls, issue show cause orders, and to take whatever other steps are necessary and appropriate to obtain full compliance with this Order. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(b) (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sink v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 497, 499 (1995) (sequel to the enforcement litigation: Board dismissed its objections to compliance because the "appellant's objections to the agency's evidence of compliance go beyond the scope of this compliance proceeding and address the merits of the RIF action itself"); <span class="Italic">Unhoch v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 651, 655-56 (1995) ("[t]he agency must first cancel the demotion actions that were appealed.... After that has been accomplished, then the agency must either restore the appellants to their former positions or issue them a specific notice of RIF[.]"), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Di Pietro v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 686, 690 (1997) (enforcement case involving an appellant whose job had been abolished through reorganization, the agency's only obligation was to issue the appellant, in good faith, a specific RIF notice).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sink</span> was summarized in <span class="Italic">Perisho v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 55, 57 n.1 (1995), concluding the appeal moot because, through the compliance RIF, the employee obtained all the relief he could have received had he successfully prosecuted his appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This action was taken pursuant to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Sink v. US Postal <span id="Page_5004"></span>Service</span>, 65 MSPR 628 (1994). The Board had previously reversed numerous restructuring-related demotions on appeals filed by preference eligibles, finding that they constituted improperly effected RIF actions. In <span class="Italic">Sink</span>, 65 MSPR at 635-36, and as since extended to all other similar appeals, the Board held that the agency could comply with its reversal of such demotions either by reinstating each appellant to his former position or issuing him a specific notice of RIF, consistent with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.801. The agency chose the latter course with respect to this appellant and, according to its evidence, all preference eligibles, whether or not they had appealed their demotions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Beams v. US Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 629 (1995) (issuance of a specific RIF notice constitutes compliance in the context of the agency's nationwide restructuring).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again summarized its analysis of the actions required by the Postal Service to make right the problems that occurred during its reorganization, <span class="Italic">Manescalchi v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 479, 484-86 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In previous cases where an appellant has successfully challenged a RIF, the Board has directed the agency to reconstruct the RIF that was run incorrectly, thereby protecting the RIF rights of the successful appellant to a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedy. <span class="Italic">See Certain Former CSA Employees v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 762 F.2d 978, 983-85 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Board remedy of ordering agency to retroactively determine employees' retention standing was appropriate); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Washington v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 22 MSPR 377, 379 (1984) (upon reversal of appealed action, employee's return to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> required retroactive determination of effect of RIF that had been accomplished during his unjustified separation), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 180 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency, however, has other possible compliance options. Obviously, it has the independent authority to cancel a RIF altogether, and to restore a successful RIF appellant to the original position that was encumbered prior to the RIF demotion or termination. The Board cannot demand that an agency run a RIF, only that it run one properly, should it choose to run one at all. <span class="Italic">See Sink</span>, 65 MSPR at 634.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sink</span> the Board ordered the agency to cancel the illegal RIF and to restore the appellant to his former duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 634-35. Given the magnitude of the agency's reorganization, however, the Board understood that the appellant's former duties might well no longer be available, and that restoration to those duties would not be possible. Thus, the Board recognized that the agency would need to conduct a new RIF of the restored appellant to place him in his proper position in the agency. To ensure that the appellant would receive his rights in a timely manner, the Board ordered that, if the agency chose not to restore the successful appellant to his former position, the agency must then provide him with a specific RIF notice within a particular time frame, thereby placing him into the best available position to which he was entitled under RIF regulations. In so ordering, the Board did not direct the agency to determine the best available position retroactive to 1992-93. 65 MSPR at 635. We, therefore, agree with the agency's assertion that <span class="Italic">Sink</span> does not require it to conduct a retroactive RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as the agency argues, using 1995 circumstances for determining assignment rights prevents both the unfair treatment of preference-eligible employees who have received promotions as part of the restructuring, or thereafter, and the administrative burden of placing those current incumbents in yet other positions. Examining positions, as they existed in 1992-93, to determine assignment rights would enable employees whose demotions were reversed to displace these incumbents of their positions where the incumbents had been unaffected by the original reorganization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we stated in <span class="Italic">Sink</span>, we cannot ignore the reality of the situation facing the agency, where thousands of employees are affected by its restructuring, in determining the appropriateness of its compliance efforts. We accept the agency's explanation that requiring determination of assignment rights on the basis of positions as they existed in 1992-93, would diminish its ability to effectively perform its mission by creating the administrative burden of displacing those employees now encumbering those formerly vacant positions, and then conducting additional rounds of RIF to place those incumbents in yet other positions. These significant policy considerations further warrant the conclusion that the agency correctly determined the appellant's assignment rights on the basis of positions as they existed at the time of the compliance RIF in 1995. <span class="Italic">See Sink</span>, at 635.</p>
