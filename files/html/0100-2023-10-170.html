<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-170"><span class="space">j.</span> Change in Judge Without Finding of Bias</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Chianelli v. EPA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3010), unfortunately a nonprecedential decision, the Federal Circuit explained both the basis for reassignment of an AJ in an administrative case and the considerable discretion vested in the Board when it considers the AJ's conduct of a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying Mr. Chianelli's request for reassignment of his remanded IRA appeal, the Board concluded that his claims of bias "are based on the administrative judge's perceived adjudicatory errors. As such, he has failed to set forth any evidence to overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators and has not provided a basis for appointing a new administrative judge on remand." <span class="Italic">Chianelli v. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, 81 MSPR 141, 145-46 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994), the Supreme Court recognized that evidence of a federal judge's "deep-seated...antagonism" toward a party can under some circumstances (albeit rarely) constitute a basis for a successful bias or partiality motion under the federal judicial recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455:[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]pinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion <span class="Italic">unless they display</span> <span class="Italic">a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair</span> <span class="Italic">judgment</span> <span class="Italic">impossible</span>. Thus, judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge. They may do so if they reveal an opinion that derives from an extrajudicial source; and they <span class="Italic">will</span> do so if they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 555 (first emphasis added; second and third emphases in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Subsection (a) of that statute provides, in pertinent part, that "[a]ny justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455(a). Subsection (b) further provides, in pertinent part, that any of those judicial officers "shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances: (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party..."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The federal statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> by its terms does not apply to the Board's administrative judges. Rather, the authority to disqualify those officials for personal bias arises from section 556 of the Administrative Procedure Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 556(b),[4] and the Board's own regulation, codified at 5 CFR 1201.42.[5] We believe, however, that the Supreme Court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> regarding the disqualification of federal judges applies with equal force to the disqualification of administrative judges. Indeed, we note that the Board has previously looked to the language of 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455 and corresponding federal case law, including the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, when deciding the propriety of an administrative judge's denial of a disqualification motion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Washington v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 81 MSPR 101, 104 (1999) ("There is no requirement that the Board be bound by the federal judicial rule, inasmuch as it is not a court, but...we see no reason not to look to the rule and case law arising from 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455, where relevant..."). We conclude that Mr. Chianelli properly raised a question of bias by the administrative judge in his 1999 reassignment request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;That statute provides, in pertinent part, that "[T]he functions of presiding employees and of employees participating in decisions...shall be conducted in an impartial manner. A presiding or participating employee may at any time disqualify himself. On the filing in good faith of a timely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or other disqualification of a presiding or participating employee, the agency shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the case." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 556(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Subsection (b) of that regulation provides, in pertinent part, that "[a] party may file a motion asking the judge to withdraw on the basis of personal bias or other disqualification. This motion must be filed as soon as the party has reason to believe there is a basis for disqualification. The reasons for the request must be set out in an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.42(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While any bias by the administrative judge is unlikely to have had affected the result, given the Board's independent review, the Supreme Court has made clear that denial of the right to an impartial judge can never be harmless error. <span class="Italic">See Chapman v.</span> <span class="Italic">California</span>, 386 U.S. 18, 23 &#x0026; n.8 (1966) (stating that the right to an impartial judge is an example of a constitutional right "so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error"); <span class="Italic">see also In re Murchison</span>, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955). We must therefore address this question of the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, the Supreme Court suggested that reviewing bodies have discretion to require reassignment upon remand even where recusal would not be required. <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, 510 U.S. at 554. We believe that the Board plainly had the authority to reassign this case to another administrative judge on the first appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Sawyer</span>, 120 F.3d 1307, 1334 (5th Cir. 1997) (reassigning case on remand to another district court judge "to preserve the appearance of impartiality, fairness and justice"); <span class="Italic">Gallagher</span> <span class="Italic">v. Dep't of the Air</span> Force, 84 MSPR 441, 443 (1999) (reassigning case on remand to a different administrative judge "because the appearance of partiality here has sufficiently tainted the proceeding below"). But we conclude that its failure to reassign this case is not reversible error because the bias statute did not require recusal. The source of bias here was not extrajudicial, and the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> has told us that recusal is not required in such circumstances unless we find "such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible." 510 U.S. at 555. While the administrative judge's comments were clearly inappropriate, they did not rise to that level.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smolinski v. MSPB</span>, 23 F.3d 1345, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2022), declined an invitation to direct reassignment of an AJ in an IRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, Dr. Smolinski argues we should reassign this case to a different administrative judge. He cites "the magnitude of the AJ's errors--dismissing the entirety of Appellant's appeal in a singlehandedly devastating manner." Reassignment is an extraordinary remedy that requires "a showing of 'a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.'" <span class="Italic">Bieber v. Dep't of Army</span>, 287 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994)). We see nothing in the administrative judge's opinion that suggests any bias, much less "deep-seated favoritism or antagonism." We therefore deny Dr. Smolinski's reassignment request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On occasion the Board will reassign an appeal to a different AJ following remand. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. FDIC</span>, 90 MSPR 159, 164-65 n.1 (2001) (mentally impaired <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant experienced difficult and confusion during the hearing: "In <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 554 the Supreme Court suggested that reviewing bodies have discretion to require reassignment upon remand even where recusal would not be required. In view of the above and considering the ordeal this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant endured in the proceeding below, the Board, relying on <span class="Italic">Liteky</span>, as cited in <span class="Italic">Chianelli v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 2001 WL 534142 (Fed. Cir.), would reassign this case to another administrative judge on remand."). A different AJ was assigned on remand in <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 84 MSPR 441, 442-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (1999), because of some allegedly inappropriate remarks of the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted below basically uncontroverted sworn statements that during a recess in the hearing, she, her representative, and the videotape operator overheard the AJ and two unidentified individuals make disparaging remarks about the appellant, the presentation of her case, and the truthfulness of a witness in the room in which the AJ was conducting the video hearing. The appellant immediately objected to the continuation of the hearing before the AJ and sought certification of an interlocutory appeal of the AJ's denial of her motion to disqualify the AJ. The AJ denied her motion to certify the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without deciding whether the AJ actually made the remarks attributed to him or heard the remarks of the other people in the room, we find that the circumstances justify the perception that the adjudication was not impartial. Given the fundamental and overriding requirement that the Board conduct impartial hearings, even the appearance of partiality can undermine the respect for the Board's adjudicatory process. We find that the appearance of partiality here has sufficiently tainted the proceeding below, thereby warranting a remand and a new adjudication before a different AJ.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCarty v. EPA</span>, 108 MSPR 45, 53-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18, 2008 MSPB 21 (2008), remanded a case for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing by another AJ based in part on the Board's perception of inappropriate hearing conduct by the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1447"></span>We also find that the hearing transcript documents several instances of troubling conduct on the part of the AJ. For example, the AJ suggested that the only way that the appellant could prove that Bolen or Karl was aware of her alleged whistleblowing was if they admitted as much, and that the appellant's testimony to the contrary was entitled to no weight. The AJ was free to believe Bolen and Karl over the appellant after performing an explained credibility analysis, <span class="Italic">see Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987), but it was inappropriate for him to suggest to the appellant during her testimony that her testimony on this issue was meaningless. Further, the AJ's questioning of the witnesses may have left the impression that the AJ was acting as an advocate for the agency rather than as an impartial decision maker when, for example, he negatively characterized the appellant and her union representative, interrupted the appellant before she had completed her question, misinterpreted what she said, and accused her of making an untrue statement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the totality of the AJ's conduct, and not on any one remark or incident, we find that a reasonable person could have the impression that the AJ allowed his personal feelings and views to have so infected his consideration of this appeal as to create doubts about his ability to impartially resolve close and difficult questions of fact. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of Defense,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 461, 465 (1991). Under the unique circumstances of this appeal, we find that assignment of this appeal to a different AJ is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Muzzipapa v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 53, 60 (1992) (assignment of the appeal to a different AJ on remand was appropriate where the AJ's statements, although not establishing bias, may give the impression that the AJ could not impartially adjudicate the appeal on remand).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without concluding that an AJ exhibited bias, the Board interceded to avoid the appearance of impropriety, <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, 47 MSPR 461, 465 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge included in the initial decision remarks that appear to have been directed at the appellant personally, rather than simply at the merits of the appellant's claim (administrative judge's references to the appellant's "grand-eloquent [sic] posturings" and to his "ranting submissions"). While we recognize that the appellant appears to have made similar statements in describing the administrative judge's fitness to hear his appeal, we note that decision-makers should avoid responding to this kind of criticism by making <span class="Italic">ad hominem</span> attacks. An administrative judge should not allow the impression that his personal feelings have so infected his consideration of a case as to create doubts about his ability to impartially resolve close and difficult questions of fact....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, although we do not find that the administrative judge's remarks show bias, we find that assignment of a different administrative judge to hear this case on remand would be appropriate....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Muzzipapa v. VA</span>, 53 MSPR 53, 59-60 (1992), another appeal resulting in assignment of a different AJ, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also renews his claim made below of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the administrative judge and the appellant. The Board's regulations at 5 CFR 1201.41(c) state that "[T]he parties may agree to waive the prohibitions against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications during settlement discussions...." Absent such a waiver, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> discussions concerning settlement are prohibited. Therefore, we agree with the appellant that, in the absence of a waiver by the parties in this appeal, the administrative judge committed an impermissible <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication by discussing settlement with the appellant and his mother without the presence of the appellant's designated representative and the agency's representative....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also makes a generalized allegation of bias on the administrative judge's part, but that allegation is insufficient to overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that administrative judges enjoy....&#8197;However, without making a finding of bias on the part of the administrative judge, we remand this appeal to the New York Regional Office with instructions to assign it to another administrative judge for a new hearing and adjudication. The record indicates that there is a strained relationship at best between the administrative judge and the appellant's representative. In the appellant's motion, by sworn statement of his representative, to disqualify the administrative judge, the appellant's representative asserts that the administrative judge told the appellant that he would be better off representing himself. The administrative judge describes this remark differently in his order denying the motion to disqualify himself, stating that he advised the appellant that <span class="Italic">pro se</span> representation is better than none.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge suggested that the appellant's representative was forgetful and dilatory in requesting subpoenas for his witnesses, although the record does not substantiate the accusation of forgetfulness. The administrative judge also stated that the agency managed to conform with the short deadline, implying that the appellant should have been able to do the same. However, as we previously noted, the appellant's witnesses were not agency employees and it is quite conceivable that contacting them and scheduling their appearance might present difficulties to the appellant that the agency did not encounter. In fact, the appellant alleges that he advised the administrative judge that he was experiencing such difficulties. Similarly, the administrative judge noted that the appellant was late for the reopened hearing, but the administrative judge failed to mention that the appellant explained his 45-minute lateness. The administrative judge stated that the appellant's failure to submit further evidence or go forward at either hearing "is redolent of a hidden agenda flavoring this case from its inception." These statements, while they may not establish bias on the part of the administrative judge, may give the impression that the administrative judge could not impartially adjudicate this appeal on remand because of his personal animosity for the appellant's representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 47 MSPR 461, 465 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the administrative judge's improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the appellant regarding settlement and representation, while not prejudicial to the appellant's substantive rights, may also give the appearance of partiality on the administrative judge's part.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board assigned an appeal for rehearing to another AJ in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. USDA</span>, 39 MSPR 232, 234-35 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of the motion to disqualify the administrative judge, the appellant's attorney submitted an affidavit recounting his perception of events that transpired at the September 1, 1987 hearing. He states that the administrative judge held an off-the-record discussion with the parties' representatives during the course of the hearing. According to the affidavit, the administrative judge requested that everyone, including the court reporter, leave the room. The administrative judge then inquired whether the agency would give the appellant a clean record, if he resigned and withdrew the appeal; the agency's representative stated that it would and attempted to comment further upon the settlement offer. The appellant's attorney expressed a belief that the appellant would prevail on the law and rejected any settlement offer. The appellant's counsel further asserts in his affidavit that the administrative judge then said that he did not see how he could rule for the appellant, that what he did was too serious, and that he could not take the responsibility of putting the appellant back to work. The appellant's representative replied that several high-ranking officials in the agency had already taken that responsibility. According to the affidavit, the administrative judge then said that he had heard enough of the facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge stated that the discussion should go no further than that room or he would not participate in it further. Again, according to the affidavit, the administrative judge said that he was sympathetic to the appellant's case, but that the agency deciding official, and main witness, was a high-level Republican official and then said to the appellant's attorney words to this effect: What do you think the Chairman of the MSPB is and what do you think the Board will do with this case when it reviews it? The administrative judge then is alleged to have made certain comments that the appellant had lost on the facts and was required to convince the administrative judge on the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency expressed its opposition to the appellant's motion and to the reversal or modification of the initial decision, on grounds related to this matter, it has not disputed the allegations in the appellant's counsel's affidavit. In addition, although the administrative judge referred, in his order denying the motion, to the appellant's "imagined concern that [he] was swayed by political considerations," and stated that partisan politics would not enter into his decision, he has not directly and specifically denied making the kinds of statements attributed to him in the affidavit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as the record stands, there is an unrebutted affidavit from an attorney alleging partiality and unfairness on the part of the administrative judge. These allegations go to the heart of the integrity of the Board, and cannot be ignored. While we do not find that the administrative judge actually made the statements attributed to him in the appellant's representative's affidavit, we find that on the state of the record, there is such an appearance of impropriety that a new adjudication by another administrative judge is warranted. The new administrative judge shall take such additional evidence as is necessary from the parties to resolve the issues raised in the appeal.</p>
