<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-284"><span class="space">a.</span> Analysis of Alleged Discrimination or Reprisal Based on Military Service</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">USERRA coverage for discriminatory acts is for defined appellants and personnel actions, <span class="Italic">Donahue v. Dept. of Labor</span>, PH-1221-17-0103-W-1 (NP 7/19/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Concerning USERRA's anti-discrimination provision, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), the administrative judge found that the appellant's allegations failed because he was not an agency employee or applicant for employment, nor was he denied any benefit of employment. <span class="Italic">See Gossage v. Department of Labor</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 10 (2012) (recognizing that an appellant establishes the Board's jurisdiction over a USERRA discrimination claim by nonfrivolously alleging that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment). Concerning USERRA's anti-retaliation provision, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b), he found that the appellant's allegations failed because they did not involve an adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Kitlinski v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 857 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (recognizing that USERRA's anti-retaliation provision applies only to "acts of discrimination in employment and adverse employment actions...which [are] generally defined to include actions adversely affecting [an] employee's employment status, such as firing, demotion, suspension, a loss of benefits, or a reduction in pay").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hong v. GSA</span>, NY-4324-17-0202-I-1 (NP 1/20/2023), described elements of proof of a USERRA discrimination or hostile environment claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish jurisdiction over a USERRA discrimination claim before the Board, an appellant must nonfrivolously allege that (1) he performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to his performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Beck</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 504, &#x00B6; 8. The Board employs a liberal approach in determining whether an appellant has established the Board's jurisdiction under USERRA, and the relative weakness of an appellant's assertions in support of his claim is not a basis for a jurisdictional dismissal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, if an appellant fails to develop his contentions, his claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once an appellant has established the Board's jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal, he has a right to a hearing on the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">Gossage v. Department of Labor</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 10 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the appellant did not explicitly argue below that his various allegations should be considered together as a whole, we find that it would be appropriate to do so to determine whether he has made a nonfrivolous allegation of a hostile work environment under USERRA. To establish the Board's jurisdiction over a USERRA hostile work environment claim, an appellant must nonfrivolously allege that he was subjected to a pattern of ongoing and persistent harassing behavior based on his military service that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 239 (1996); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Kitlinski v. Department of Justice</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 19 (2015), <span class="Italic">vacated in part on other grounds</span>, 857 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2017).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from such circumstantial evidence as temporal proximity between the appellant's military activity and the adverse employment action, "inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the [individual's] military activity, and disparate treatment of certain [individuals] compared to other [individuals] with similar work records or offenses." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the administrative judge also found, USERRA discrimination claims are analyzed under a burden-shifting mechanism: An employee who claims discrimination under USERRA bears the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action. If the employee makes that showing, the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating, as an affirmative defense, that it would have taken the same action without regard to the employee's military service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). An employer therefore violates 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 only if it would not have taken the adverse employment action but for the employee's military service or obligation. <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009). An essential element of a discrimination claim is that the contested agency decision was based on an improper motivation. <span class="Italic">Clavin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be established by direct evidence or reasonably inferred from a variety of factors.<span class="Italic"> See Swidecki v.

Those factors include proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by USERRA together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, the Navy argues on appeal that the Board's decision should be affirmed on the alternate ground that the USERRA does not extend to acts of discrimination against a service member based on military <span class="Italic">rank</span> or <span class="Italic">status</span> in the uniformed services.[11] We decline the Navy's invitation to hold that an individual's military rank falls outside the gamut of potential classifications protected under the USERRA.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the administrative judge found, the appellant did not make a showing that his military service was a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's decision not to select him for the position. Although the appellant argues that he was the best qualified for the position, the Board's function in a USERRA appeal is not to determine whether the agency chose the best applicant but rather to determine whether the appellant has proven that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his prior military experience. <span class="Italic">See Becwar v.

<p class="Body-Text">USERRA liability depends on discrimination based upon military service; not every connection between a personnel action and military status states a USERRA claim. In <span class="Italic">Roll v. USPS</span>, 78 Fed. Appx. 121, 123 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), a delay in hiring the appellant occurred because of the length of time it took for the agency to complete its inquiry relative to the conditions of the appellant's discharge from the military. The court determined that the delay, a consequence of an inquiry into the appellant's military status, did not constitute discrimination against an individual because of his service in the uniformed services:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_477"></span>...In this case, Mr. Roll can point to no act of discrimination taken against him by the agency because of his military service. He was treated just as any other applicant; he was subjected to a background check; the background check took some time. Mr. Roll seeks to gain back pay for the time of the delay in his hiring on the theory that his service in the military was the reason for the delay in his hiring. As the Board pointed out, it may be that his service in the military (service that resulted in his less-than-honorable discharge) led the agency to inquire of the reasons for his particular discharge status, but even so he can point to no discrimination in the steps taken by the agency to understand the reason for his discharge status. Under Mr. Roll's view of USERRA, any connection to the military is enough to force an agency to make amends for a veteran's loss of a "benefit of employment." Thus, under his view, a person who is dishonorably discharged for, say, treason, without more could not be denied a "benefit of employment" under USERRA. We disagree. The law only prevents discrimination on account of military service. Because Mr. Roll can point to no such discrimination, the Board committed no error in dismissing his case, and we therefore affirm the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction between actions resulting from military service or status and action based on misconduct during military service was explained by <span class="Italic">Jennings v. SSA</span>, AT-4324-11-0442-B-1 (NP 4/10/2023) (action based on receipt of dual compensation):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In USERRA actions, there must be an initial showing by the employee, by preponderant evidence, that the employee's military status or performance of service was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's action, upon which the agency must prove, also by preponderant evidence, that the action would have been taken for a valid reason despite the protected status or service. <span class="Italic">Strausbaugh v.

The factual question of discriminatory motivation or intent may be proven by direct or circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. Direct evidence of discrimination may be any statement made by an employer that reflects directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and bears directly on the contested employment decision. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9 (2002). By contrast, circumstantial evidence of discriminatory motivation under USERRA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[M]ay be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors, including proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.</p>

"In determining whether the employee has proven that his protected status or activity was part of the motivation for the agency's conduct, all record evidence may be considered, including the agency's explanation for the actions taken." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant does not claim that performance in a uniformed service or an obligation to perform such service accounted for the agency's action, but instead claims that the action resulted from "something that happened during their service," the appellant has not raised a claim under USERRA, and the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Daniels v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 411, 414-115 (1998). Thus, the Board has applied this reasoning to a claim that the agency terminated a probationer due to certain abilities acquired as a result of military service, <span class="Italic">Daniels</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 5, and to a claim that the agency denied initial employment based on a disability arising out of performance of military service, <span class="Italic">McBride</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 415.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has similarly held that USERRA does not prohibit an employer from taking action against an employee for gratuitous misconduct in the course of performing military duties, such as terminating an employee for doing Naval Reserve business at work in violation of company policy. <span class="Italic">McMillan</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 17. Thus, the employment protection under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 is based upon the employee's compliance with the reasonable and ordinarily accepted standards of personal conduct and performance of all employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To the extent an appellant may violate those standards, and is not required to do so by his military orders, his activity is not protected under section 4311(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Strausbaugh v. GPO</span>, 117 MSPR 566, 570 &#x00B6; 12, 2012 MSPB 44 (2012) ("USERRA, however, only prevents discrimination on account of service in the military; it does not prohibit an agency from considering events which occur during an employee's service. <span class="Italic">See Daniels v.

Acceptance of the appellant's position would result in an agency having to disregard misconduct, however egregious, if it occurred during an employee's military service. Nothing in USERRA requires such a result. Therefore, although there is no dispute that the conduct at issue occurred while the appellant was on active military duty status, it does not follow that the agency's decision to terminate him for that conduct establishes that its decision was motivated by his military status.").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a) sets forth the purposes of USERRA, one of which is "to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(3). In furtherance of that aim,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a] person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation to perform service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below that a disproportionate number of lower-scoring nonveterans, as compared to higher-scoring veterans, were selected for the ALJ positions, and that this anomaly was due to discrimination based on veteran status. He stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[V]eterans numbered 43 of the 63 persons from which selections were made, and they compromised 18 of the 20 highest ranking candidates (90 percent), 27 of the 30 highest ranking candidates (90 percent), 34 of the 40 highest ranking candidates (85 percent), and 39 of the 50 highest ranking candidates participating in the selection process, or 78 percent overall. One might expect that an impressive percentage of veterans would be selected, given such data. However, of 43 veterans who participated, only 24, or <span class="Italic">55.8 percent</span>, were actually selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In contrast to the number of veterans, non-veterans numbered only 20 of the 63 candidates from which ALJs were selected, including 2 of the 20 highest ranking (10 percent), 3 of the 30 highest ranking (10 percent), 6 of the 40 highest ranking (15 percent), and 11 of the 50 highest ranking candidates who participated (22 percent). With such low numbers, and given the above-cited Rule of Three, one would not expect a large number of non-veterans to be selected. Nevertheless, some 14 were selected as ALJs, or <span class="Italic">70 percent</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Among the 63 candidates from whom selections were made, there were 8 women candidates, or some 13 percent. In its selections, however, the agency managed to appoint 6 women as ALJs or <span class="Italic">75 percent</span>. [footnotes omitted from quotation]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not disputed these statistics other than emphasizing that, of the 38 candidates selected, 24 of the candidates selected or 63 percent were preference-eligible veterans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued that these results showed a disproportionate selection of non-preference eligibles with lower scores that "can be explained only by the agency's intentional disregard or willful indifference to veterans' preference rights, as well as discrimination based on veteran status<span class="Italic">.</span>" The agency, as discussed above, claimed that it properly accorded veterans all of their preference rights, and that the selecting officials decided which positions and in what sequences it would fill by considering such factors as the relative need for an ALJ at a particular location, whether any incumbent ALJs had requested transfers or reassignments governed by their union contract, retirements, and space availability. The agency further argued that the decision to fill positions in certain locations and the sequence within which to fill them was within the agency's discretion. The AJ erred in not addressing this argument. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an ID must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the AJ's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests). Therefore, we will address this USERRA claim now because there is no dispute of material facts that would require a hearing and the appellant received appropriate notice of the burdens and methods of proof as to this claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.13(b); <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 3 n.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not submitted any direct or circumstantial evidence[9] of a discriminatory motive based on his veteran status on behalf of the selection officials who did not select him for an ALJ position. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009,<span class="Italic"></span> 1012-15 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In fact, the agency considered the appellant for three selections in part because of his veteran status, and veterans were chosen for those positions instead of the appellant. The AJ informed the appellant of the availability of discovery and the procedure for initiating discovery, but nothing in the record indicates that the appellant attempted to engage in discovery before the Board. We thus find that the appellant has failed to prove that he was not selected for an ALJ position due to his veteran status. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 12. In addition, to the extent that the appellant is merely attempting to reassert the identical claims of veterans' preference violations that he raised under VEOA without specifically alleging discrimination based on the appellant's veteran status by renaming them USERRA discrimination claims, he may not do so, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a), (e)(2) (a preference eligible may not pursue a claim of violation of a veterans' preference statute or regulation through the administrative process described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a, while also pursuing at the same time a claim for this same violation under any other law, rule, or regulation); <span class="Italic">cf. Sears v.

Accordingly, we deny the appellant's request for relief under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Circumstantial evidence of a discriminatory motive in a USERRA discrimination claim may include: proximity in time between the employee's military activity and adverse employment action; inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer; an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity; and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009,<span class="Italic"></span> 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

<p class="Body-Text">More extensive analysis of discrimination concerning a selection challenged under USERRA is presented in <span class="Italic">DeJohn v. Dept. of Army</span>, 106 MSPR 574, 575-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-18, 2007 MSPB 215 (2007), determining that no assumptions will be made as to the selection preferences of military organizations and directing AJs to avoid injecting their personal opinions into credibility analyses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). He asserted that the agency discriminated against him in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 when it failed to select him for a GS-11 Historian position at the Army Heritage and Education Center (AHEC), Carlisle, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) held a hearing on the appeal and issued an ID finding as follows: The appellant applied for the Historian position under vacancy announcement no. DQU400646 (delegated examining unit announcement or external announcement). The position was also advertised via merit promotion announcement no. NEDQ04670333 (resumix or internal announcement), which was open, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to all career and career-conditional Federal employees, applicants eligible under special appointing authorities, and applicants eligible under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act. The appellant was referred through the external announcement; awarded 5 additional points based on his veteran status; and, thus, given a score of 103, which ranked him number 1 on the external list (DEU certificate list or Certificate of Eligibles). Douglas Murphy, a non-veteran, was ranked below the appellant with a score of 100. Murphy, however, had also applied for the position under the internal announcement. Thomas Hendrix, Chief, Historical Services Division, Military History Institute, AHEC, selected Murphy from the internal list, but Murphy declined the job. Hendrix canceled the recruiting action in its entirety without making another selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ denied the appellant's request for corrective action under USERRA. The AJ found it undisputed that the appellant had performed duty in a uniformed service and that the agency did not select him for the position. The AJ further found, however, that the appellant failed to show that his nonselection was based on his prior military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a PFR of the ID. The agency has filed a response opposing the PFR. After the record closed on review, the appellant replied to the agency's response and the agency responded to the reply. We have not considered the latter two documents because the parties have not shown that they are based on evidence that was not readily available before the record closed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a discrimination appeal brought under USERRA, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that his military status was a substantial <span id="Page_479"></span>or motivating factor in the agency action. The appellant may satisfy his burden of proof by direct or circumstantial evidence. All record evidence may be considered, including the agency's explanation for the action taken. Once an appellant has met his burden of proof, the burden shifts to the agency to show, by preponderant evidence, that it would have taken the action despite the appellant's protected status. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1013-14 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found, in essence, that the appellant failed to satisfy his burden of proof. In that regard, the AJ found "a dearth of evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, establishing that...Hendrix[ ] ...harbored a discriminatory animus against the appellant because of his military service and thus did not select him for the Historian position." The AJ found that the evidence showed that Hendrix, himself a veteran, "has routinely hired veterans for positions within his organization." The AJ found that all of the witnesses testified that Hendrix "never exhibited, in word or deed, any animosity toward veterans."<span class="Italic"></span> The AJ found that, when Hendrix testified that he did not discriminate against the appellant based upon his military service, his testimony was "believable." The AJ found that Hendrix's testimony was "straightforward and candid" and stated that he "could discern no bias on his part."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ acknowledged the appellant's argument that the evidence showed that the agency engaged in what the appellant described as an "underhanded gaming of the system" because managers commonly used internal lists to avoid highly-ranked veterans who appeared on external lists. The AJ found, though, that if Hendrix truly wanted to avoid picking a highly-ranked veteran from an external list, he could have issued only an internal announcement. The AJ cited Hendrix's explanation that he had the position advertised both internally and externally to get a broader range of candidates, but that his practice was to choose from the internal list first if a good candidate was available. The AJ also noted that the appellant could have applied for the Historian position under the internal announcement, but, for "some inexplicable reason" did not do so. The AJ concluded that Hendrix's decision to select Murphy for the Historian position using another appointment authority did not establish that he did so because of the appellant's military service. The AJ also stated that he found it "extremely hard to believe that an agency that supports the military and is made up, in good measure, [of] veterans, would discriminate against applicants based on their military service." We have granted the appellant's PFR to address shortcomings in the ID's analysis of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that the AJ erred to the extent that he implied that the appellant's USERRA claim was weakened by his failure to apply for the Historian position under the internal announcement. The AJ commented that the appellant's failure to do so was "inexplicable." It appears, however, that the appellant simply did not understand that he could apply under the internal announcement. Further, nothing indicates that Hendrix would have viewed the appellant as a better candidate than Murphy if his name had appeared on the internal list because points are not awarded on the internal list, and, thus, the applicants are not scored. In any event, the appellant's failure to apply under the internal announcement is immaterial in this case in determining whether he proved by preponderant evidence that his military status was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we find that the AJ erred to the extent that he implied that the appellant's USERRA claim should be subjected to a higher standard because it was brought against the Department of the Army, an agency that "supports the military" and is "made up, in good measure, [of] veterans." In that regard, the appellant argues that the AJ improperly injected his own opinion into the fact-finding process. We find that the AJ's remark does not evidence the sort of "deep-seated antagonism or favoritism" that would support a finding of AJ bias. <span class="Italic">See Bieber v. Department of the Army,</span> 287 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002). We expressly reject the notion, however, that an appellant's discrimination claim under USERRA brought against a civilian component of the armed forces is subjected to a higher standard than one brought against some other agency, such as the Department of Commerce or the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, we find shortcomings in the AJ's determination that Hendrix's testimony was "believable" and "straightforward." The Board must give deference to an AJ's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing. The Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Sufficiently sound reasons for overturning an AJ's demeanor-based credibility determinations include circumstances when the AJ's findings are incomplete, inconsistent with the weight of the evidence, and do not reflect the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">Faucher v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 203, &#x00B6; 8 (2004). Based on the analysis set forth below, we find that the record provides sound reasons to overturn the AJ's credibility determination regarding some of Hendrix's hearing testimony. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wallace v. Department of Commerce,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6; 14 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Hendrix's hearing testimony concerning his process for considering internal and external lists was inconsistent. Hendrix testified that, in such a situation, his normal practice is to attempt to fill the position from the internal list first and to turn to the external list if ultimately he is unable to fill the position under the internal list. Here, however, Hendrix did not follow his normal practice. Rather, he canceled the external list, on which the appellant was listed as a veteran and outranked nonveteran Murphy, on May 10, 2004, several weeks <span class="Italic">before,</span> as the evidence indicates, he stated his intention, on June 18, 2004, to offer the Historian position to Murphy under the internal list. Hendrix testified that, on May 10, 2004, when he stated that he would make the selection from the internal (resumix) list, it was probably his intention to hire Murphy from the internal list. He did not clearly explain his failure to follow his normal procedure, however, considering that he apparently did not formally select Murphy before he canceled the external list. In that regard, Hendrix testified that he did not interview the appellant for the position or contact his references. Given that the appellant outranked Murphy and all other candidates on the external list, Hendrix did not clearly explain why he canceled the external list before knowing whether Murphy would accept the position and without interviewing the appellant or the other candidates on the external list.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the inconsistencies in Hendrix's hearing testimony concerning his process for considering the internal and external lists, however, we find that the appellant has failed to prove by preponderant evidence that his military status was a substantial or motivating factor in his non-selection for the Historian position. As previously noted, in making this determination, all record evidence may be considered, including the agency's explanation for the action taken. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan,</span> 240 F.3d at 1014. Here, the appellant chose to make Hendrix's deposition a part of the record. Hendrix's deposition testimony sheds more light on his reasons for using the internal list, for canceling the external list before formally selecting Murphy, and for canceling the recruitment action entirely after Murphy declined the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, Hendrix's deposition testimony indicates that he preferred to use internal lists to hire applicants with previous government service. Hendrix testified that "the internal list provides you people who are in the government service, people who have jobs in the job series that align with the positions that are available or that are associated," who have "grade experience," and "whose experiences and job descriptions are in the ballpark for considering them for work here." He testified that "[p]eople in the government service, job classifications are standardized, grades are standardized, job descriptions are standardized. That stuff leaks over into the resumes.... That's a lot more tangible and substantive." He further testified, "Experience has just shown that's your high payoff.... Again, similar job descriptions, Civil Service grades, series descriptions, all these things, and that's--so that's what we usually do and that's what we did in this case." Similarly, Hendrix testified at the Board hearing that he used the internal list because he generally found that using internal lists gave the agency people who are working often in civil service for the National Park System; there is more consistency in terms of levels of responsibility and the kind of work they are doing, and that they have found civil service employees "perfectly satisfactory." [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee, e.g., Rackers v. Department of Justice,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 262, 281 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 194 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table); <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Department of Transportation,</span> 9 M.S.P.R. 195, 198 (1981) (an AJ is not required to discredit a witness' testimony on all issues once that testimony is discredited on one or more issues). Hendrix testified that Murphy was in fact a Park Service employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hendrix's deposition testimony further indicates why he canceled the external list before he had formally selected Murphy and canceled the recruitment action entirely when Murphy declined the position. Hendrix testified that he looked at the resumes on the external list, but did not see the experience that he wanted, noting that he looked for words like "archivist, service as an historian, oral history, outreach programs, things like that." Instead, he quickly decided that he wanted to offer Murphy the position, even though there was apparently a lag between the time that he made that decision and the actual offer. In that regard, he testified that they were only interested in Murphy, i.e., "Murphy was our man." "[W]e decided Murphy was our person, so that's who we went for. Boom. Don't need the external list." Similarly, Hendrix testified at the Board hearing that Murphy was the applicant that they felt was the best qualified, that he was informed somewhere around June 24, 2004, that Murphy had turned down the position; that the certificate was due to expire on June 24, 2004; and, thus, that he did not want to rush into making another selection. That testimony is consistent with Human Resources Specialist Rhonda Newcomer's testimony that the external certificate had expired or would shortly expire by the time that Murphy declined the position. She further testified that, although she informed Hendrix that he could still look at the internal list, he decided to close the action and reannounce the vacancy later. Other evidence of record, specifically, June 22-24, 2004 e-mails between Murphy and Hendrix, shows that Murphy declined the position because of the cost of moving from Texas to Pennsylvania and <span id="Page_480"></span>that Hendrix informed him that he intended to re-advertise the position to include payment for moving costs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this evidence may indicate that Hendrix did not follow consistent or proper procedures in considering the applicants, the issue in this USERRA case is whether he discriminated against the appellant based on the appellant's military status. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fedder v. Department of the Interior,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 8 (2006) (stating that the Board's role in a USERRA case is not to determine whether the appellant should have been selected for the position, but to determine whether the agency's decision was based on discrimination because of the appellant's military service). The evidence does not show that he did. Hendrix testified at his deposition that he had hired seven people; that five veterans work for him; and that he had hired four veterans, some of whom did not have prior civil service experience. Significantly, Hendrix testified that it would not be appropriate to select a non-veteran from an internal list if the non-veteran was ranked lower than a veteran on the external list and the motivating factor for making that selection from the internal list was to discriminate against the veteran. Similarly, at the Board hearing, Hendrix testified that he has hired veterans, and that he has not used the internal list for the purpose of avoiding a veteran on the external list<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Senior Human Resources Specialist Jennifer Brooks, who oversees recruitment and placement for agency civilian positions, testified that Hendrix never expressed a desire not to hire a veteran in connection with this position. Likewise, Newcomer testified that she was not aware of any complaints against Hendrix for using an internal list to avoid hiring a veteran. She further testified that about 20 of about 55 AHEC employees are veterans. Further, former Civilian Personnel Officer Gerry Silverberg testified that Hendrix had never expressed to him any animosity towards veterans and that he was not aware of any intent by Hendrix to avoid hiring veterans. Moreover, Administrative Officer Luis E. MoraArroio testified that he was not aware of any policies at the AHEC to avoid hiring veterans, that he did not believe that there was any discrimination against the appellant because of his military status, that he did not believe that Hendrix held any animosity toward veterans, and that he did not believe that Hendrix discriminated against the appellant in this hiring action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant has failed to show by preponderant evidence that his military status was a substantial or motivating factor in his non-selection for the Historian position.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant asserts that the AJ erred in finding unpersuasive his statistical evidence concerning the agency's failure to hire veterans after the AJ had denied his motion to compel, which had sought that evidence. The record does not show, however, that the appellant preserved an objection to the AJ's discovery ruling. Thus, the Board does not need to consider the appellant's assertion on review.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Langford v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 129, 138 (1997).</p>

We see no reason to disturb the Board's determination that HRSA's subject matter experts credibly testified that they did not consider Mr. Jones's military service or his prior USERRA claims in their decision that he was not qualified for the position. We also see no error in the Board's determination that HRSA's experts credibly testified that they were unaware of any hostility toward military service members within HHS.

<p class="Body-Text">The agency's selection of a veteran for a position may have some weight as circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Dept. of Army,</span> SF-4324-12-0050-I-1 (NP 8/21/2012) ("The appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly considered Barton McPeak's military service in his consideration of the appellant's Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333) (USERRA) appeal. That the agency selected a veteran for the position is relevant to the analysis of whether the appellant was discriminated against on the basis of his military service, and the administrative judge's findings on this issue did not serve as a comparison between Mr. McPeak's military service and the appellant's military service."). If all the competitors and the selectee were veterans (preference eligibles), the selection of one rather than another veteran is not going to establish USERRA discrimination, in the absence of other proof, <span class="Italic">Lodge v. EEOC</span>, 389 Fed. Appx. 993, 996 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lodge's sole discrimination allegation relating to military service is that Cook was not eligible for veterans' preference based on her employment status with the Agency. We disagree. The record shows that the EEOC conducted an open competition to fill the Program Assistant position and that Cook applied for the position via the open competition. Under an open competitive process, all veterans are given the benefit of their veterans' preference points, including veterans currently employed by the hiring agency. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Fed. Trade Comm'n</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, 58-59 (2005). Contrary to Lodge's assertion, the EEOC's simultaneous announcement of the position for merit promotion, which under <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is not subject to veterans' preference, 247 F.3d at 1224, did not alter Cook's entitlement to veterans' preference in the open competitive process. The entitlement is based on the hiring method used by the Agency, not the employment status of the applicant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless, Lodge's claim fails to establish that the EEOC did not select him for the position based on his military service. The Board rejected Lodge's discrimination claim based in part on the fact that all the applicants on the list of eligible candidates were preference-eligible veterans and that Cook, like Lodge, had a history of military service. As such, the Board held that Lodge had failed to establish that the Agency was motivated not to hire him based on his military service. We find no error in that decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wheeler v. DOD,</span> CH-4324-10-0245-I-1 (NP 3/25/2011), discerned no discrimination in a selection process that evaluated candidates on qualifications in accordance with OPM criteria rather than upon prior military rank and determined there was no error when the AJ considered the length of time that passed between military service and a selection as one factor in evaluating possible discriminatory animus:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues on review that because he retired from the Air Force with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, he necessarily qualified for civilian positions at the level of GS-14 or YC-03. As the administrative judge noted, an agency staffing specialist testified that in evaluating job applicants the agency does not compare civilian grades with a particular rank in the military, but rather considers the experience described in the applicant's resume. Such an approach is consistent with the Office of Personnel Management's Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions. The DoD Financial Management Regulation's conversion chart cited by the appellant is used for determining the cost of military personnel assigned to activities financed by a Defense Working Capital Fund and does not support the appellant's assertion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that the administrative judge erred in considering, as a factor weighing against support for his claim of discrimination under USERRA, the fact that considerable time had elapsed between his military service and the actions of which he complains. In fact, proximity of time is an appropriate factor for consideration in determining whether discriminatory motive may be reasonably inferred. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001). That the Board has found that an individual whose military service predated the complained of nonselections by 30 years raised a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under USERRA, <span class="Italic">see Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 10 (2009), does not provide support for the appellant's claim that the factor is inappropriate for consideration in an appeal on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No USERRA violation resulted from removal for conduct that the appellant asserted was harsher than that imposed upon individuals with no military service, <span class="Italic">Kegler v. USPS,</span> DA-4324-09-0422-I-1 (NP 10/1/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency discriminated against him based on military service in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) when it removed him based on a charge of absence without leave (AWOL) for a time period during which he was incarcerated. He alleges that the agency treated him differently than a number of similarly situated non-preference eligible employees for similar conduct. In order to prevail in his case, he must make an initial showing that it is more likely true than not true that his military service was at least a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's decision to remove him. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_481"></span>In particular, the appellant contends, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency charged him with AWOL for a time during which he was incarcerated whereas it did not charge four non-preference eligible employees AWOL when they were incarcerated. Even assuming that this is true, the appellant failed to meet his burden of proving that the four employees were similarly situated, because he failed to produce sufficient evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding the decision to grant leave to other incarcerated employees, and it appears that they did not have the same record of poor attendance as he had.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the agency was required to offer him an attendance review to give him an opportunity to improve his attendance before disciplining him, and that the agency failed to do this in his case but it offered two non-preference eligible employees attendance reviews before disciplining them. Again, even if this is true, there is no evidence that the reason the agency did not offer the appellant an attendance review was his status as a preference eligible veteran. Moreover, it appears that the purpose of the attendance review is to afford an employee the opportunity to correct his behavior, and the record reflects that the appellant had several opportunities to do so when he was disciplined for attendance deficiencies in the past.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further contends that the agency's presiding labor relations official did not offer him a last-chance settlement agreement during the grievance process but it did offer a last-chance settlement agreement to five non-preference eligible employees who engaged in attendance-related misconduct. However, he introduced no evidence showing that the reason that the agency did not offer him a last-chance settlement agreement was his military service. Also, the appellant introduced no evidence that the comparison employees had records of poor attendance similar to his record. Because the same presiding official unilaterally reduced the appellant's earlier proposed removal to a 14-day suspension a mere seven months before the agency proposed his removal in this case, there is no indication that she harbored any discriminatory animus towards the appellant because of his status as a preference eligible veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's supervisor and the deciding official were both aware of the appellant's veteran status, both men testified that the appellant's status as a veteran did not influence their decisions, and the administrative judge found their testimony to be credible and uncontradicted. The deciding official testified that he was a Vietnam war veteran himself and he considered the appellant's veteran's status to be a mitigating factor in the appellant's favor. Under these circumstances, while the appellant's evidence of disparate treatment standing alone arguably supports a very weak suggestion that his military service might have been a factor in the agency's removal decision, the record as a whole fully supports the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's military service was not a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's decision to remove him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. USDA</span>, DC-4324-15-0636-B-1 (NP 10/31/2022), did not require an agency to demonstrate that is termination of a probationer was justified when the appellant asserted bias against him by reason of his military service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues generally that the agency lacked a valid basis for terminating her during probation. However, the USERRA statute does not confer jurisdiction on the Board to address an agency's underlying personnel action when, as here, the merits of that action are not otherwise appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 131, &#x00B6; 13 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wooten v. VA</span>, 102 MSPR 131, 2006 MSPB 136 (2006), a nonselection case cited in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, explained that USERRA does not make a nonselection appealable to the Board; instead the Board is to determine if military service was a motivating factor in the agency's decision. From that, the Board reasoned that the Board lacked jurisdiction to address the underlying personnel action "where the merits of that action are not otherwise appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Wooten</span>, at &#x00B6; 13. The reasoning in <span class="Italic">Wooten</span> makes little sense. Assuming nonfrivolous allegations of discriminatory motivation for a challenged action, consideration of the reasons offered for that action should be relevant. Consider the case of a removal challenged as retaliatory under the whistleblower laws. The question is motivation, and part of the motivational analysis goes to consideration of the strength of the agency's reasons for taking the action. [Refer to Chapter 13 for discussion of whistleblower cases and motivational analysis.]</p>
