<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-364"><span class="space">b.</span> Time-In-Grade</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 223, 245 &#x00B6; 33, 2007 MSPB 53 (2007) (overruled as to VEOA right compete claim for merit promotion positions sought by federal employees, <span class="Italic">Oram v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2022 MSPB 30 (2022)), if a position is filled through merit promotion, time-in-grade requirements may be applied without violating VEOA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as discussed previously, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, &#x00B6; 4 n.3, the record does not establish that the appellant met the time-in-grade requirements necessary to qualify for the position, and, while the VEOA guarantees preference eligibles and certain non-preference eligible veterans the right to compete for particular positions, it does not exempt them from the eligibility criteria, such as time-in-grade restrictions, that are applicable to all candidates. <span class="Italic">See Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). Because the record is insufficient to establish whether the appellant would have been qualified for the GS-14 Assistant Chief of Staff (Program Management) position at the time the agency should have considered his application, the appropriate remedy is to order the agency to determine whether the appellant was qualified for the position, and, if he is found qualified, to reconstruct the selection process for the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">Jolley</span>, 2007 MSPB 51, &#x00B6; 21; <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Time-in-grade requirements were applied to a merit promotion selection when the applicant, who was not a federal employee, previously held a federal position, <span class="Italic">Asatov v. DOJ</span>, PH-3330-12-0305-I-1 (NP 8/9/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, the appellant essentially argued below and he reasserts on review, that a veteran's application should not be subject to basic qualification standards, which he contends prevents him from competing with the other applicants. The appellant appears to argue that, under the VEOA and given his status as a veteran, merely applying for a position qualifies him for a placement on the certification/eligible list and entitles him to evaluation by the hiring official or panel. However, the Board explicitly rejected this argument in <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98 (2000). The Board specifically found that the VEOA only prohibits an agency from denying a preference eligible or veteran the opportunity to compete; it does not provide that veterans will be considered eligible for positions for which they are not qualified. <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9. The Board found further that, because the VEOA is not a noncompetitive-entry authority, like the Veterans Readjustment Act (VRA), it does not exempt veterans from the eligibility criteria such as time-in-grade restrictions that would be applicable to all candidates. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f). In enacting the VEOA, Congress specified that agencies would apply merit system principles in accepting applications from individuals outside its own workforce. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; Sec. 2, Pub. L. 105-339. Merit system principles require that recruitment of federal employees should be from "qualified individuals." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1). Contrary to the appellant's assertions, VEOA did not exempt him, as a covered veteran, from meeting minimum qualification standards in order to compete for vacant positions under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find no merit to the appellant's argument that the agency's ineligible rating for him was based on its "unreasonable interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.603 requirements." Specifically, the appellant argues that time-in-grade restrictions do not apply to him because he was not a federal employee at the time of his application for the Paralegal Specialist position. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.603(a), time-in-grade restrictions "applies to advancement to a General Schedule position in the competitive service by any individual who within the previous 52 weeks held a General Schedule position under nontemporary appointment in the competitive or excepted service in the executive branch." Here, while the appellant was not a federal employee during the January 30, 2012 to February 10, 2012 open period when he applied for the Paralegal Specialist position, the appellant was previously employed as an Economic Assistant, GS-05, with DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics until he resigned effective July 19, 2011, during his probationary period. Accordingly, because the appellant held a General Schedule position under a nontemporary appointment in the competitive service approximately 24-28 weeks prior to submitting his application for the Paralegal Specialist position, the time-in-grade restrictions clearly apply to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.603.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another challenge was to time-in-grade requirements was rejected, <span class="Italic">Asatov v. OPM</span>, CB-1205-15-0036-U-1 (NP 3/9/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner argues that the regulation's coverage only should apply only to current employees and that its inclusion of recent former employees like himself requires a violation of veterans' preference requirements. However, he has not identified any authority for the proposition that the regulation should apply only to current employees or any law that excludes from the regulation's coverage former employees with veterans' preference. The statutes that the petitioner cites, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3313 and 3317, do not address time-in-grade restrictions, and he has offered no rationale for excluding the application of this neutral eligibility restriction to preference-eligible individuals. As OPM pointed out in its response to the petitioner's request, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has upheld the time-in-grade restrictions as <span class="Italic">per se</span> valid and subject only to application challenges in its decision in <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d 720, 724 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The court upheld the regulation on the basis of its stated purpose of avoiding the management problems that would result from excessively rapid promotions within the work force. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 721. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.601 ("The restrictions in this subpart are intended to prevent excessively rapid promotions in competitive service General Schedule positions and to protect competitive principles."). While violation of veterans' preference rights was not at issue in <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>, the Board previously has rejected the petitioner's facial challenge to section 300.603(a) on this basis in <span class="Italic">Asatov v. Department of Justice,</span> MSPB Docket No. PH-330-12-0305-I-1, Final Order (Aug. 9, 2013).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roach v. DOJ</span>, DA-3330-15-0610-I-1 (NP 11/17/2016) (We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant lacked the sufficient time-in-grade. The appellant's time working as an acting manager at the GS-13 level cannot be credited for purposes of the time-in-grade requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R.&#x00A7; 300.605(a) (stating that service while on detail is credited at the grade of the employee's position of record, not the grade of the position to which detailed).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Time-in-grade requirements were reviewed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kerner v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 778 F.3d 1336, 1336-39 (Fed. Cir. 2015), concluding that 5 USC 3304(f) and 3311 do not require a federal agency to consider non-federal civil service experience when determining whether a veteran employed in the federal civil service meets a time-in-grade requirement for merit promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Edward Kerner applied for two merit-promotion vacancies at his employing agency, the Department of the Interior, but his applications were rejected because he did not meet the time-in-grade requirements necessary to be considered for the positions. He now claims that the agency violated the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act (VEOA) by not crediting his military and non-federal service when determining whether he met the time-in-grade requirements. But the provisions on which Mr. Kerner relies only apply to preference-eligible veterans not already employed in the federal civil service, not to current federal employees seeking merit promotions. Accordingly, we affirm the Merit Systems Protection Board's final decision denying Mr. Kerner's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2010, while Mr. Kerner was an Evidence Custodian, GS-05, with the Department's Fish and Wildlife Service, he applied for two vacancies within the Department: Wildlife Inspector, GS-09/11, and Wildlife Inspector, GS-11/11. Both positions were merit-promotion vacancies. Each required federal employee applicants to meet a time-in-grade requirement. A federal civil service applicant must have completed at least fifty-two weeks of experience equivalent to GS-07 to be qualified for the GS-09 position, and at least fifty-two weeks of experience equivalent to GS-09 to be qualified for the GS-11 position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604. The <span id="Page_685"></span>vacancies also required one year of specialized experience in the federal civil service equivalent to GS-07 or GS-09, respectively. Mr. Kerner had no federal civil service experience at the GS-07 or GS-09 level and, therefore, did not meet the time-in-grade requirements. Accordingly, the Department determined that he did not qualify for either of the Wildlife Inspector vacancies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kerner then filed a VEOA claim with the Department of Labor, alleging that the Department violated his VEOA rights when it removed his applications from consideration for not meeting the time-in-grade requirements. The Department of Labor determined that Mr. Kerner's VEOA rights were not violated, and Mr. Kerner appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Board affirmed. Mr. Kerner appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal agencies generally use two types of selection processes when filling vacancies in the competitive service: open competition and merit promotion. Open competition is used for employees seeking to join the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. FTC</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Merit promotion is "used when the position is to be filled by an employee of the agency or by an applicant from outside the agency who has 'status' in the competitive service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a federal agency posts a merit-promotion vacancy that accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce, preference-eligible veterans "may not be denied the opportunity to compete" for the vacancy. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). It is undisputed that the Wildlife Inspector vacancies at issue here were merit-promotion vacancies that accepted applications from individuals outside the Department's workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kerner argues that the Department violated his VEOA rights under &#x00A7; 3304(f) because it did not credit his non-federal civil service experience under &#x00A7; 3311 when determining whether he met the time-in-grade requirements. Section 3311 reads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In examinations for the competitive service in which experience is an element of qualification, a preference eligible is entitled to credit</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;for service in the armed forces when his employment in a similar vocation to that for which examined was interrupted by the service; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;for all experience material to the position for which examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether he received pay therefor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kerner argues that if the Department had considered all of his experience, it would have found at least fifty-two weeks of non-federal civil service experience equivalent to experience at the GS-07 and GS-09 levels. Thus, according to Mr. Kerner, he would have met the time-in-grade requirements</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kerner's argument assumes that &#x00A7; 3304(f) requires federal agencies to apply &#x00A7; 3311 to merit-promotion vacancies that accept applicants from outside the agency's workforce, even when the applicant is already employed in the federal civil service. The statutory language, the legislative history, and the case law do not support this argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress enacted &#x00A7; 3311 as part of the Veterans' Preference Act, the precursor to the VEOA. Courts have interpreted the Veterans' Preference Act to give preference in a veteran's initial appointment to the federal civil service, but not to an employee's transfer or other intraagency movement, such as promotions. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 247 F.3d 1222, 1224 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("We affirm the proposition established in <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, namely, that veterans are not accorded any preference under the VPA when seeking promotion or intra-agency transfers."); <span class="Italic">see also Bates v. Runyon</span>, 97 F.3d 1464, 1996 WL 532210, at *2 (10th Cir. 1996) ("[J]udicial interpretation clearly establishes that veterans' preference does not apply to an employee's transfer or other intra-agency movement.") (unpublished table decision); <span class="Italic">Glenn v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 939 F.2d 1516, 1523 (11th Cir. 1991) ("[V]eterans' preference only applies to initial employment, not to movement of an incumbent employee from one job to another within an agency."); <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Coleman</span>, 712 F. Supp. 1571, 1581 (N.D. Ga. 1989) ("[N]either the [VPA] nor the...regulations promulgated thereunder accord veterans preferential treatment in promotions."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 901 F.2d 1571 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The text of the VEOA shows that it is intended to assist veterans in gaining access to federal civil service employment, not to give veterans preference in merit promotions. The VEOA's title itself--"Veterans Employment Opportunity Act"--shows that its purpose is to help veterans get the opportunity for federal employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 105-339, 112 Stat 3182. And &#x00A7; 2 of the VEOA, which amended &#x00A7; 3304(f), is titled "Access for Veterans," showing that the VEOA is intended to help veterans gain access to federal employment, not preferential treatment in promotion decisions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at &#x00A7; 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, &#x00A7; 3304(f)(4) states that merit-promotion vacancies accepting applications from outside the agency's workforce must announce that preference-eligible veterans are "eligible to apply." This language shows that Congress intended the VEOA to assist veterans otherwise ineligible to apply. Veterans already employed by the competitive service are already "eligible to apply" to merit-promotion vacancies, and thus cannot be the intended target for &#x00A7; 3304(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the VEOA confirms that Congress did not intend for &#x00A7; 3304 to apply when a veteran or other preference-eligible applicant is already employed in federal civil service. When introducing the original version of the VEOA, Senator Charles Hagel stated that the purpose of the VEOA was to help veterans "<span class="Italic">get and hold</span> jobs with the Federal Government." 143 CONG. REC. 14,682 (1997) (emphasis added). There was no mention of promotion preference for veterans already employed in the competitive service. Indeed, statements show that the VEOA was specifically targeted to veterans not already employed in the federal civil service. <span class="Italic">E.g., id.</span> at 5,258 (statement of Rep. Maloney) "[T]he VEOA opens Federal employment opportunities for individuals honorably discharged from the military...by eliminating artificial barriers which prevent them from competing for Federal jobs <span class="Italic">because they are not already civilian employees or employees of a particular agency</span>.") (emphasis added); 144 CONG. REC. 24,806 (1998), (statement of Rep. Mica) ("Very often,...Federal agencies will only allow current civilian employees to apply for vacancies. <span class="Italic">Veterans who do not work for the Federal Government are barred from even competing on their merits for these jobs. That will change when this legislation is enacted</span>. Under this bill whenever an agency opens the competition to civilian employees outside of its own workforce, it must also allow these qualified veterans to compete.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 24,808 (statement of Rep. Pappas) ("I rise today to support our veterans by calling for the passage of...the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998.... For too long many of our nation's veterans have been neglected by our own government when it comes to <span class="Italic">obtaining federal employment</span>.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of this evidence, we conclude that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f) and 3311 do not require a federal agency to consider non-federal civil service experience when determining whether a veteran employed in the federal civil service meets a time-in-grade requirement for purposes of a merit promotion.</p>
