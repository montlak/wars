<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-221"><span class="space">n.</span> Agreement to "Cancel" Action; Back Pay, Interest, Damages, or Other Entitlement; Bonus or Award; Lump Sum Provision</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">At least before President Trump's Executive Order 13,839 of May 2018 (revoked by President Biden's Executive Order 14,003 (January 22, 2021), <span class="Italic">Protecting the Federal Workforce</span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/27/2021-01924/protecting-the-federal-workforce">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/27/2021-01924/protecting-the-federal-workforce</a>), many settlements included provisions that called for an agency to "cancel" an action, for example, a demotion, suspension, or removal. That Order did not prohibit an agency from canceling an action through settlement, but it considerably reduced the number of cases that will reach that result. The decisions we review predated that Order. In <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 635, 639-43(1991), the question was whether back pay followed as a matter of right upon the agreement to cancel an action. The Board determined it did not: secure back pay enforcement authority under an agreement to cancel an action; there should be a specific agreement calling for back pay or, in lieu of a specific agreement, an obligation to pay back pay readily apparent in a collective bargaining agreement, statute, or regulation. To recover pay under the Back Pay Act, the condition that an action be unjustified or unwarranted must be satisfied. The Board refused to read that condition into the agreement to cancel the action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's contention that the agency has not complied because it has not issued him back pay or restored his leave, we begin with the proposition that "[i]n a suit against the United States, there cannot be a right to money damages without a waiver of sovereign immunity." <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 400 (1976). Thus, we find that the Board's authority to award back pay and restore leave must derive, if at all, from the Back Pay Act, the settlement agreement, or another source, such as a collective bargaining agreement with the agency, that imposes on it the mandatory obligation to award back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), a provision of the Back Pay Act, an employee is entitled to back pay and the restoration of leave benefits only after the finding of an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" by an "appropriate authority," such as the Board. That act has been described as providing for money damages against the government only "in carefully limited circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Testan</span>, 424 U.S. at 404. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.804 (1988); <span class="Italic">Packard v. Department of Transportation</span>, 25 MSPR 404, 407 (1984); <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 24 MSPR 25, 26 (1984); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Army</span>, 21 MSPR 270, 272 (1984). Regulations promulgated under this section authorize an agency to grant back pay if it determines that a personnel action was "unjustified" or "unwarranted." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brees v. Hampton</span>, 877 F.2d 111, 118-19 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 110 S. Ct. 867 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, upon the cancellation of its action, an agency is required under the Back Pay Act to restore an employee as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>.... Further, in such cases, an employee is entitled to receive whatever rights and/or benefits he would have had if the agency's action had not occurred.... The purpose of the cancellation order and the basis for the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy...is "that when a wrong has been done and the law gives a remedy, the compensation shall be equal to the injury." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733 n.3, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Settlement agreements, however, which are strongly favored by public policy, resolve disputes without litigation.... Such agreements in no way imply that the underlying personnel action was unwarranted or unjustified. In this case, the Board finds that the provision in the "last chance" agreement, in which the agency agrees to cancel the removal action after the appellant's successful completion of a two-year probationary period, does not constitute a finding by an "appropriate authority" that the underlying removal action was "unjustified or unwarranted." Similarly, the Board has never made a determination regarding whether the removal action was "unjustified or unwarranted"; in other words, it has not found that "a wrong has been done" for which "the law gives a remedy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above, the Board finds that the appellant has no right to back pay and benefits under the provisions of the Back Pay Act. Additionally, there is nothing in the record, such as a collective bargaining agreement, that would bestow on the appellant a "right" to back pay or other entitlements. Any such entitlements, therefore, would have to derive from the settlement agreement itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have already found that an employee is not entitled to a back pay award based only on the fact that his appeal was settled without an admission of agency liability. Thus, this appeal raises an issue of first impression, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether an employee is entitled to back pay and benefits where, as part of a settlement agreement, the employee's removal is "cancelled," and the employee is reinstated. The pertinent provision of the agreement states that "the removal action will be automatically cancelled."... The resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon the construction that is placed upon the term "cancelled" in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, first, that there is no mention in the agreement of any entitlement of the appellant to the requested back pay and benefits. The appellant, represented by an attorney, could have addressed such concerns in the agreement itself.... There is also no provision in the agreement to the effect that the appellant will be made whole or will suffer no financial loss of any sort as a result of the settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, and the interpretation of its terms is a question of law.... In construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance to determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted. Only if the terms are ambiguous, may parol evidence be considered. <span class="Italic">Miura v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 663, 668 (1989). The Board, however, will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Justice</span>, 37 MSPR 374 (1988); <span class="Italic">Kinney v. Department of the Interior</span>, 30 MSPR 170, 172-73 (1986); <span class="Italic">Hallum v. US Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 214, 215 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 818 F.2d 875 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In addition, the Board lacks authority unilaterally to modify the material terms in a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Colonel v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 285, 291 (1988). Rather, the parties are bound by the terms of their settlement because, before the Board will accept it into the record for enforcement, the Board must find that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the parties understand and freely assent to their agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. US Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 149 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These principles have been demonstrated clearly by our decision in <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 MSPR 594 (1990), in which an appellant who had settled his appeal sought annual and sick leave credit for the period that he received back pay. The Board specifically noted that, "the agency did not cancel its removal action as a result of the outcome of any appeal or administrative determination. Neither did it unilaterally rescind the removal action. Rather, it cancelled the removal action as a result of the parties' settlement agreement."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>, the Board examined the issue of the appellant's entitlement to leave credit under the contract law pertaining to settlement agreements, rather than under the "make whole" provisions of the Back Pay Act. The Board stated that, "[b]ecause the appellant entered the settlement agreement without ensuring that the agreement expressly provided that he would receive annual and sick leave credit, [he], in effect, removed the leave issue from the jurisdiction of the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 599. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, 29 MSPR at 339; <span class="Italic">but see</span> <span class="Italic">Vathke v. Department of the Army</span>, [MSPB Docket No. SE315H90C9026, slip op. at 5-6 (Aug. 7, 1991)] (where a separated employee's entitlement to payment for accrued annual leave was provided by operation of law under 5 USC &#x00A7; 5551(a), the fact that his separation was effected pursuant to a settlement agreement did not alter his entitlement to the lump sum payment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In line with our holding in <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>, and for the reasons discussed in the previous section of this decision, we hold that, for compliance appeals that are filed after the issuance of this decision, we will reject a status-quo-ante analysis of settlement agreement provisions, such as the "cancellation" of a personnel action. Rather, in construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the four corners of the agreement itself shall be examined to determine the parties' intent.... With regard to the term "cancelled" in this case, we note that nothing in the FPM states that the cancellation of a personnel action must result in an award of back pay. Moreover, as we have stated, the Board does not imply a meaning to an unambiguous term of an agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In future cases, therefore, the Board will not imply that the parties have intended an award of back pay and benefits that are not specified for the employee, when they have merely agreed to the "cancellation" of a personnel action in a settlement agreement. The parties are free, within the confines of the law, to settle a case on whatever terms they agree to; thus, the Board will not simply assume that a provision as important as back pay and benefits is subsumed in the absence of their specification of such a term. Because we are announcing this rule prospectively, however, we find that fairness to the parties dictates that we remand this case, so that the parties may inform the Board whether they meant more by the term "cancelled" in their agreement than would otherwise be the case.</p>

The agreement called for the employee to be placed on a leave without pay status for 90 days. After that time period, the employee was to resign. The issue was whether the employee was entitled to payment of accrued annual leave. Payment was a matter of statutory entitlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The entitlement of a separated employee to payment for accrued annual leave is provided by statute:</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Urban v. VA,</span> CH-1221-03-0576-C-1 (NP 10/14/2010), declined to alter or clarify a settlement agreement that placed an employee back to work but that did not cancel the removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that certain terms of the December 15, 2003 settlement agreement, which settled her 2003 removal appeal and individual-right-of-action appeal, are ambiguous. She emphasizes throughout her petition that her intent in signing the settlement agreement was to prevent the removal action and to have it expunged from her personnel file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The terms of the settlement agreement did not cancel or rescind the appellant's 2003 removal. Rather, the settlement agreement simply resolved the appellant's Board appeals, including the appeal of her removal. Specifically, &#x00B6; 4(a) of the agreement provided that the appellant agrees to "[w]ithdraw, rescind and abandon her Merit Systems Protection Board Appeals...." The appellant's removal remained in place, but she was "[r]eturn[ed]...to Federal Service...to the position of Claims Assistant" under the terms of the settlement agreement. The agency had already issued a decision sustaining her proposed removal, which was the subject of her appeal to the Board. Accordingly, &#x00B6; 6(a) of the settlement agreement, providing that all pending actions be dismissed, did not cancel the appellant's 2003 removal or prevent the agency from bringing future disciplinary actions against her. Nor does the settlement agreement prohibit the agency from relying on the 2003 removal as prior discipline in a subsequent disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement uses a term of art, e.g., "back pay," but does not expressly reference the Back Pay Act, the Board (unless there is some other, contrary provision) will read into the agreement the benefits, e.g., back pay, overtime back pay, and interest, provided for by law and regulation. The approach was explained in <span class="Italic">Kellihan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 47, 50-51 (1996), distinguishing <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 635, 642 (1991), as to a settlement that did not attempt to invoke statutory or regulatory entitlements through use of a term of art:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party is entitled to no more than is provided for by the terms of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Keenan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 407, 409 (1995). Further, what the Board enforces in a settlement agreement are the contract terms, not our statutory authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span>, 56 MSPR 311, 315 (1993). However, where the parties use a term of art in a settlement agreement without defining it, the Board will apply the regulatory or statutory definition of that term unless it is shown that the parties intended otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Gannon v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 660 (1995), the settlement agreement provided that "the agency would return the appellant to duty and pay him all back pay, benefits, and entitlements" for certain enumerated time periods, but it did not define "back pay." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 663-65. Under those circumstances, the Board found that because the appellant was a preference-eligible employee to whom the Back Pay Act applied, his "back pay award under the settlement agreement is governed by the Back Pay Act and includes the amount of overtime pay he would have received if the agency had not removed him." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 665. Moreover, because the Board defined the term "back pay" in the settlement agreement by reference to the Back Pay Act, the appellant was also entitled to interest on back pay, as specified in the Act. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 666; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 69 MSPR 268, 271-72 (1996) (where the settlement agreement granted the appellant "priority consideration" but did not define that term, the Board treated the phrase as a "term of art" and applied the definition found in case law and agency regulations absent a contrary intent in the settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement here provides that the agency would cancel the removal action; substitute in its place a thirty-day suspension, effective August 21, 1995; and pay the appellant "backpay for the period from the end of the thirty (30) day suspension to the date of his return to duty." Like the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Gannon</span>, the agreement here does not define "back pay." Because, as in <span class="Italic">Gannon</span>, this appeal involves an employee to whom the Back Pay Act (5 USC &#x00A7; 5596) applies, the provisions of the Act will govern the appellant's entitlement to interest on back pay and overtime back pay unless the settlement agreement reveals a contrary intent. <span class="Italic">See Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 478, 486 (1994) (the provisions of the Back Pay Act apply to employees of the Department of the Navy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued that the appellant is not entitled to interest on his back-pay award because he waived any entitlement to such interest in paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement. Paragraph 8 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except for the terms stated in this agreement, the appellant hereby waives any right to seek any type of relief and/or damages, including but not limited to claims for back pay, separation pay, interest payment or attorney fees, in connection with any matter relating to, arising out of, or resulting from the facts and circumstances surrounding the captioned appeal. The Appellant hereby agrees not to bring any of these matters in or before any person, court, board, commission, or other administrative or judicial forum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If paragraph 8 precludes the payment of the items listed therein, as the agency's argument suggests, then the appellant would not be entitled to any back pay, which is an item listed in paragraph 8, even though he is entitled to back pay under the express terms of paragraph 3. Moreover, because the Back Pay Act states that an amount payable under its terms "shall be payable with interest," 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b) (2) (A), and because the term "back pay" in paragraph 3 of the settlement agreement incorporates the interest provisions of the Act, paragraph 8 means simply that the appellant waived any right to seek further interest. Thus, we find that paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement does not preclude the payment of interest on the back-pay award to which the appellant is entitled under the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See generally Beard v. Department of Defense</span>, 57 MSPR 355, 357 (1993) ("In construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement are of paramount importance to determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discerning nothing in the settlement agreement to the contrary, we follow <span class="Italic">Gannon</span> and find that the appellant's back-pay award under the agreement is governed by the provisions of the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">. See</span> 67 MSPR at 665. Hence, the appellant is entitled under the settlement agreement to overtime back pay and interest on back pay in accordance with the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As for whether the settlement agreement provides for payment of interest on back pay, the administrative judge found that the terms of the agreement do not include interest on the back pay and that there was no basis to infer that the agency committed "an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action," which is the statutory basis for an award of back pay under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that the agency would "pay back pay for the period October 15, 1995 to February 2, 1998 to be calculated under the provisions of 5 C.F.R. 550.805 within 90 days of the effective date of this agreement." The agreement does not explicitly address the issue of interest on the back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5136"></span>The Board has long held that, when the parties use a term of art like "back pay" in a settlement agreement without defining it, the Board will apply the regulatory or statutory definition of that term, unless the agreement revealed a contrary intent. <span class="Italic">Carter v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 45 &#x00B6; 20 (2001); <span class="Italic">Kellihan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 47, 50 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Kellihan</span>, the Board found that the provisions of the Back Pay Act governed the appellant's entitlement to interest on back pay under the settlement agreement because the appellant was an individual to whom the Act applied and the agreement revealed no contrary intent. <span class="Italic">Kellihan</span>, at 50. Under the provisions of the Back Pay Act, back pay includes interest. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(2). Here, the agency has not disputed that the appellant is covered by the Back Pay Act. The agreement does not define "back pay," other than to reference 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805, a regulation implementing the Back Pay Act. The agreement contains no specific language to indicate an intention not to provide interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that interest is not applicable because the Back Pay Act at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1) provides for interest when back pay results from an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." The administrative judge further found that there was no finding that the RIF separation at issue was unjustified or unwarranted, and the settlement agreement explicitly stated that it was "the compromise of disputed claims and is not to be construed as an admission of liability or culpability by either party." We do not agree with the administrative judge's analysis. The basis for the appellant's entitlement to back pay is the settlement agreement and not the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tichenor v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 386 &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Therefore, no finding that the separation was unjustified is necessary. Our task in enforcing the agreement is to interpret the language of the document. As stated above, in similar circumstances, the Board has interpreted "back pay" in a settlement agreement to mean payment consistent with provisions of the Back Pay Act, and has included interest as a part of the statutory definition without requiring a finding that the personnel action was unwarranted or unjustified. <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 45 &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Kellihan</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In entering into the agreement, the parties were free to exclude interest and, if the agreement indicated that interest was to be excluded, then mere usage of the term "back pay" would not require payment of interest. However, this agreement neither explicitly nor implicitly excludes payment of interest. The agency argues on petition for review that the agreement should be interpreted to indicate that interest was not intended. According to the agency, such exclusion is implied because 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.806 sets forth the method for calculating interest and the agreement does not reference that regulation. We are not persuaded by the agency's argument. Nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805, which is cited in the agreement, precludes an agency from agreeing to pay interest. In fact, the regulation reads as if interest were to be expected. Paragraph (e) of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805 lists the offsets and deductions that an agency must make from the gross back-pay amount. In making those offsets and deductions, the agency is instructed that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[f]or the purpose of computing the amount of back pay under paragraph (e) of this section, interest <span class="Italic">shall</span> be included in the amount from which deductions for erroneous payments are made, as required by &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2) of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(f) (emphasis supplied). Because the agreement uses the term of art "back pay" without defining it and refers to a regulation that directs interest to be calculated before deductions and offsets are taken, we find that the agreement provides for interest on the back pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should the settlement call for a lump sum payment that is still subject to deductions and TSP contributions, the payment scheme is different than that contemplated by the Back Pay Act, and interest that could be required under that statute will not be implied as a component of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Markey v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MARKEY_GABY_NY_1221_05_0076_X_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249741.pdf">101 MSPR 456</a>, 459-60 &#x00B6; 8, 2006 MSPB 77 (2006). If a settlement calls for back pay, a lump sum refund for sick leave will not be applied, <span class="Italic">DeOcampo v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-11-0534-C-1 (NP 1/30/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the appellant reiterates his argument below that he separated from service with a sick leave balance of 77.20 hours and is entitled under the Back Pay Act to a lump-sum payment in the same manner as for annual leave. The Back Pay Act requires the payment of "pay, allowances, or differentials." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b). According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), "<span class="Italic">Pay, allowances, and differentials</span> means pay, leave, and other monetary employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation and which are payable by the employing agency to an employee during periods of Federal employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. OPM's regulations specifically exclude from back pay those payments payable upon an employee's separation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> ("[L]ump-sum payments for annual leave[ ] are not covered."). The appellant's argument is based on the premise that annual and sick leave are treated exactly the same for purposes of the Back Pay Act. Because, however, lump-sum payments for annual leave are explicitly excluded from amounts payable under the Back Pay Act pursuant to OPM's implementing regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803, and because there is nothing in the language of the Back Pay Act itself that authorizes lump-sum payments for sick leave, the appellant is not entitled under the Back Pay Act to such a payment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Independent of the Back Pay Act (which governs the appellant's entitlements under the settlement agreement), employees who separate from federal service are entitled by statute to a lump-sum payment for unused annual leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5551-5552; 5 C.F.R. part 550, subpart L. Thus, the lump-sum payment that the appellant received for his annual leave was both authorized and required by statute. There is no similar authorization for unused sick leave balances. Because there is no statutory authority for lump-sum payments for unused sick leave and federal employees are not entitled to such payments upon separation, the appellant is not entitled either under statute or the terms of the settlement agreement to a lump-sum payment for unused sick leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant cites language from 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(d) for the proposition that he is entitled to a cash payment for his unused sick leave. However, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(d) merely states that the employee can choose to use available annual or sick leave during a back pay period. It means that the appellant could have chosen to exhaust his sick leave balance instead of being placed in a regular pay status during the back pay period if he determined that to be advantageous. It does not authorize a pay-out of sick leave, or even annual leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal the result was affirmed, <span class="Italic">DeOcampo v. Dept. of Army</span>, 551 Fed. Appx. 1000, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. DeOcampo's argument about unused sick leave is likewise unavailing. Mr. DeOcampo relies on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(d), which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In computing the amount of back pay under section 5596 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart, an agency shall grant, upon request of an employee, any sick or annual leave available to the employee <span class="Italic">for a period of incapacitation if the employee can establish that the period of incapacitation was the result of illness or injury</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5. C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(d) (emphasis added). The language requiring an employee to "establish that the period of incapacitation was the result of illness or injury" clearly indicates that this provision is unrelated to the lump-sum payment of unused sick leave. Rather, as the Board stated, this provision means that "the employee can choose to use available annual or sick leave during a back pay period...instead of being placed in a regular pay status during the back pay period if he determined that to be advantageous. It does not authorize a pay-out of sick leave."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Board's reliance on the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulation is reasonable. The Back Pay Act entitles Mr. DeOcampo to "pay, allowances, or differentials." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b). The Back Pay Act's implementing regulation defines the terms "pay, allowances, and differentials," and specifically excludes monetary benefits "payable to separated or retired employees based upon a separation from service, such as retirement benefits, severance payments, and lump-sum payments for annual leave." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803.

While it does not appear from our review of PS Form 8039 that it asks for information outside the scope of the Act, PS Form 8038 does ask for information which exceeds the statutory and regulatory requirements of the Back Pay Act and thus is not consistent with the agency's responsibility under the Act....</p>

The normal meaning of initiate is to begin, not to complete."; dissent by Judge Chen: "initiation of payment must mean initiation of the transfer, not, as the majority holds, initiation of internal and preliminary steps, like, say, opening up a file, which may be necessary to eventually effectuate a transfer").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The phrase "back pay" in a settlement may include payment of a bonus. <span class="Italic">Amos v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 186, 187-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10 (1999), remanding an appeal for the AJ to determine the parties' intent, explained that the Board does not apply a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> approach to implementation of a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agreement provided in pertinent part that: (1) The appellant's demotion would be rescinded and she would be "immediately" reinstated to her supervisory position at a different duty station; (2) the agency would provide her with "back pay and benefits, pursuant to the Back Pay Act," from the effective date of her demotion until the date of her reinstatement; and (3) she would receive a "30 day No Time Off Letter (NTOL)," but suffer no loss in pay, and the letter would be removed from her personnel file within one year. The parties agreed that the Board would retain jurisdiction over the matter for purposes of enforcing the terms of the agreement, and the administrative judge (AJ) then issued an ID dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, the appellant filed a PFE stating that she had not received the back pay and benefits due her under the agreement, including her merit pay bonus and "EVA" bonus[1] for Fiscal Year 1997 which, she asserted, she would have received had she not been demoted. The agency responded that it had fully complied with the settlement agreement and provided evidence to show that the demotion had been canceled, and that the appropriate forms had been submitted to the Minneapolis Postal Data Center to correct the appellant's salary and reimburse her for the difference in pay to which she was due. The agency denied that the appellant was entitled to a merit pay bonus or an EVA bonus since neither was specifically provided for in the agreement, and indicated further that, under its terms, the appellant had received a NTOL letter, and that "other supervisors ha[d] been denied merit pay and EVA based on less discipline than [she] received." The appellant maintained that she was entitled to the bonuses, as part of her "make whole" remedy under the agreement, and that the parties had, in fact, contemplated that the bonuses would be part of her back pay. She also disputed the agency's claim regarding the effect of the NTOL letter on her right to receive the bonuses. And, to the extent there was any ambiguity about the agreement, the appellant moved for the opportunity to engage in discovery to develop a factual record and the opportunity to present live testimony at a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although not identified in the record, the term refers to a bonus under the Economic Value Added (EVA) Variable Pay Program which may be awarded each year to Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt supervisors. <span class="Italic">See generally Brown v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 80 MSPR 375, 378 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ allowed neither, and instead issued an ID in which he found that the appellant had failed to show that the agency breached the agreement. Specifically, he found, in the absence of any response by the appellant to the agency's documentation indicating that her back pay had been processed by the Data Center, that she had actually received the back pay and that, therefore, as to that matter, the agency was in compliance with the agreement. The AJ found, however, that, because the agreement did not specifically provide for the bonuses, the appellant was not entitled to them. And, the AJ found that the words "back pay and benefits" did not inherently encompass either merit pay or EVA pay. As such, he denied the appellant's PFE.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her PFR, the appellant contends that she is entitled to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief and she disputes the AJ's finding that the term "back pay and benefits" does not inherently include the bonuses. In the alternative, the appellant contends that, in this particular case, the parties intended that the bonuses be included. And, she argues that the AJ erred in imposing the burden of proof on her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not apply a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> analysis in the construction of the terms of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Kelley v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 50 MSPR 635, 642 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs,</span> 68 MSPR 314, 320-21 (1995). Instead, in construing the terms of a settlement agreement which is, after all, a contract between the parties, the Board examines the four corners of the agreement itself to determine the parties' intent<span class="Italic">. Kelley</span>, 50 MSPR at 642. Here, the parties provided that the appellant would receive "back pay and benefits, pursuant to the Back Pay Act." Back pay is a term of art, and the parties explicitly stated their intent for it to have the meaning set forth in the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. United States Postal Service,</span> MSPB Docket No. BN-0752-97-0225-X-1, slip op. at 5 (Apr. 7, 1999); <span class="Italic">Kellihan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 72 MSPR 47, 50 (1996). The Act defines back pay as all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee would normally have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amount earned by the employee through other employment during that period.[2] 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see Bradley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 110, 113 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As such, we reject the appellant's claim that the term "back pay and benefits, pursuant to the Back Pay Act" is ambiguous, and that, therefore, parole evidence may be offered to determine the intent of the parties with regard to that term. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Greco v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (if the terms of the agreement are unambiguous, the intent of the parties is determined from the words of the agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the AJ found that "the words 'back pay and benefits' do not inherently encompass either merit pay or EVA pay," he provided no support for his finding. Nor are we aware of any. On the contrary, under certain circumstances, the Board has found that employees may be entitled to back bonuses under the terms of a settlement agreement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Basbas v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 516, 519-20 (1997), the Board found that, when the agency denied the appellant a Postal Career Executive Service (PCES) merit increase, it violated a term of an agreement which provided that he would be reassigned from the position of Postmaster, EAS-20 at his current grade, pay and benefits, because the right to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration for an annual performance award was a benefit of PCES employment. And, in construing a settlement agreement term which provided that the appellant's performance rating would be changed to "a satisfactory or met expectation," the Board found that, if all employees with that performance rating or better for the relevant rating period in a group to which the appellant belonged were given a bonus, and no other circumstances disqualified him from receiving a bonus, then he might be entitled to one as a result of the change in his rating. <span class="Italic">See Vaughan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 541, 548 (1998). Thus, the appellant may, in fact, be entitled under the terms of the agreement to the bonuses she claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not err in imposing the burden of proof on the appellant in this case. As the party seeking enforcement, the ultimate burden is on the appellant to show that the agency failed to fulfill the terms of the settlement agreement. The agency must produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance with the agreement, upon the appellant's filing of a PFE. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 546.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ did not inform the appellant, prior to issuance of the CID, that she bore the burden of proving that the agency did not comply with the settlement agreement or of what she must do to meet her burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See Anthony v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice,</span> 76 MSPR 45, 51 (1997). As such, the appellant has submitted no evidence in support of her claim that a merit bonus and/or an EVA bonus was payable, and that she would have received one or both of them. Although the agency asserts that the agency's issuance to the appellant of the 30-day NTOL would have precluded her receiving either bonus, the unsworn statement of the agency representative to that effect is not evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McClain v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 76 MSPR 230, 238 (1997). We are unable to determine on this record whether the appellant is entitled to a merit bonus or an EVA bonus because of the lack of evidence to show the criteria for awarding those bonuses, and the lack of evidence as to the effect of the NTOL on any such entitlement. Therefore, this case must be remanded so that the parties can submit evidence regarding the appellant's entitlement to the bonuses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant notes that, despite her requests, the AJ did not convene a hearing or allow her to pursue discovery. In an enforcement proceeding, an employee is not entitled to either discovery or a hearing in order to establish her allegations, although the AJ may grant discovery and a hearing in his discretion, if necessary to resolve disputed facts. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Ben</span> <span class="Italic">Espinoza v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 541, 548-49 (1998) (settlement that raised performance appraisal level may have necessitated payment of bonus to appellant if all employees with a similar rating in appellant's group received a bonus).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A bonus entitlement will not be created by implication through a settlement, <span class="Italic">Galatis v.

USPS</span>, 111 MSPR 484, 2009 MSPB 104 (2009)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the settlement agreement's provision granting him back pay as an EAS-17 supervisor to March 17, 2007, makes him retroactively entitled to a pay for performance award as a supervisor, and he states that the payment of this additional pay for fiscal year 2007 ranged from 5% to 12% of base annual salary. The agency responds that the appellant was not entitled to such pay in the form of a bonus or a raise because during the back pay period he never worked as a supervisor and so did not have supervisory goals in terms of which his performance could have been rated. However, the appellant's absence from the kind of position to which he has now been restored is not necessarily dispositive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under certain circumstances, the Board has found that employees may be entitled to back bonuses under the terms of a settlement agreement. Thus in <span class="Italic">Basbas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 516, 520-21 (1997), a settlement agreement in a demotion appeal provided that the appellant would receive saved grade, pay and benefits in a reassignment that would be substituted for the demotion. Despite the appellant's absence from a managerial position during the entire period, the Board held that the appellant was entitled to a merit increase benefit that was awarded to all managers in the district. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 541, 547-48 (1998), where the appellant also settled his appeal of a demotion, he contended that a bonus was a benefit due him under the agreement because it provided that he would receive a retroactive rating of "satisfactory" and all managers in his district who received this rating or better received the bonus. The Board held that the appellant could be entitled to the bonus if his allegations were true and no other circumstance disqualified him and remanded the case for consideration of additional evidence bearing on the issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These cases are consistent with the general rule in cases where the Board has ordered back pay in a decision. The Board has held that an agency may be required to include pay for performance as part of an appellant's back pay, but only if some provision of law mandates the payment or the appellant clearly establishes that he would in fact have received such an award. <span class="Italic">Blackmer v. Department of the Navy,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 624, 631-32 (1991).<span class="Italic"></span> In <span class="Italic">Blackmer,</span> the Board found that the performance award at issue was discretionary, not mandatory, and that the appellant failed to show he would have received such an award. The Board indicated that he could have shown such entitlement by evidence that his performance before or during his reassignment to another foreman position warranted one. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 632. Here, the appellant merely asserts that, since the agreement retroactively placed him in an EAS-17 position, he is entitled to an award of pay for performance as part of his back pay. While he states that the EAS performance awards made for 2007 ranged from 5% to 12% of base annual salary, he has not asserted or provided any evidence that the awards were mandatory or that all EAS supervisors received them. We find that he has not clearly established that he would have received such an award and that therefore the agreement does not entitle him to pay for performance as a part of his back pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A general release precluded a claim that a settled appeal entitled the appellant to consequential damages, <span class="Italic">Kwartler v. VA</span>, 342 Fed. Appx. 614, 617 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Kwartler is not entitled to an award of consequential damages. Kwartler waived any claim to such an award when she signed the settlement agreement. In that agreement Kwartler "waive[d] any and all actions, claims, complaints, EEO Complaints, grievances, appeals and proceedings of whatever nature against VA, its past and present officers and employees, in their personal as well as their official capacities, including attorney fees, which are now or hereafter may be asserted by her or on her behalf on any action taken as of the date of Appellant's execution of this Agreement, with the exception of any claims that may arise by reason of breach of any term of this Settlement Agreement." None of the allegations made by Kwartler on appeal are alleged to have arisen from a breach of the agreement; Kwartler has therefore waived any such claims. Having voluntarily accepted the settlement agreement and its benefits, Kwartler cannot now bring a claim that she explicitly waived.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the court hinted at the possibility of compensation other than damages, <span class="Italic">Bernard v. USDA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-3083.Opinion.6-9-2015.1.PDF">788 F.3d 1365</a>, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject the government's argument that all Mr. Bernard seeks is $12,400 in damages, the Board cannot award damages, and therefore the Board cannot award a remedy even if he proves breach. <span class="Italic">See Lary v.

Moreover, Mr. Bernard did not limit his petition to a damages remedy. His red card has admittedly not been fully restored to its pre-2012 status, and the Board's enforcement authority is broad enough to facilitate such restoration, within the limits of the agency's valid policies, <span class="Italic">see Smith v. Dep't of Army</span>, 458 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

After litigation, no breach was found, and the agency refused to send another check to pay the lump sum. The court determined that the agency's obligations under the settlement were not negated by the enforcement litigation, that the enforcement litigation over the reissuance of the check was not unduly delayed, and that the agency was required to make good to the appellant its obligation to pay the lump sum.</p>

Among other things, the settlement agreement did not address the amount of severance pay to be repaid, including whether the appellant owed the gross or the net amount.

Because <span id="Page_5139"></span>the settlement agreement essentially substituted reinstatement pay for severance pay with the "intent...to enable Ms. McDonald to complete 25 years of service," it was foreseeable under the circumstances that a dispute regarding payments and offsets might arise.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 541, &#x00B6; 11 (2010) (no breach of settlement agreement where the settlement agreement did not contain any provision requiring the agency to perform the action at issue); <span class="Italic">Quackenbush v. Department of Justice,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 543, 544 (1990) (the Board will not resolve the parties' disagreement over the amount of tax to be withheld from a payment made under a settlement agreement). This dispute therefore belongs "in another forum." <span class="Italic">See Quackenbush</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 544.</p>
