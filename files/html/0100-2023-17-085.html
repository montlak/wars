<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-86"><span class="space">6.</span> Representative Rate</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Upon an employee's release from her competitive level, assignment rights are triggered and they may involve comparison of salary or wage rates under differing or flexible compensation schemes. The question of what constitutes a "representative rate" for purposes of compensation comparison does not often arise; most RIFs involve employees occupying well-defined wage or salary systems. <span class="Italic">Sperling v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 629, 633-35 (1998), provides guidance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The bump and retreat assignment rights set forth in Subpart G of the RIF regulations provide in pertinent part that when a group I or II employee is released from a competitive level, the agency shall offer assignment to another competing position which requires no reduction, or the least possible reduction in "representative rate," and that the released employee can displace another employee in a position that is no more than three grades, or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent, below the position from which the employee was released. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(a)-(c). The regulations further provide that the determination of equivalent grade intervals shall be based on a comparison of representative rates, and define "representative rate" as "the fourth step of the grade for a position subject to the General Schedule, the prevailing rate for a position under a wage-board or similar wage-determining procedure, and for other positions, the rate designated by the agency as representative of the position." 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.203, 351.701(e). The RIF regulations also specifically prohibit an agency from assigning an employee to a position having a higher representative rate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.704(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Dube v. Department of the Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 394 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first find no error in the agency's decision to set different representative rates for its PCES positions. The agency created its PCES system pursuant to Congressional authority, and designed it as a gradeless system, similar to the Senior Executive Service, consisting of two levels, PCES I and PCES-II. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1986). PCES-II positions include only the highest-ranking officials in the agency, while PCES-I is made up of the other levels of management. 807 F.2d at 1579-80. The positions within either PCES-I or PCES-II were designed to be gradeless in order to allow management the flexibility to best match an executive's ability or potential with the agency's staffing needs. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1580. Not all PCES positions are the same, however. Some positions have more responsibilities than others, and the agency determined representative rates of pay to reflect the established hierarchy of responsibility and reporting relationships within the PCES system. Thus, the record reflects, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found, that the agency's PCES system is, in fact, gradeless. It is also neither subject to the General Schedule nor under a wage-board or similar wage-determining procedure. We, therefore, find that the agency had authority to designate representative rates for the positions in that system under the RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.203, 351.701(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next find that the agency acted within its discretion in setting the representative rates for its different PCES positions. Section 351.203, 5 CFR, provides that the representative rate is the rate designated by the agency as representative of the position. The regulations, however, do not mandate the manner in which the agency must designate that rate. The Board has previously recognized that agencies have discretion regarding various matters incidental to its invoking and carrying out the requirements of the RIF regulations<span class="Italic">. See Cook v. Department of the Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 454, 459-60 (1997) (agency has discretion to avoid deficit situation); <span class="Italic">Gregg v. Department of the Navy</span>, 71 MSPR 127, 133-34 (1996) (agency has discretion in both setting specific cutoff date for submission of updated qualifications statements, and in evaluating qualifications while conducting a RIF); <span class="Italic">Cox v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 41 MSPR 686, 689 (1989) (agency has discretion to determine which positions to abolish or retain during a RIF). <span class="Italic">See also Hayes v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 829 F.2d 1092, 1100 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (agency has wide discretion in conducting a RIF, and absent evidence of patent unfairness or bad faith, the Board may properly defer to an agency's determination of the requirements that an individual must satisfy to qualify for a particular position). We similarly find here, that the agency's determination of the representative rates to be used in determining assignment rights under the RIF regulations for its PCES positions was within its discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency's method for setting those representative rates was not patently unfair, in bad faith, or otherwise an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Hayes</span>, 829 F.2d at 1100. The record establishes that the <span id="Page_3085"></span>agency sought OPM's advice regarding the propriety of designating different representative rates of pay for its different PCES positions, and reports that OPM assured it that this action was consistent with the RIF regulations. The appellant has not submitted any evidence controverting the agency's assertion, and we find that the agency appropriately relied upon OPM's assurances. <span class="Italic">See Manescalchi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 MSPR 479, 485-86 (1997). We also disagree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency's creation of separate representative rates of pay contravened the FPM. Moreover, to the extent that the now-defunct FPM applies to the agency's 1992-93 restructuring or the 1995 compliance RIF, it does not have regulatory authority, and thus does not require reversing the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Dube</span>, 72 MSPR at 398.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sperling</span> was modified by <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 168, 171-72 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the regulatory requirements and the evidence of record, we concluded in <span class="Italic">Sperling</span> that the PCES system is, indeed, a gradeless system, and that the agency both had the authority to designate different representative rates for the positions in it and acted within its discretion in doing so. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 75 MSPR at 634-35. We also found that the method used by the agency in setting those representative rates was not patently unfair, done in bad faith, or otherwise an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 635. Finally, we held that the agency properly compared the appellant's 1992 PCES representative rate for her former position with the 1995 representative rates of the positions as to which she claimed assignment rights, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 635-36, relying in part on 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(e)(2), under which assignment rights must be determined on the basis of pay rates in effect on the date of the issuance of specific RIF notices. Thus, we concluded, the RIF was correctly run.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon further consideration of these holdings, we continue to believe that the law supports the agency's position that the PCES system is a gradeless system; that the agency both had the authority to designate different representative rates for the positions in it and acted within its discretion in doing so; and that the method used to set those representative rates was not patently unfair, done in bad faith, or otherwise an abuse of discretion. We now overrule, however, our holding that the agency properly took individual RIF actions based on a comparison of the 1992 representative rate of each appellant's former position with the 1995 representative rate of the position(s) to which he or she seeks assignment. Instead, we rule that the agency is required to reconstruct the appellant's PCES representative rate from its 1992 level to a theoretical 1995 level so that it may be fairly compared to other PCES positions in the 1995 organization.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We need not look anew at our holding in <span class="Italic">Manescalchi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 MSPR 479 (1997), that the agency properly examined positions and made assignment determinations based on whether those positions existed and were encumbered in 1995 rather than at the time of the restructuring in 1992-1993. Our decision here does not address the agency's EAS pay levels, but is limited to the specific circumstances of the PCES system which, as explained in <span class="Italic">Sperling,</span> is significantly different from other pay method categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the attributes of the PCES system is that it provides for pay adjustments that are not granted to positions in the EAS pay levels. As a result, employees who were reassigned to other PCES positions in 1992 and 1993 have had the advantage of the subsequent adjustments that occurred in the intervening years until the 1995 RIF was run. Each such increase in pay corresponded to an increasingly higher representative rate. Because employees, such as the appellant, who were demoted to EAS jobs, were ineligible for those adjustments to the pay level of their now-abolished former positions, and because representative rates are determined on the basis of pay rates, they would automatically be disadvantaged in any comparison of the 1992 representative rate of their former PCES positions with the 1995 rates of the positions to which they seek assignment. We find that he and others in his situation should not be disadvantaged by the absence of any documented pay adjustment for their abolished jobs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The very purpose of decisions like that in <span class="Italic">Sink,</span> 65 MSPR 628, was to require the agency to restore, "on paper," to the positions they would have held had the illegal RIF not occurred, those appellants who appealed their earlier demotions, and then to place them into positions to which they were entitled under the 1995 organizational structure. To accomplish that goal fairly in the unique situation involving PCES employees, we find, in the interest of equity and justice, requires the agency to determine a constructive rate as of 1995 for the positions that were abolished in 1992 and 1993. Moreover, under the unique circumstances of this RIF, it is the method most in keeping with the requirement of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(e)(2) that assignment rights be determined on the basis of pay rates in effect on the date of the issuance of specific RIF notices, here April 18, 1995. Each appellant would then be entitled to exercise assignment rights based on this comparison and the availability of positions within the 1995 organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We noted in <span class="Italic">Sperling</span> that even if we were to have held that the proper comparison was between the 1992 rates of all of the positions, as the appellant there argued, the evidence of record showed that the result would be no different. <span class="Italic">Sperling,</span> 75 MSPR at 636.[2] We cannot make an equivalent determination here under the rule we set in this case, however, because as discussed above, the representative rate of the appellant's 1992 position has not been augmented by the pay adjustments that have been given to the positions that were created in 1992. Nor have the parties submitted evidence and argument as to the exact manner in which pay adjustments are calculated and awarded. We conclude, therefore, in the absence of a prior agency determination of the constructive 1995 rate for the appellant's former position as Director, Office of Technical Support, PCES-01, and sufficient evidence on the issue, that we cannot know the result of the application of the correct method for determining the appellant's representative rate. Accordingly, the agency must be found in noncompliance with the RIF requirements, and its demotion action cannot stand. As in <span class="Italic">Sink</span>, if the agency wishes to conduct a RIF, it is directed to do so in accordance with the method we have just outlined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;For this reason, we do not reopen the <span class="Italic">Sperling</span> decision, since no different result would obtain.</p>
