<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-83"><span class="space">3.</span> Proper Party; Intervenor</h4>
<p class="noindent">Either party to an arbitration award may file an exception to the award. 5 CFR 2425.2(a) (2022). A "party" is any labor organization or agency or activity who participated as a party in a matter involving the issuance of an arbitration award. 5 CFR 2421.11(b)(3)(ii) (2022). A party need not participate in the arbitration hearing to file exceptions to an adverse arbitration award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard and FEMTC Local 127</span>, 53 FLRA 390, 396 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the statute permits a party to the arbitration to file a grievance, the identity of the union's representative at the time exceptions are filed is not material to the union's standing to file the exceptions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l INS Council and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 69 FLRA 549, 551 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the Agency asserts that the grievant does not have standing to file the exception because the Union was replaced by a different exclusive representative. Thus, the Agency claims that the Union could not file exceptions to the award or give the grievant the authority to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree.&#x2003;The Statute provides, in pertinent part, that "[e]ither party to arbitration...may file...an exception to any arbitrator's award."[33] Further, as relevant here, the Authority's Regulations define "party" as "[a]ny labor organization...[w]ho participated as a party...[i]n a matter where the award of an arbitrator was issued."[34]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.11(b)(3)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this language to the facts of this case, there is no dispute that the Union filed the grievance pursuant to the parties' agreement and was--along with the Agency--a party to the arbitration. Therefore, under the plain language of the Statute and the Authority's Regulations, the Union is a party permitted to file exceptions to the award.[35] As such, we find that the Union, despite ceasing to be the unit's exclusive representative, is a party that may file exceptions to the award, and had the authority to designate the grievant as its representative to file exceptions on its behalf.[36]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.11(b)(3)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NFFE</span>, 56 FLRA 41 n.4. <span class="Italic">Cf. Air Force, OK City Air Logistics, Ctr., Tinker AFB, OK</span>, 49 FLRA 968, 968 (1994) (finding that a grievant who had not been a party to the arbitration, and who had not been authorized to file exceptions on behalf of a party to the arbitration, lacked standing to file exceptions.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This finding is consistent with private-sector labor-law precedent. The courts have held that decertification does not affect a union's substantive right to act on behalf of employees under the collective-bargaining agreement in existence at the time of a grievance,[37] or "deprive [a union] of its standing to pursue [a] grievance...under and according to the terms of the [a]greement."[38] National Labor Relations Board precedent also holds that a decertified union has the right and duty to represent employees in pre-decertification grievances under the parties' collective-bargaining agreement, despite being replaced by a different exclusive representative.[39]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Order to Show Cause</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel filed exceptions, and the Agency filed an opposition. Thereafter, the Authority issued an Order directing counsel to show cause why his exceptions should not be dismissed because he lacked standing to file them. The Authority stated that the record indicated that counsel filed the exceptions on his own behalf, rather than as a representative of the Union, which was a party to the arbitration. Based on this, the Authority stated that counsel did not appear to be a party to the arbitration within the meaning of the Authority's Regulations; as such, he appeared to lack standing to file exceptions.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority ordered counsel to demonstrate that the exceptions were filed on behalf of the Union.&#x2003;Counsel filed nothing in response.

<p class="noindent">There is a distinction between the union and the grievant. The union is the party for purposes of seeking review. A union that becomes the exclusive representative may file exceptions in a case arbitrated by a different union that was previously the exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE and VA Automation Ctr., Austin</span>, 57 FLRA 769, 769 n.* (2002).

Thus, we conclude that the Union's exceptions are properly before us.").</p>

A grievant is not made a party because the union states that the union has no objection to the grievant proceeding with exceptions; the record should demonstrate that the grievant participated as a party before the arbitrator or that he was authorized by the union to file exceptions. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Tooele Army Depot and IAM Lodge 2261</span>, 38 FLRA 454, 455 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 49 FLRA 968, 969 (1994) ("As the grievant was not a party to the proceeding and was not authorized by a party to file on its behalf, the grievant is without standing...to file exceptions").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">One of the individual grievants, JM, wrote a letter to the Authority claiming that the "Union failed to list [his] name in the Table of Award correctly." Letter from JM to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. Under the Authority's Regulations, only a "party" to an arbitration may file an exception. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(a) (stating that "[e]ither party to an arbitration...may file an exception to an arbitrator's award rendered pursuant to the arbitration"). A "party" to an arbitration is defined in the Authority's Regulations as "(b) Any labor organization or agency or activity...(3) Who participated as a party...(ii) In a matter where the award of an arbitrator was issued." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.11(b)(3)(ii). In this case, the parties who participated in the arbitration were the Union and the Agency. The grievant, who did not participate in the arbitration, may not file an exception. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2904</span>, 20 FLRA 3, 3-4 (1985) (finding that an individual who was not a party to the arbitration lacked standing to file an exception). Accordingly, we will not consider JM's letter.</p>

<p class="noindent">A grievant may prosecute exceptions if the union authorizes the grievant to act as its designee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1984 and DOD, DCMD Philadelphia</span>, 56 FLRA 38, 38 n.1 (2000). The designation should be made with some formality. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Military Entrance Processing Station and AFGE Local 1627</span>, 45 FLRA 976, 976-77 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 46 FLRA 101 (1992) (letter from union to grievant stating that union would not file exceptions but that grievant "may always do so on your own behalf" did not show that grievant participated in case as party or that she was authorized by union to file exceptions). But a relatively informal designation by the union to the grievant authorizes the grievant to file the exceptions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l INS Council and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 69 FLRA 549, 550-52 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the grievant lacks standing to file exceptions, because (1) the grievant provided only "an informal email from [the Union] purporting to grant her authority to file her exceptions"; and (2) the Union is no longer the exclusive representative of the grievant's bargaining unit, and thus, may not itself file exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that grievants are not parties that may file exceptions to arbitration awards.[24] A union, however, may designate a grievant as its representative for purposes of filing exceptions to an arbitration award.[25] But a union's mere acquiescence to a grievant's request to file exceptions on his or her own behalf, does not provide a grievant the necessary authority to file exceptions under the Statute.[26] Thus, where a grievant files exceptions to an award, the Authority will determine whether the record demonstrates that the grievant has been duly designated by a union as its representative for purposes of filing exceptions to the award.[27]</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1821"></span>Here, the record shows that the Union designated the grievant to file exceptions on the Union's behalf. The grievant asked for a letter from the Union giving her the authority to file exceptions and "taking [the matter] out of [the Union]'s hands." The Union advised the grievant that it "w[ould] provide a letter giving [the grievant] the power to appeal." When the grievant later followed up with the Union requesting that letter, the Union's attorney replied by email: "Betty, power granted." Thus, undisputed facts in the record clearly indicate that both the Union and the grievant understood, through their email exchanges, that the Union was designating the grievant as its representative to file exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the grievant, acting on behalf of the Union, has standing to file the exceptions.[40]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;Member Pizzella agrees that the communications of record, in this case, sufficiently demonstrate that the Union intended to, and did in fact, designate and authorize the grievant to act on its behalf in filing these exceptions. Member Pizzella is nonetheless concerned that the analysis does not adequately explain under what circumstances a purported designation would, or would not be, sufficient. In many, if not most, circumstances a curt three-word email would be insufficient to demonstrate that the Union was unmistakably authorizing someone to act on its behalf. But, under these circumstances, it does because of the preceding trail of communications. Although the Authority has not had many opportunities to weigh in on such designations, when it has done so, the Authority has applied a "sufficiency" standard--i.e. that the record sufficiently demonstrates that both parties understand that the grievant or another individual was actually and unmistakably, designated to act on behalf of the union. <span class="Italic">See DOJ BOP Guaynabo</span>, 66 FLRA 81, 85-86 (2015), <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3495</span>, 60 FLRA 509, 509 n.1 (2004); <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh I</span>, 45 FLRA 976, and <span class="Italic">DOT FAA San Diego</span>, 15 FLRA 407(1984).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The grievant filed a motion to intervene.&#x2003;Authority regulations do not provide for such intervention in arbitration cases. This is consistent with the Statute, which provides that arbitration may be invoked by the exclusive representative or the agency, but not by an employee grievant. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(ii) (employee grievant has independent right to present case in grievance process) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii) (only exclusive representative has right to invoke arbitration). Because a grievant has no statutory right to become a party in arbitration, there is no basis to become a party through intervention. However, the arguments made by the Union on the grievant's behalf have been carefully considered.</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator does not have a stake in the controversy sufficient to have his views considered by FLRA concerning exceptions filed by one or another of the parties who appeared before him; nor does the arbitrator have standing to secure reconsideration by the Authority of a decision modifying or setting aside his decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, San Juan and AFGE Local 2608</span>, 46 FLRA 1134, 1135 (1993); <span class="Italic">VAMC, St. Albans and AFGE Local 1988</span>, 38 FLRA 1447, 1448-49 (1991) (because arbitrator was not party to arbitration proceeding, FLRA would not accept or consider arbitrator's request for guidance in understanding FLRA's decision on exception to his award); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Carswell AFB and AFGE Local 1364</span>, 33 FLRA 757, 757 (1988) ("The Arbitrator has no standing to argue the merits of his award before the Authority because he did not participate as a party in this proceeding.").
