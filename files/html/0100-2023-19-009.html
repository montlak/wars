<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-10"><span class="space">b.</span> Timeliness of EEO Complaint</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The tolling of the ordinary period for appeal of a case to the Board depends on the filing of a timely formal EEO complaint. Although the Board has not said who has the final say on the timeliness of the filing of that complaint, there is no requirement that the complaint of discrimination be filed with the agency-employer within the Board's regulatory time for an appeal to meet the filing deadlines for mixed cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 477, 479 n.2 (1993) (EEO complaint need not be filed with agency within MSPB's adverse action appeal filing deadline; timeliness of EEO complaint is governed by the requirements of 29 CFR 1614.105 concerning initiation of counseling and subsequent filing of EEO complaint with agency); <span class="Italic">Garland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 44 MSPR 537, 540 (1990) (timeliness of EEO complaint governed by EEOC regulations, not by time limit applicable to initiation of ordinary Board appeal); <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 275, 276 (1989) (timeliness of Board appeal does not depend on whether EEO complaint is filed with agency within time allowed for filing Board appeal; timeliness of appeal depends on timely filing of EEO complaint under EEOC regulations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pre-complaint procedures--EEO counseling--should be followed for there to be a timely complaint supporting MSPB mixed-complaint jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Dunn v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-16-050-I-1 (NP 2/9/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant has been subjected to an action appealable to the Board and raises issues of prohibited discrimination, he may file a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency or a timely appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">Hess v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 40, &#x00B6; 11 (2016); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a). When, as in this case, an appellant elects to file a complaint of discrimination, it must comport with the regulatory requirements set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.105-1614.106. These regulations require a "pre-complaint process." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105. Part of that process requires an aggrieved person to make initial contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action. <span class="Italic">Conover v. Department of the Army</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 605, 613-14 (1998); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1). The regulations further discuss the pre-complaint steps that must be taken by the agency and the appellant, which ultimately determine the date by which a formal complaint of discrimination must be filed with the agency. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.105-1614.106.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After filing a timely formal complaint, the appellant may file an appeal with the Board within 30 days of his receipt of the agency's final decision or, if the agency failed to resolve his complaint within 120 days, any time after those 120 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b). Thus, to gain the right to appeal to the Board in a mixed case in which the appellant elected to proceed with the agency's internal EEO process, both an appellant's formal complaint of discrimination to the agency and his appeal to the Board must be timely filed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(b). The appellant bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, on the issue of timeliness. <span class="Italic">See Mauldin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 5 (2013); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) requires only that an aggrieved person "initiate contact" with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the effective date of the agency action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On review, the appellant argues that he initially contacted the EEO counselor on April 21, 2015, which would place him within the 45-day time limit mandated by the regulation. To support this argument, the appellant refers to a letter from the agency's EEO contact center. Although the letter ultimately closes the appellant's request for counseling due to his failure to provide the requested information, it reiterates the appellant's initial contact date of April 21, 2015. Thus, it appears that the appellant met the 45-day initial contact requirement set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see Lengerich v. Department of the Interior</span>, 454 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that a regulation should be interpreted by its plain language).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154, the regulation providing for Board <span id="Page_3322"></span>review in mixed-case appeals, requires the appellant to have filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency. Because the appellant did not continue with the pre-complaint process outlined in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105, there was no timely complaint filed, or any formal complaint at all, as a result of the April 21, 2015 contact. Therefore, we find that, due to the appellant's own inaction, he failed to file a timely formal complaint of discrimination and that, although the administrative judge relied on the August 25, 2015 date as the date of initial contact, the ultimate dismissal for untimeliness was proper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initial contact made on August 25, 2015, would exceed the 45-day limit imposed by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(1) by several months; however, the regulation provides four permissible reasons for extending the 45-day deadline. ID at 3-7 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2)). One of those reasons is that, despite due diligence, the appellant was prevented from making counselor contact. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2). The appellant has argued that after his removal an EEO counselor informed him that it would be more prudent to proceed with a grievance before filing a formal complaint of discrimination with the agency. Regardless of the veracity of this assertion, the record is clear that in April 2015, the agency sent the appellant information to be completed and returned in order to proceed with the pre-complaint process, and the appellant did neither. Ultimately, it was his own inactions that halted the first contact with an EEO counselor, not the agency's alleged prevention. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant failed to engage in basic due diligence as required by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2) to receive a waiver of the 45-day period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the Board is required to defer to the agency's determination on the timeliness of a formal complaint of discrimination. He references a nonprecedential order issued by the Board that remanded an appeal in which the initial decision rejected an agency's determination that the appellant's EEO complaint was timely filed, finding instead that the EEO complaint was untimely because the appellant did not contact the agency's EEO counselor within 45 days of the discriminatory act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

We find the appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Portal</span> to be misplaced. In that case, the agency had made an explicit determination on the question of timeliness, <span class="Italic">Portal</span> RO, &#x00B6; 5, and it is well settled that the Board must defer to the employing agency's determinations regarding the timeliness of discrimination complaints, <span class="Italic">Cloutier v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, there was no explicit determination on the question of timeliness. The appellant provided inaccurate information to the EEO counselor by claiming that the date of the discriminatory action was August 20, 2015, the date of the arbitrator's grievance decision, rather than March 13, 2015, the effective date of his removal. Given that the initial contact date recorded on the relevant form was August 25, 2015--five days after the arbitrator's decision--the EEO counselor would have had no reason to question the timeliness of the contact. Further, both the Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have indicated that an agency's acceptance and investigation of a complaint with no finding on the issue of timeliness is not a waiver of the time limit for initiating contact with an EEO counselor. <span class="Italic">Landingham</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 77, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Ziman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01842595, 1986 WL 635226 at 8 (July 23, 1986). Because we have no timeliness determination to which to defer, and in the absence of such a determination, the 45-day time limit is not considered to be waived, we find the appellant's argument to be meritless.</p>

The report indicates that the counselor was informed of the appellant's allegation that her January 31, 1995 resignation was involuntary, but does not indicate when the appellant brought this allegation to the EEO counselor. We are unable to determine whether this allegation was timely brought to the EEO counselor or whether the agency waived the time limit for bringing an allegation to the counselor. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.105(a)(2). The agency accepted the appellant's August 17, 1995 complaint for investigation and did not dismiss it as untimely. The agency did not issue a final decision, however, before the appellant filed this appeal with the Board after receiving the agency's September 13, 1996 Report of Investigation.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency stated that the appellant filed a formal EEO complaint. The agency provided a copy of the complaint, showing that the appellant filed it on August 2, 2000. The agency, however, indicated that no final agency decision had been issued on the complaint. The agency, nonetheless, asserted before the administrative judge that the appellant's EEO complaint was untimely filed. Based on this record, the administrative judge found that the appellant's formal EEO complaint was untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this determination in the initial decision did not accord proper deference to the regulations governing the EEO complaint process. Deference to those regulations dictates that an administrative judge may not dismiss an appeal as untimely filed under section 1201.154 based on the untimeliness of the appellant's formal EEO complaint absent evidence of either a final agency decision dismissing the EEO complaint as untimely that was not appealed to the EEOC, or a decision by the EEOC dismissing the complaint as untimely. <span class="Italic">See Cloutier</span>, 89 M.S.P.R., 411, &#x00B6; 6. Here, the record contains no evidence to show that either the employing agency or the EEOC has decided the timeliness of the appellant's formal EEO complaint.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, there are legitimate questions concerning the timeliness of a formal EEO complaint filed with the employing agency.

Under these circumstances, the administrative judge might well have dismissed the appeal without prejudice pending resolution of the timeliness of the complaint pursuant to the EEO regulations. At this time, however, dismissing without prejudice may not be appropriate because the status of the appellant's EEO complaint may have changed.

In fact, the agency's letter informed the appellant that he had no right of review or appeal of the matter. Thus, we find that the appellant did not make a valid election to pursue his indefinite suspension by filing an EEO complaint with the agency, and that his appeal and discrimination claim may therefore be raised before the Board.

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency issued a final agency decision, the appeal must be filed within 30 days; the appellant may not calculate the appeal time as being at any time after 120 days when a FAD was not issued prior to 120 days from the filing of the EEO complaint, <span class="Italic">White v. MSPB</span>, 230 Fed. Appx. 976, 979-80 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirements for filing a timely appeal to the Board in a mixed case are specified by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b), which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An appeal must be filed within 30 days after the [employee] receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the agency has not resolved the matter or issued a final decision on the formal complaint within 120 days, the [employee] may appeal the matter directly to the Board at any time after the expiration of 120 calendar days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b). This requirement may only be excused if "a good reason for the delay is shown." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. White argues that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(2), because the agency issued its final decision 543 days after his complaint was submitted as a mixed case, the thirty day time limit of &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1) did not apply and he could therefore file his appeal at any time. The government disagrees with Mr. White's interpretation, arguing that &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(2) "does not create an open-ended right to appeal, but rather ensures the complainant the right to come to the [Board] should his or her employing agency not promptly process a discrimination complaint." According to the government, in all cases in which the agency has issued a final decision the employee must file his appeal within thirty days of receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When construing a regulation, we look first to the underlying statute to determine whether or not the regulation is in compliance with the statute. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). We then examine the language of the regulation to determine its plain meaning. <span class="Italic">Roberto v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 440 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In doing so, we examine the entire regulation in question rather than just the sentences at issue in isolation. <span class="Italic">Reflectone, Inc. v. Dalton</span>, 60 F.3d 1572, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Moreover, we give broad deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulation, "even when that interpretation is offered in the very litigation in which the argument in favor of deference is made." <span class="Italic">Cathedral Candle Co. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 400 F.3d 1352, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The agency's construction of its own regulation[&#8197;] is 'of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co.</span>, 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's construction is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation as a whole. Congress has granted the Board "the authority to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h). Acting under this authority, the Board issued 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154, which prescribes the time for the filing of appeals. The language of &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1) imposes an absolute requirement that appeals be filed within thirty days of the employee's receipt of the agency's decision. Section 1201.154(b)(2) only applies in the alternate circumstance in which no final decision has been issued. This understanding of &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) is further supported by the purpose of the regulation. By preventing an agency from avoiding an appeal by simply never issuing a final decision, &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(2) ensures that employees have a right to appeal in all cases. Where that final decision has been issued, even after a delay of more than 120 days, it is not inconsistent with the regulation to require that the employee file his appeal within thirty days. If the thirty day time limit were not to apply, an employee could potentially file an appeal months, years, or even decades after a final decision had been issued. This would be inconsistent with the purpose of a regulation that acts to bring cases to a timely close. We therefore find that the Board did not abuse its discretion by finding that Mr. White was required by &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) to file his appeal within thirty days of receiving the final decision from the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board exercises some review authority over agency EEO procedures. Under <span class="Italic">Tate v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 653, 655 (1987), if the issue is whether an appellant actually filed a discrimination complaint, an event of significance as to the timeliness of his appeal, an agency's protestations that the complaint was not received may be discounted if the appellant provides certified mail receipts showing that he mailed materials to the agency, along with a copy of the complaint that he filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should an employee refer a mixed case to an EEOC judge prior to the issuance of a final agency decision, and if EEOC mistakenly assumes jurisdiction over the case and issues a decision, the appellant will still have an appeal to the Board. The mixed case is within the Board's jurisdiction and, lacking a final agency decision, the appellant may file with the Board at any time once 120 days elapse from the filing of the EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lang v. MSPB</span>, 219 F.3d 1345, 1347-48 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee files an appeal with the Board that is premature because either the agency has not issued a final decision or 120 days have not elapsed, the AJ should dismiss the appeal without prejudice or hold the petition for a short time to allow it to become timely. <span class="Italic">Morton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 416, 418 (1990). The appellant must wait the earlier of either 120 days from the date of the filing of the EEO complaint or the date the agency issues a decision on the complaint before appealing to the Board. Once the agency decides the case, the appellant has 30 days (20 days for complaints filed before 1994) from the receipt of an agency decision on the complaint to file with the Board. 5 CFR 1201.154(b) (2022); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 474, 476-77 (1996); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hobson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 558, 559, 3 MSPB 79 (1980) (stating filing rule and dismissing PFR because the appeal was refilled with the field office after the EEO complaint processed to the point it could be filed during the pendency of the PFR). The Board will not force an agency to issue a final agency decision on an EEO complaint. The regulations permit the appellant to appeal a mixed case directly to the Board if, given no final decision, 120 days expire from the filing of the EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Farmer v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 205, 211 &#x00B6; 14 (1998). The appellant who has not waited 120 days after filing a complaint has no right to file a premature appeal and pursue discovery; the AJ properly dismisses the complaint with leave to refile following completion of the appropriate waiting period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lozada v. EEOC</span>, 56 MSPR 62, 64 (1992) (remanding because during the pendency of a PFR, the 120-day period lapsed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Moore v. DOJ</span>, 112 MSPR 382, 2009 MSPB 190 (2009), the appellant amended an existing EEO complaint to include a termination that she also appealed to the Board after having amended the complaint but before waiting out the 120 days (or receipt of a FAD). In the initial Board case, no one advised the AJ of the EEO complaint amendment. The initial appeal was dismissed as untimely filed, and that result was affirmed on PFR and judicial review. Meanwhile, the agency issued a FAD and advised the appellant of her right to file a Board appeal on the termination, and she did so within 30 days from the issuance of the FAD. The Board, on PFR, decided the second appeal was timely, remanded the case for a merits adjudication, and rejected the agency's arguments that the first decision was either <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or operated to collaterally estop the second appeal, since the question of the effect of the amendment of the EEO complaint was not before the Board in the first appeal (collateral estoppel), and the merits of the decision were not adjudicated the first time around (<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>). Essentially, the first appeal was premature, and it was immaterial that it was untimely filed. The second appeal was timely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Key v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 12 MSPR 73, 74-75 (1982), if during the 120-day waiting period the AJ accepts jurisdiction of the case and issues a decision, the decision is of no effect and will be vacated. Under <span class="Italic">Key</span>, it is immaterial that 120 days have passed by the time the initial decision is issued; the appellant will be given leave to refile the appeal and obtain a decision within the Board's jurisdiction to issue. If an appellant files an EEO complaint to contest an adverse action, and then a Board appeal is filed after the agency dismisses or rejects the EEO complaint, the Board accepts jurisdiction of the otherwise timely adverse action appeal prior to the running of 120 days; a complaint is no longer pending with the agency. <span class="Italic">Romane v. DOD</span>, 27 MSPR 423, 425 (1985) (agency apparently dismissed EEO complaint after Board appeal was filed; the complaint was dismissed because appellant failed to respond to inquiries from agency concerning the scope of complaint and her intention to prosecute it); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 21 MSPR 352, 354 (1984) (without commenting on the effect of withdrawal of an EEO complaint, the Board implied that the region should have processed rather than dismissed an appeal as premature, when the appellant withdrew an EEO complaint during the pendency of an appeal). If the Board determines, after it receives corrected information from a party, that it erred concerning the sequencing of an EEO complaint and an appeal, the Board issues a decision, if necessary by vacating an initial decision, to reinstate an appeal that had earlier been dismissed as premature. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Duffy v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 405, 408-09 &#x00B6; 8 (2003). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-19-011.html#sec12-12">EEO Complaint Withdrawn</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the region properly dismisses an appeal as premature because 120 days have not elapsed from the filing of the complaint, the Board may, on PFR, remand the appeal for processing by the region if the 120 days have run during the pendency of the PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 477, 480 (1993); <span class="Italic">Kulling v. FAA</span>, 14 MSPR 504, 505 (1983) (appeal became timely while after the PFR was filed); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">French v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 171, 173-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (1998) (dispute over when an EEO complaint was filed in an appeal that was <span id="Page_3325"></span>dismissed as premature; the case was remanded to sort out the filing date and to determine the propriety of sanctions if the appellant misled the Board concerning the filing date); <span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 8, 11 n.1 (1997) (possible prematurity of an appeal was immaterial on a PFR because the 120-day waiting period passed prior to the adjudication of the PFR). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Santiago v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 419, 421 (1987) (Board did not remand a case when the PFR that objected to dismissal of the mixed case appeal as premature was itself untimely; the decision left unclear whether there was any other impediment to the appellant's reinitiation of his Board appeal). Should it become clear on PFR that the appellant did not file a formal EEO complaint, even though he said on his appeal form that he did, the case will be returned to the regional office (if it was earlier rejected as premature by the regional office) for adjudication. <span class="Italic">Moody v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 151, 153 &#x00B6; 4 (2002). [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-044.html#sec2-43">Premature Appeals</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-09-046.html#sec2-45">Premature Appeal that Ripens Into Appealable Action During Regional Adjudication or During PFR</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Current regulations do not establish any particular deadline for filing an appeal as long as the underlying EEO complaint is still pending with the agency. The Board abandoned the one-year filing rule in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ</span>, 30 MSPR 141, 142 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 5 USC 7702 sets no time limit for the filing of an appeal to the Board after a complaint has been filed with the agency, the Board has provided that if the agency fails to issue a timely decision, "the appellant shall nonetheless file an appeal to the Board within a year after the filing of the formal complaint with the agency." 5 CFR 1201.154(a)(2). This regulation was intended to serve the purposes of administrative efficiency and fairness by imposing a time limit for the filing of a Board appeal which both gave the agency a full opportunity to decide the complaint and assured the employee that his case would be heard by the Board before so much time had elapsed that relevant evidence would no longer be available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board still believes that these purposes are proper. However, in the absence of a specific statutory basis for imposing a one year time limit and because enforcement of section 1201.154(a)(2) may lead to dismissal of otherwise meritorious claims, the Board has determined that it will not enforce that time limit absent specific statutory authorization.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier regulations the Board appeal had to be filed not later than one year from the filing of the EEO complaint once 120 days passed without an agency final decision on the EEO case, i.e., there existed a filing window of 120 to 365 days from the date the complaint was filed. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. IRS</span>, 2 MSPR 8, 9, 2 MSPB 181 (1980). As a result, the law was that if the appellant with a mixed case delayed filing a Board appeal for more than a year after the filing of the EEO complaint, the Board would determine whether the untimely filing was excused under standards identified in its <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> decision [discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-054.html#sec2-53">Waiver of Time Limit for Appeal; <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span></a>"].<span class="Italic">Herrera v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 429, 431 (1986) (agency failed, following an EEOC remand, to notify the appellant of the right to Board appeal; the Board abandoned the one-year rule: "However, in the absence of a specific statutory basis for imposing a one year time limit and because enforcement of section 1201.154(a)(2) may lead to the dismissal of otherwise meritorious claims, the Board had determined that it will not enforce that time limit absent specific statutory authorization."); <span class="Italic">McKeithan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 515, 517 (1984) (applying the one-year rule but excusing the delayed appeal). If the late filing was due to an improper notice of appeal rights in the dismissal by the AJ of an earlier, premature appeal, the lateness was excused. <span class="Italic">McKeithan</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Boyovich v. USDA</span>, 38 MSPR 22, 24-25 (1988) (appellant was not time barred from reinstituting a mixed case RIF appeal; the AJ should have dismissed the premature appeal for a lack of jurisdiction, and the appellant could have then attempted to timely file the appeal from the date of the RIF action, rather than dismissing the appeal subject to refiling 60 days after the issuance of a final agency EEO decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If discrimination is to be raised with the Board, it is best to raise and litigate the issue at the onset of the appeal, if possible, and to avoid the later complexities of mixed case jurisdictional analysis. In <span class="Italic">Spears v. MSPB</span>, 766 F.2d 520 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> <span class="Italic">Spears v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 535 (1982), the luckless employee was discharged and appealed to the Board without raising discrimination as an issue. She lost her case. During the pendency of the Board appeal, the employee amended an earlier EEO complaint filed with her employer to add to a claim concerning denial of a reassignment, a second claim that the removal was in reprisal for filing the earlier EEO complaint. The agency investigated the complaint and, after the Board case had been decided, issued an adverse decision informing the appellant that she had the right to appeal to the Board her EEO case charging reprisal. She did, and the Board dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, since it did not "have jurisdiction to decide discrimination issues which are not raised in the course of a proceeding before it." 21 MSPR at 537. The court ruled that although the regulation then at issue, 29 CFR 1613.404, appeared to authorize the second appeal to the Board, the second case was barred by <span class="Italic">res</span> <span class="Italic">judicata</span>: having previously appealed her removal to the Board on nondiscrimination grounds and lost, the employee could not subsequently challenge her termination with the Board on the basis of discrimination (reprisal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although 5 USC 7702(e)(2) permits an employee who has filed a complaint with the agency under 5 USC 7702(a)(2) and who has not received a judicially reviewable action after 120 days to appeal to the MSPB, the statute does not provide for MSPB review after the agency reaches a final decision if the employee earlier appealed the action to MSPB. The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">Compton v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 21 MSPR 533, 534 (1984). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bartlett v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 317, 318-19 (1984) (Board lacks jurisdiction over a second appeal of a removal that it already decided when the appellant did not raise the EEO allegation before the Board but pursued the EEO claim through the EEO process, resulting in notice to the appellant to file a mixed case with the Board); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Njaka v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 264, 267-68 &#x00B6; 11 (2000) (untimely PFR from a mixed case initial decision was not excused because the appellant also pursued another EEO complaint through agency processes). One Board decision, it seems, is all that one gets on a particular appealable action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered the implications of an EEO complaint filed with the respondent after the Board appeal is filed, <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 485, 489-90 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In some cases, this circumstance could cause the agency to be unwilling to review the merits of an appellant's complaint. When an agency is willing to review the merits of the complaint, however--as it was in this case--the fact that the appellant filed his appeal before he filed his formal complaint should not preclude Board review of appealable matters that are the subject of the complaint.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We do not rule out the possibility that, under some circumstances, an appellant who withdraws his appeal in order to pursue a complaint within his agency might be precluded from obtaining a later review of the merits of his refiled appeal. This result might be appropriate, for example, if the administrative judge has taken substantial steps toward the adjudication of the appeal. In this case, however, there is no indication that the administrative judge, before dismissing the appeal, had taken any steps other than that of obtaining the agency file.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The transfer of a case from the EEO complaint systems to the Board through an appeal assumes that the Board would have jurisdiction over the case if it had been originally raised with the Board. Jurisdiction by the Board is lacking over a five-day suspension challenged through an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 39 MSPR 217, 225 (1988).
