<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-8"><span class="space">a.</span> Exemptions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Part of the efficiency of the service calculus for furloughs is the cause or necessity for the furlough. If an operating instruction of the agency exempts defined groups of employees from furloughs, before a furlough can be sustained the Board must resolve a claim that the operating instruction should have precluded the furlough, the situation addressed and requiring a remand in <span class="Italic">Dye v. Dept. of Army</span>, 121 MSPR 142, 146-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, 2014 MSPB 36 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(5) and 7513(a), an agency may furlough an employee for 30 days or less "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." An agency meets its burden of proving that a furlough promotes the efficiency of the service by showing, in general, that the furlough was a reasonable management solution to the financial restrictions placed on it and that the agency applied its determination as to which employees to furlough in a fair and even manner. <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). Before the Board reaches the issue of whether an action promotes the efficiency of the service, however, an agency must first establish that there is "cause" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 25 (2010). If the agency fails to allege or prove "cause" for the action, the Board's inquiry stops there. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Cause" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) generally connotes some specific act or omission on the part of the employee that warrants disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. Nevertheless, furloughs are unique among adverse actions because by definition they are taken for nondisciplinary reasons and are generally used to address work or funding shortages or other matters that are not personal to the affected employee. <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8. Thus, we find that the concept of "cause" in the context of a furlough appeal encompasses, for purposes of this appeal, whether the appellant met the criteria established by the agency for being subject to, and not excepted from, the furlough. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 224, 225 (1984) (addressing whether the agency established that the appellant did not meet a stated furlough exemption for employees who did not cause an expenditure of salary and expenses funds).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We have held in the context of a reduction in force that an agency has broad management discretion to take action to avoid a budget deficit. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 566, 570 (1994). The same is true in the context of a furlough. The majority of the Board held that it will not scrutinize an agency's decision to determine whether the agency has structured a furlough in a manner that second-guesses the agency's assessment of its mission requirements and priorities. <span class="Italic">Department of Labor v. Avery</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 150, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). <span class="Italic">But see</span> Vice Chairman Wagner's dissent in <span class="Italic">Avery</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 150. However, once an agency has exercised its management discretion in formulating the manner in which it will institute a furlough, the agency must treat similar employees similarly, and must justify any deviations with legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant does not contest on review the validity of the furlough in general. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 224 (the validity of the furlough, in general, was not at issue). Rather, he contends that he should not have been subjected to the furlough because he met the criteria for an exception. The record is unclear, however, as to whether the agency correctly determined that the appellant was not excepted from the furlough. Therefore, it is unclear whether the agency demonstrated "cause" for its furlough action against the appellant.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In an adverse action furlough, as in a RIF and in a directed reassignment, the Board's general review is to assure that such actions are used for legitimate reasons; therefore, the Board's focus is on the legitimacy of the reasons for the furlough, RIF, or reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Shenwick</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 294, 298 (1980) (finding directed reassignments to be analogous to RIFs, which are equally susceptible to misuse to effect any employee's separation, and noting that agencies must prove that the RIF regulations were properly invoked due to appropriate management considerations). In determining the legitimacy of the reasons for a decision not to furlough certain employees when the agency asserts that it was precluded from doing so by law, rule, or regulation, the Board need not determine, after the fact, whether a decision not to furlough certain employees was actually permissible under applicable law, rule, and regulation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 406-07 (the Board's review of a directed reassignment centers on the legitimacy of the reasons for the reassignment, not on whether the action was reversed on technical, procedural, or other grounds), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Garrison v. Department of Justice</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 154, 162 (an agency manager is not required, in making a decision affecting the employment of one of his employees, to consider facts as he believes that an adjudicator might after the fact imagine them to be; rather, an agency manager is entitled to rely on his professional experience to consider facts as he reasonably believes them to be at the time he makes his decision), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 72 F.3d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Rather, in deciding whether the agency's decision was based on legitimate management reasons or, conversely, based on reasons "personal" to an employee or a group of employees, the question is whether the agency reasonably and genuinely believed that it was precluded from furloughing that group of employees. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Cross v. Department of Transportation</span>, 127 F.3d 1443, 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the appellants asserted that the RIF could not have been conducted for a proper purpose because the legislation abolishing the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) had not yet been enacted at the time the RIFs were initiated, and so there could not have been a lack of funding at the agency until the appropriations bill "sunsetting" the ICC had passed. The court rejected that argument, holding that "[W]here agency officials reasonably and genuinely believe that the agency's abolition is inevitable and its funding is to be terminated, initiation of a RIF is proper." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1447. The court noted that conducting a RIF because of an anticipated shortage of funds does not require that the shortage exist at the time of the RIF and that agency officials who are aware of imminent legislation progressing through Congress need not wait until the legislation is enacted before taking appropriate action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court held that a significant delay by agency officials could have risked leaving insufficient time to accomplish an orderly sunset of the agency and an orderly transfer of those functions being preserved and that initiating an agency-wide RIF before enactment of the actual legislation was prudent given the short time frame within which the agency had to deal with the problem. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court held that whether the agency officials honestly and reasonably anticipated a budgetary shortfall is a question of fact that depends, in part, on whether the legitimate management reason proffered by the agency officials was credible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1447-48.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we find that the issue in this case is whether the agency officials who made the decision not to furlough the "safe haven" employees reasonably and genuinely believed that they were precluded from doing so by law, rule, or regulation. The appellants may attempt to cast doubt on the existence of a reasonable and genuine belief, and thus a legitimate management reason, in this regard. <span class="Italic">See Richard v. Department of Defense</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 146, 159 (1995), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Buckler v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 476, 496-97 (1997). Nevertheless, as set forth above, in order to prove that the furloughs in this case met the statutory efficiency of the service standard, the burden is on the agency to prove by preponderant evidence that the relevant agency officials reasonably and genuinely believed that they were precluded from furloughing the "safe haven" employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lopez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 121 MSPR 647, 653 &#x00B6; 11, 2014 MSPB 78 (2014), considered application of a DOD instruction exempting from furloughs civilians necessary to protect life and property:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the DoD furlough exceptions to the plan to furlough civilian employees for a maximum of 88 hours provided that, "[i]n order to avoid harm to mission, those employees necessary to protect safety of life and property are excepted to the extent necessary to protect life and property." CAF, Tab 4 (United States Department of the Navy Administrative Record, FY 2013 Furlough Appeals), Part 1 at 108 (emphasis added). We find that this provided an exception from the furlough for those employees who occupied positions that were generally necessary to protect life and property only "to the extent" that it was necessary for such employees to protect life and property. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 106 (May 14, 2013 memorandum from the Secretary of Defense indicating that "[W]e will except civilians...necessary to protect life and property (but only to the extent needed to provide that protection)"). It did not necessarily create a blanket exception for all employees occupying such positions regardless of whether their exception was necessary to protect life and property. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 109; <span class="Italic">Dye v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 142, &#x00B6; 7 (2014) (describing a categorical exemption from the furlough for "[a]ny" DoD employees who were not paid directly by accounts included in the DoD-Military budget, without qualifying language such as "to the extent necessary"). In other words, the exception quoted above, when read as a whole, appears to contemplate the possibility that employees occupying positions that are generally necessary to protect life and property could be excepted for only a portion of a planned furlough, i.e., to the extent necessary, or that some employees occupying positions that are generally necessary to protect life and property could be excepted while others would not be excepted. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jonson v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 12 (2014) (under a fundamental rule of statutory construction, the Board must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute so as to avoid rendering superfluous any of its language). Thus, to the extent that the appellant is asserting that the agency excepted all USROs from the furlough regardless of whether such employees were all necessary to protect life and property, we disagree. The record supports the administrative judge's finding that the relevant exception applied only "to the extent necessary" to protect life and property.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boulden v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-13-3521-I-1 (NP 2/6/2015) ("We find no basis to conclude that the agency was required to disprove the appellant's alleged, presumptive entitlement to an exemption from the furlough under the agency's furlough process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weathers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 6 (2014) (finding that, when imposing a furlough action, the agency is required to treat similar employees similarly and to justify deviations with legitimate management reasons). Instead, we find ample support in the record that the agency fairly and evenly implemented its furlough action, it had legitimate management reasons for its actions, and there is no evidence in the record that the agency treated similar employees differently. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Tinker AFSC/DP</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 14.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the furlough instructions from a higher organization allow for exceptions, the exceptions are exercised through discretion that the Board will not likely set aside, <span class="Italic">Ronso v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 122 MSPR 391, 394-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2015 MSPB 32 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's burden to show "cause" for a furlough encompasses whether the appellant met the criteria established by the agency for being subject to, and not excepted from, the furlough.[2] <span class="Italic">Dye,</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 142, &#x00B6; 9. The Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum establishing a number of exceptions to the decision to furlough employees. Among them was an exception for "those employees necessary to protect safety of life and property...to the extent necessary to protect life and property...includ[ing] selected medical personnel." The memorandum elaborated that "exceptions for the medical category are approved with the understanding [that] these exceptions preserve the minimum level of personnel needed to maintain quality of care in 24/7 emergency rooms and other critical care areas such as behavioral health." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The administrative judge framed the issue of whether the appellant fell within an exception to the furlough as an issue of "efficiency of the service." However, this issue is more appropriately addressed as one of cause. To the extent that the administrative judge incorrectly characterized this discussion, we modify the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official for the appellant's furlough limited her use of this exception to medical staff providing emergency and in-patient services. She did not use the exception for personnel that serviced out-patient clinics, such as the appellant. On review, the appellant asserts that the deciding official interpreted the exception too narrowly by not including out-patient services. He argues that his position at an out-patient clinic is critical to the well-being of patients. According to the appellant, he is the only civilian in his department, so his furlough resulted in his unqualified subordinates managing the substance abuse treatment program on the days he was furloughed. He also argues that he was deemed essential or exempt during the later government shutdown, so he should have been excepted from the furloughs resulting from sequestration for the same reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we appreciate the appellant's concern for the well-being of patients, we find no error in the administrative judge's determination that the agency proved cause, despite declining to apply the furlough exception for select medical personnel to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See also Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings where the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions). Because the exception included the phrase "to the extent necessary," it <span id="Page_3009"></span>did not create a blanket exception. <span class="Italic">See also Lopez,</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 11. Instead, the exception contemplated that management would exercise discretion, as it did here, in determining which employees were needed to preserve minimal care.</p>
