<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-103"><span class="space">b.</span> Retirement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Norton v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/NORTON_JAMES_M_PH_0752_08_0442_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_438896.pdf">112 MSPR 248</a>, 250-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-11, 2009 MSPB 176 (2009), the appellant received a discharge notice, then retired and appealed. The appellant prevailed in the appeal, the agency filed a petition for review of the initial decision, but the agency failed to provide interim relief after it was ordered by the AJ. On appellant's motion to dismiss the PFR, the Board did just that, concluding that nothing blocked interim relief for an individual who, facing discharge, entered into retirement to secure immediate income:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal of the agency's removal action. After conducting a hearing, the administrative judge reversed the action, finding that the agency had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the charges against the appellant, and ordered the agency to provide the appellant with interim relief under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A), if a petition for review was filed. The agency filed a timely petition for review of the initial decision. In his response in opposition to the agency's petition for review, the appellant, in part, moved to dismiss the petition on the basis that the agency has failed to comply with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's regulation, an agency's petition for review "must be accompanied by a certification that the agency has complied with the interim relief order, either by providing the required interim relief or by satisfying the requirements of 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(1). The agency's failure to provide the required certification of compliance with an interim relief order "may result in the dismissal of the agency's petition or cross petition for review." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4). The agency's certification must show, at a minimum, that it has appointed the appellant to a position carrying the proper title, grade, and rate of pay, and that the appointment was effective as of the date of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Moore v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 80, 83 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the certification is missing in an agency's petition for review, the Clerk of the Board generally will issue an order directing the agency to file evidence and argument showing why the petition should not be dismissed for failure to comply with the interim relief order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(2). However, the Board does not need to issue a show cause order in this case because the agency's petition clearly shows that it is on notice of the deficiency in the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Justice,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 494, 497 (1995), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 167 (1999). Indeed, in lieu of the required certification, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in ordering interim relief because the appellant is receiving a retirement annuity and, therefore, is not suffering any undue hardship by waiting for the final order of the Board. Although the agency does not explicitly acknowledge that it has not restored the appellant to his former position, or provided other appropriate relief under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2), the appellant's response confirms that the agency has not taken any action to comply with the administrative judge's interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency requests that the Board review the initial decision despite the violation of the interim relief order. [<span class="Italic">S]ee Guillebeau v. Department of the Navy,</span> 362 F.3d 1329, 1332-33 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (when an agency fails to comply with an interim relief order, dismissal of a petition for review by the Board is discretionary, not mandatory). In making this argument, the agency cites to four decisions in which the Board has found that the interim relief ordered was inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See Sink v. Department of Energy,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 153 (2008) (interim relief was inappropriate in an involuntary retirement appeal where the employee's position had been abolished in a valid agency reorganization and the employee declined a directed geographic reassignment to another position); <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Department of Justice,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 375 (2007) (interim relief was inappropriate in a whistleblower appeal of a denial of promotion where the appellant subsequently resigned from the agency and transferred to another agency); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Justice,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 92 (Board found that interim relief is generally inappropriate in a restoration appeal where the appellant is receiving Office of Workers' Compensation Benefits because doing so could result in the agency's payment of monies in contravention of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8116(a)), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 43 F.3d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Siu v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 394 (1993) (Board found that ordering interim relief may be applicable to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) retirement appeals, but administrative judges should exercise caution in granting interim relief in such appeals because doing so may result in OPM's payment of monies in contravention of its statutory authority).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that the purpose of the statutory interim relief provision is not to make the appellant whole at the interim relief stage of the proceedings. <span class="Italic">Ginocchi v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 62, 71 n.6 (1992); <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> H.R. Rep. No. 100-274, at 28-29 (1987) (back pay not to be paid before Board's decision is final). Rather, the intent of interim relief is to protect the appellant from hardship during the pendency of his appeal if he prevails in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Herrin v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 15 (2004); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 340, 350 (1993). More generally, interim relief is to benefit both the agency and the appellant by limiting the waste of human and financial resources during the petition for review process. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 100-274, at 29; <span class="Italic">Herrin,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Ginocchi,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. at 69-70. When a removal action is reversed, it is a fundamental element of interim relief that the appellant be reinstated with pay effective as of the date of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Herrin,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Navy,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 7 (2000). Further, an administrative judge's exercise of her discretion to order interim relief is subject to challenge on petition for review as an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Armstrong,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency has not shown that the administrative judge abused her discretion in ordering the appellant's reinstatement with pay in the interim relief order. In interpreting our statutory obligation to provide interim relief, the Board has found it inappropriate in two general <span id="Page_1695"></span>circumstances. The first circumstance occurs where interim relief is clearly impractical or is outside the scope of the Board's authority to provide the relief ordered. For example, in an appeal of a suspension without pay, the Board has found that interim relief normally should not be provided if the suspension had concluded and the appellant had been returned to paid duty status at the time that the initial decision was issued. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of the Navy,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 174, 177 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sink,</span> which is the primary case relied upon by the agency, we found the interim relief order was erroneous under the particular circumstances of that appeal because the appellant's position had been abolished in a legitimate reorganization, the appellant had refused to accept a geographic reassignment to an appropriate position, and the appellant had retired based upon agency-provided misinformation while on administrative leave awaiting the agency's removal decision on his refusal to accept the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Sink,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 153, &#x00B6; 17. In that case, we were concerned that the scope of interim relief should have taken into account the appellant's refusal to accept a directed reassignment, and that restoration to duty placed the appellant in a better position than a return to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-22. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Armstrong,</span> as a practical matter, the agency could not comply with the interim relief order to promote the appellant because he was no longer an employee of the agency, having resigned after filing his appeal. <span class="Italic">Armstrong,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 13. In the instant case, the agency has failed to show that there are any practical impediments that would prevent it from restoring the appellant to his former position or that his restoration to his former position would have been beyond the scope of the Board's ability to provide relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the second circumstance, the Board has advised administrative judges that they should exercise caution in ordering interim relief in cases where the appellants are receiving workers' compensation benefits or they are seeking an increase in the retirement benefits that they are receiving and the administrative costs required to prevent the appellants from receiving payment of monies in contravention of statutory authority would be unduly burdensome when weighed against the fact that the appellants are receiving some income. <span class="Italic">See Davis,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. at 96; <span class="Italic">Siu</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 396. In this appeal, the agency has failed to show that the administrative burden of insuring that the appellant does not improperly receive retirement benefits after being restored to paid status outweighs the hardship that the appellant has experienced by continuing to receive only retirement pay, which is approximately one half of his income while in paid status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant's motion to dismiss the agency's petition for review is granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the precedential value of the decision is unclear, <span class="Italic">Sink v. Dept. of Energy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SINK_JONATHAN_F_DE_0752_07_0333_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_372188.pdf">110 MSPR 153</a>, 160-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17, 2008 MSPB 231 (2008), suggested that interim relief may be inappropriate when the appellant who challenges an allegedly constructively adverse action is receiving a retirement annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of the statutory interim relief provision is not to make the appellant whole at the interim relief stage of the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 12. Rather, the intent of interim relief is to protect the appellant from hardship during the pendency of his appeal if he prevails in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It is a fundamental element of interim relief that the appellant be reinstated with pay effective as of the date of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Id. &#x00B6;</span> 13. However, the Board has found that there are circumstances where it is inappropriate to order interim relief. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chaney v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 1, 2-3 (1995) (the Board found that it need not address whether the agency had complied with the interim relief order in this involuntary retirement case stemming from the 1992-93 Postal Service reorganization, because the Board had stayed interim relief in this and similar such cases given its finding that interim relief was inappropriate under the circumstances of such cases), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 86 F.3d 1176 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Justice,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 92, 95-96 (interim relief should not be ordered if the appellant is receiving worker's compensation when the initial decision is issued; such relief could result in statutorily prohibited dual monetary payments, and the appellant would not be without an income absent interim relief), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 43 F.3d 1485 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Siu v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 394, 396 (1993) (interim relief generally should not be ordered in a retirement case involving a dispute over the amount of an annuity, since compliance would create an annuity overpayment if the initial decision does not withstand review, and the appellant is already receiving an annuity); <span class="Italic">see also Nadolski v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 105 F.3d 642, 643-45 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (finding that the Board had good cause to waive the procedural requirement that it dismiss an agency's petition for review for failure to submit evidence that it had provided appropriate interim relief because the Board had found that interim relief should not have been granted in this involuntary retirement appeal where the appellant's former position had been abolished in a reorganization and, even if the Board's waiver of the procedural requirement was defective, the agency was not obligated under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B) to recreate an unnecessary position that had been abolished in a reorganization).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the agency properly conducted a reorganization of its LM office, abolished the appellant's former position, and directly reassigned the appellant to a new position in the LM Headquarters Office in Washington, D.C., as part of that reorganization process. The AJ also found that the appellant rejected the directed reassignment and retired, with entitlement to an immediate retirement annuity, effective February 17, 2006. The appellant could have remained in a retirement status until the Board issued a final order directing the agency to cancel the appellant's retirement and to restore the appellant retroactive to the date of his retirement. The interim relief order required the agency to place the appellant in his former position, which had been abolished, and the appellant would not have suffered an undue hardship in waiting for the final order given that he was receiving a retirement annuity. We find that it was inappropriate to order the agency to provide interim relief given that the agency had abolished the appellant's former position and the appellant was receiving retirement annuity payments at the time of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Nadolski,</span> 105 F.3d at 644-45; <span class="Italic">Chaney,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 2-3. We therefore VACATE the interim relief order.</p>
