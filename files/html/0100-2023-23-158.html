<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-155"><span class="space">a.</span> Medical Limitation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mentioning or distinguishing the decisions discussed below, <span class="Italic">Milner v. USPS</span>, 118 MSPR 600, 601-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7, 2012 MSPB 111 (2012), established, or strongly implied, restrictions under the Rehabilitation Act, ADA and EEOC guidance concerning medical justifications offered for restoring an employee to a position other than the job held before an adverse action set aside by Board order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency placed the appellant on enforced leave from his position as a City Letter Carrier at the Pocoshock Creek Station after receiving correspondence from the appellant's treating psychologist stating that he may pose a danger to others in the workplace. On appeal, the Board reversed the action on the basis that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights. <span class="Italic">Milner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-10-0120-I-2, Final Order at 4 (July 8, 2011). The Board ordered the agency to return the appellant to duty with back pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4-5. The appellant submitted to a fitness-for-duty examination at the agency's direction, and once the appellant was cleared for duty, the agency returned him to work in a limited duty assignment at a different location, the Richmond Main Post Office. The appellant filed a petition for enforcement, and the administrative judge issued a compliance initial decision finding the agency in compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Instead of restoring the appellant to his former City Letter Carrier position at the Pocoshock Creek Station, the agency reassigned the appellant out of his bid assignment and placed him in a limited duty assignment at the Richmond Main Post Office. In its response to the petition for enforcement, the agency justified its action by explaining that it could not return the appellant to his former bid assignment because his old route at Pocoshock no longer exists. The agency further explained that, because the appellant's medical restrictions allow him to case, but not deliver mail, its best chance for finding him a full day's work was to place him in a limited duty assignment in the larger Richmond Main Post Office facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that, but for his suspension, he would have been entitled to bid pursuant to the applicable collective bargaining agreement on the junior Pocoshock carriers' routes after the agency abolished his former assignment. We agree and find that the appellant has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not a matter of harmless procedural error, as the compliance initial decision suggests; the agency's decision to deny the appellant his contractual rights based on his medical condition violates the Americans with Disabilities Act's (ADA)[2] restrictions on preemployment disability-related inquiries.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> 42<span class="Italic"></span> U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14; EEOC Enforcement Guidance, &#x00A7; B. When, as in this matter, the agency is already aware of the appellant's medical condition, it must take precautions to prevent the application and job offer process from being tainted by these matters, and under no circumstances may it use such information to prevent the appellant from bidding for assignments along with everyone else. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Enforcement Guidance, &#x00A7; B.4 &#x0026; n.37. The agency cannot use the occasion of the appellant's unlawful suspension simply to place him in an assignment of its own choosing. Even if the appellant is ultimately unable to perform the essential functions of any of the junior Pocoshock City Letter Carriers' routes, he must be allowed to bid on other assignments in accordance with his seniority under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. If the appellant is the winning bidder on any of those assignments, only then will it be appropriate to determine whether the appellant will be able to perform the essential functions of the position at issue, with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As a federal employee, the appellant's claim arises under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but the regulatory standards for the ADA have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act and are applied to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 271, &#x00B6; 10 n.3 (2012); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A "disability-related inquiry" is a question or series of questions that is likely to elicit information about a disability. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), "Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)," Notice No. 915.002, &#x00A7; B.1 (July 27, 2000) (Enforcement Guidance). Whether the appellant is actually "disabled" within the meaning of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which became effective on January 1, 2009, is immaterial because the restrictions regarding disability-related inquiries and medical examinations apply to all employees--not just to those with disabilities. <span class="Italic">See generally Addison v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC DOC 0120081932, *3 (2012).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pre-<span class="Italic">Milner,</span> whether concerns about an appellant's fitness provide the "strong, overriding" considerations for reassigning or detailing the employee upon reinstatement was explored in <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 361, 368 &#x00B6; 8 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On remand, the administrative judge should determine whether the agency had a strong overriding interest in proposing the appellant's detail to the lower graded position, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 MSPR 399, 401 (1995), bearing in mind that the fact that another employee occupied the position to which the appellant should have been restored does not establish a compelling reason for failing to restore the appellant. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy,</span> 57 MSPR 545, 556 (1993). Concerns about an appellant's fitness for duty may provide a compelling reason for not returning the appellant to his former position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Coffey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 533, 538, <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 22 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). However, agencies typically place a prevailing appellant in an administrative leave status pending the results of a fitness for duty examination<span class="Italic">. See, e.g. Connor v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 MSPR 389, 393 (1991). Any reliance on the agency's need to assess the appellant's physical and mental fitness to return to his permanent position should be supported by an explanation as to why such an assessment would have been unnecessary prior to detailing the appellant to the lower graded position....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Medical limitations justified reinstatement of an appellant to responsibilities <span id="Page_5001"></span>other than originally held by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Heidel v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 100, 103-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2009 MSPB 152 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has responded that it was improper for the agency to assign him the responsibility not to violate his medical restrictions because the agency was ordered to place him in a position for which he was qualified and he is not able to determine whether a task violates his restrictions because he is not a medical expert. The appellant also complained that it is not possible for him to comply with his medical restrictions and complete the duties of his assigned position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the instant case does not involve allegations of disability discrimination, the circumstances are analogous to the cases involving reasonable accommodation for a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In that context, the Board has held that an employee is not entitled to reassignment to the position of the employee's choice, but is only entitled to a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Henry v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6; 22 (2008); <span class="Italic">McConnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 163, 170 (1994). Here, although the appellant may desire an assignment to a particular position, to be in compliance with the Board's final order, the agency need only assign the appellant to a position for which he is qualified. The agency has restructured the appellant's current position by instructing him not to perform the duties normally associated with the position that exceed his medical restrictions. Thus, the appellant has been assigned duties that are within his medical restrictions and, therefore, a position for which he is qualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's contention that performing the duties of his assigned position requires him to exceed his medical restrictions, in the context of reasonable accommodation law, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has held that "once an employer accommodates an employee's limitations, the employee has the obligation to work safely within the accommodation provided by the agency and to work within her own limitations." <span class="Italic">Mercado v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941218, slip op. at 2 (Oct. 3, 1994); <span class="Italic">Richardson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01912009, slip op. at 10 (Aug. 29, 1991). In the <span class="Italic">Mercado</span> case, for example, the Commission found that the Postal Service had not failed to accommodate a postal clerk, who had been accommodated by being assigned to light-duty work within her medical restrictions, when the employee injured herself further while retrieving a package in excess of her medical restrictions and her supervisor's instructions. <span class="Italic">Mercado,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 1941218, slip op. at 1-2. Similarly, in the <span class="Italic">Richardson</span> decision, the Commission found that the Postal Service had reasonably accommodated a mail handler by modifying the duties of her position and the fact that the employee exceeded her restrictions and injured herself by improperly operating a piece of machinery did not establish that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the employee. Consistent with the EEOC's reasoning, we conclude that, because the agency has assigned the appellant to a position for which he is qualified, if the appellant exceeds his medical restrictions--and the instructions of his supervisor not to exceed those medical restrictions--the agency has not failed in its assignment obligations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we are not persuaded by the appellant's contention that he is not able to determine whether a task violates his restrictions because he is not a medical expert. The appellant's medical restrictions, which are set forth above, are such that they do not require medical expertise to understand. In fact, because the restrictions are not specific and definite but rather, call for the appellant to avoid certain acts "on a frequent basis," and to "decrease" other activities, in our view, there is no one better able than the appellant to understand whether a particular task on a particular day is within his restrictions.</p>

VA</span>, 112 MSPR 313, 317-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 2009 MSPB 149 (2009) ("Because of the appellant's medical limitations, the agency could not assign him to the exact duties he performed prior to his removal, but all of his assignments have been consistent with his housekeeping aid position and his medical limitations. Accordingly, the agency has shown that it had a compelling reason for assigning the appellant different duties after his reinstatement, and that his assignments have been substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties he performed prior to his removal."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Coles v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 412, 415 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2006 MSPB 66 (2006) (agency could require appellant to follow provisions of the collective bargaining agreement requiring a written request for light duty for an appellant who was ordered reinstated but who had physical limitations upon the work she could perform); <span class="Italic">Senior v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 283, 288 (2000) (agency was justified in removing employee who was to be restored pursuant to a Board order but who sustained an injury and could not work without a light duty assignment; the collective bargaining agreement required five years of service for a reassignment to permanent light duty). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 418, 424 &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (requiring agency to return employee to light duty, his status at the time of the resignation determined by the Board to be involuntary).

<p class="Body-Text">If at the time of a removal, the appellant was on a restricted schedule because of medical limitations apparently imposed by the appellant's doctor, on reinstatement, backpay is based on the restricted schedule, subject to later modification should the limitations be relaxed, <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-09-0172-C-1 (NP 3/25/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to place the appellant into the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the agency must return him to the same grade, pay, status, and tenure that he held before his removal. <span class="Italic">E.g., Rodriguez v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 279, 285 (1994). The record reflects that at the time that the agency removed the appellant, he had a work-related injury with permanent medical restrictions under which he could perform no more than 4 hours of work per day. The administrative judge found it undisputed that, after the agency cancelled the appellant's removal, it returned him to that same 4-hour per day pay status. Moreover, the administrative judge also found it undisputed that, once the appellant's physician released him to work for 6 hours each day for 2 weeks, and then for 8 hours per day, the agency paid the appellant accordingly. Thus, with regard to this issue, the record reflects that the agency appropriately returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> in accordance with the April 26, 2012 Opinion and Order canceling his removal.</p>
