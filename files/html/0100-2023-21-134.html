<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-133"><span class="space">1.</span> Process of Determining and Appealing LEO Status</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The enhanced benefit of early retirement treatment of law enforcement officers was explained in <span class="Italic">Eatmon v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 79 MSPR 96, 99-100 (1998) (vacated by reason of legislation granting LEO retirement status, <span class="Italic">Eatmon v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 84 MSPR 496 (1999)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under both CSRS and FERS, an employee in an LEO position becomes eligible for an annuity at a younger age, with fewer years of service, and that is computed at a higher rate, than an employee in a non-LEO position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8336(c), 8339(a), (d), 8412(d), (e), 8415(d). An employee in an LEO position is subject to mandatory retirement "on the last day of the month in which [he or she] becomes 57 years of age or completes 20 years of service if then over that age." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8335(b), 8425(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Law enforcement officer," for purposes of the CSRS, means:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Law enforcement officer," for purposes of FERS, means:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee, the duties of whose position (i) are primarily--(I) the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or (II) the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety; and (ii) are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals, as determined by [OPM] considering the recommendations of the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the CSRS and FERS definitions of "law enforcement officer" differ somewhat, the cases at issue turn on the common element of whether the appellants' duties are "primarily" "the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted" of violating federal criminal law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(20), 8401(17)(A).[2] <span class="Italic"> See Bingaman v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 127 F.3d 1431, 1433-40 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (applying both the CSRS and FERS definitions of "law enforcement officer").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The difference between the CSRS and FERS definitions of "law enforcement officer" could be relevant if any of the appellants claimed that their duties involved "the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A)(i)(II), but none of the appellants so claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richardson v. DOD</span>, 81 MSPR 217, 220-21 (1999), provided a general description of LEO retirement requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify for LEO service credit, an employee must show that he meets the statutory definition of a law enforcement officer, i.e., "an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c). "Investigation" for the purpose of meeting the definition of "law enforcement officer" refers to criminal investigations, i.e., the investigation of suspected or known criminals for the immediate purpose of prosecuting them, if warranted. Factors that distinguish criminal investigation from non-criminal investigation include unusual physical hazards for the investigator arising from frequent contacts with criminals or suspected criminals, working for long periods without a break, on-call status 24 hours a day, and carrying weapons. <span class="Italic">Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 241, 244 (1995). These duties must be the employee's primary duties which constitute the basic reason for the existence of the position, and must occupy a substantial portion of the employee's working time over a typical work cycle, and be assigned on a regular and recurring basis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The regulatory definition of "law enforcement officer" excludes "an employee whose primary duties involve maintaining law and order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than persons who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902. The appellant bears the burden of proving his entitlement to LEO service credit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Richardson, supra,</span> for CSRS employees, there is ordinarily a one-year limit on the retroactivity of an LEO service credit request, unless the agency head finds that the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making an earlier request. That time limit and other aspects of the LEO formulation were explained in <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, 81 MSPR 217, 220 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an employee covered by the CSRS, the appellant's request for LEO service credit is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 and 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart I. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(e), when an individual requests LEO service credit from his employing or former employing agency, coverage in a position or credit for past service will not be granted for a period greater than 1 year prior to the date that the request from an individual is received by the employing agency or the agency where past service was performed. An agency head may extend the time limit when the agency head determines that the individual showed that he was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from making the request within the time limit. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without discussing the issue of a waiver of the 1-year time limit, the agency, based on its statement that it received the appellant's request for LEO service credit in August 1996, limited its consideration of his service to the period between August 1995 and September 16, 1995, when the appellant transferred to another Federal agency. Although the administrative judge expanded the time period that he would consider, he stated that he would not review all of the appellant's service as a Police Officer because no regulation or statute requires that the agency inform the appellant of the 1-year filing requirement. As set forth more fully below, we find that none of the appellant's service in the Police Officer and the Police Officer (Office Automation) positions qualifies him for LEO service credit. Therefore, we decline to address the issue of whether he is entitled to a waiver of the 1-year time limit on the service to be considered.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation conferring Board jurisdiction over agencies' determinations regarding LEO retirement coverage under FERS provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he final decision of an agency denying an individual's request for approval of a position as a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller position made under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4283"></span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a). A "rigorous position" is a position whose primary duties are either those of a firefighter or a law enforcement officer. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. If an employee is in a position that is not subject to the higher withholding rate applicable to law enforcement officers, he must seek, formally and in writing, a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). If the employee does not seek such a determination within six months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This presumption may be rebutted by preponderant evidence that the employee was unaware of his status or was prevented by cause beyond his control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under sections 842.807(a) and 842.804(c), the Board's jurisdiction is limited to agency decisions made in response to employees' formal, written requests for LEO retirement coverage, and agency decisions cannot be challenged unless the requests were made within the six-month filing period, or unless preponderant evidence establishes good cause for the failure to make them in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">See DeVitto v. Department of Transportation,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 354, 357 (1994). Our examination of the record in these appeals shows the existence of a final agency decision that determined that the appellants were not entitled to LEO retirement coverage, but we find nothing in the record to indicate when or if any of the appellants submitted a formal, written request for LEO retirement coverage. A remand to the regional office for resolution of this issue is therefore necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">On remand, the administrative judge shall substitute the Department of Defense for the Department of the Navy as the defending agency in these appeals</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board review of an administrative determination of LEO retirement coverage is limited to a final agency decision, which must be made by an "agency head." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.807(a), .803(a). An agency head is defined, for executive branch agencies, as the head of an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105, or the designated representative of the head of an executive department as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101, except that for provisions dealing with law enforcement officers and firefighters, the designated official must be a department headquarters-level official who reports directly to the executive department head and who is the sole such representative for the entire department. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. An executive agency is defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 as "an executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment," and the executive departments are defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101 as including the Department of Defense, but not the Department of the Navy, which is defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 102 as a "military department." Accordingly, only the Secretary of Defense, or his designated department headquarters-level official, was authorized to make a final agency decision regarding the appellants' LEO retirement coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with these provisions, the final agency decision concerning the appellants' entitlement to LEO retirement coverage was made by the Assistant Secretary of Defense, the Secretary's department headquarters-level designee. In communicating that decision to various Human Resources Offices, the Navy's Office of Civilian Personnel Management correctly advised that the Department of Defense would be the defending agency in appeals to the Board, not the Department of the Navy. Nevertheless, the administrative judge's order acknowledging the filing of these appeals identified the Department of the Navy as the defending agency, and was mailed to the Human Resources Office at the Naval Air Warfare Center, which has represented the government throughout the proceedings to date. On remand, the administrative judge shall substitute the Department of Defense for the Department of the Navy as the defending agency in these appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The process for qualifying for law enforcement annuity service credit and contributions was also described for FERS participants in <span class="Italic">Caponio v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 633, 635-36 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Service in a position that the agency has determined to be a rigorous law enforcement officer or firefighter position is covered under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(d), which entitle an employee to enhanced retirement benefits, and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422 (a)(2)(B), which require a higher retirement withholding rate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.803(a). In order to receive law enforcement officer service credit under FERS, if an employee is in a position whose basic pay is not subject to the higher retirement withholding rate applicable to law enforcement officers, he must seek formally and in writing a determination from his employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate. If the employee does not seek such a determination within 6 months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, the agency's determination that the employee's service was not so covered is presumed to be correct. The employee may rebut that presumption by preponderant evidence that he was unaware of his status or was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from requesting that his official status be changed at the time of his service in the position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c). The Board has jurisdiction to hear appeals of agency denials of law enforcement officer service credit, so long as the employee made the request for a determination from the agency within the 6-month time period or shows that he was unaware of his status or was prevented by circumstances beyond his control from requesting a change of official status. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.807(a), 842.804(c); <span class="Italic">DeVitto v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that a statutory or regulatory deadline may be waived when: 1) The statute or regulation itself specifies the circumstances in which the time limit may be waived; 2) the agency's affirmative misconduct precludes it from enforcing an otherwise applicable rule under the doctrine of equitable estoppel; or 3) the agency fails to provide notification of the deadline as required by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 602, 605-06 (1991). The administrative judge found that the appellants were entitled to a waiver based on the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c), i.e., they were prevented by circumstances beyond their control from requesting a change in status, because the agency informed them consistently and repeatedly that they were not entitled to LEO benefits, including LEO retirement credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellant Read's unrebutted testimony shows that no one at the agency informed her that she could request a change of status or of the procedures for doing so, we find that such circumstance does not justify waiver of the 6-month time limit for making a request. Neither the statute nor OPM's regulations place a duty to inform employees of such a right to request a change in status on employing agencies. Thus, lack of notice does not excuse the failure to make a timely request. We find that appellant Read did not timely request a change in her LEO status; that waiver of the time limit under the criteria of <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 605-06, is not warranted; and that the Board thus lacks jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.807(a), 842.804(c); <span class="Italic">Caponio</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 636; <span class="Italic">DeVitto</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 357.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Scott v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 71 MSPR 42, 45-46 (1996) (describing FERS LEO process).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Slater v. DHS</span>, SF-3443-15-0322-I-1 (NP 1/21/2016), the agency's failure to timely decide an LEO retirement status request can vest appellate jurisdiction in the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over a claim for FERS LEO retirement credit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), which provides that "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United <span id="Page_4284"></span>States under the provisions of this chapter administered by the Office [of Personnel Management] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." <span class="Italic">Slater v. General Services Administration</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6; 10 (2004), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by McNeil v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 146 (2005). The agency has not issued a decision concerning the appellant's request for LEO retirement credit since August 24, 2001, when it issued the denial letter that led to his 2001 Board appeal. However, the appellant has since renewed his request for LEO retirement credit, citing an alleged change in the duties of his position. Under these circumstances, to dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on the agency's failure to issue a new decision would effectively prevent him from obtaining adjudication of his claim. <span class="Italic">Cf. McLaughlin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 536, 546 (1994) (finding jurisdiction over retirement appeal where the agency's failure to issue a decision on the appellant's retirement application amounted to a constructive denial), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 47 F.3d 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). We therefore find that the appellant's claim for LEO retirement credit lies within our jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once the Board makes a LEO determination, coverage remains in effect unless there is a change in duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Setevage v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 636, 638 (1986) ("The first issue in this compliance matter is whether OPM should be required to give the Board's final order continuing effect as long as there is no change in the appellant's duties. We find that OPM is so required. Our finding is based upon the scope of the Board's enforcement authority and upon the nature of the decision which was appealed to the Board in this case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is without jurisdiction to review an agency decision not to exempt an employee from mandatory law enforcement retirement, and no appeal lies indirectly to OPM on the same basis, <span class="Italic">Conway v. OPM</span>, 19 MSPR 25, 27 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Department of the Army</span>, 9 MSPB 63 (1982), the Board specifically considered the question of whether a determination to separate an employee under Section 8335(b) is an appealable action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8347(d) and concluded that Congress intended that Section 8347(d) only provide for appeals to the Board from final decisions of the Office of Personnel Management in retirement matters. <span class="Italic">Lawrence, supra</span>, at 64. Therefore, the Board held that it was without jurisdiction to consider an <span class="Italic">agency</span> decision not to exempt an employee from the mandatory retirement provisions of Section 8335(b). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's decision not to apply for the retirement annuity for which he is eligible, and his assertion that he should have been reassigned are likewise not appealable to the Board because the action affecting appellant is his separation pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8335(b). Moreover, OPM's erroneous statement of appeal rights in its reconsideration decision does not serve to confer jurisdiction upon this Board.</p>
