<h2 class="h2" id="sec1-266"><span class="space">V.</span> APPEAL RIGHTS BASED ON MILITARY SERVICE AND VETERANS PREFERENCE</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">The Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified, as amended, at 38 USC 4301-4333) (USERRA), prohibiting discrimination as to terms and conditions of federal civilian employment because of an individual's present or past or future military service, and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), involving application of statutes and regulations creating and applying veterans preference, present complexities to the Board and to litigants, frequently <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. Board VEOA and USERRA jurisdiction tends to involve complex analysis; many decisions concern statutory or regulatory coverage, exhaustion of Department of Labor administrative remedies, and the timeliness of appeals. The numbers of VEOA and USERRA cases annually increase. More information on USERRA and VEOA can be found in Joyce Kitchens' <span class="Italic">USERRA/VEOA Deskbook</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/12UVD.html">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2012). Guidance is provided by Veterans' Employment Redress Laws in the Federal Civil Service (MSPB Office of Policy and Evaluation 2014). <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Veterans_Employment_Redress_Laws_in_the_Federal_Civil_Service_1103655.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Veterans_Employment_Redress_Laws_in_the_Federal_Civil_Service_1103655.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier discussion concerned the importance of veterans preference in the definition of an "employee" under 5 USC 7511 for purposes of Board jurisdiction over an adverse action or performance-based action. Laws governing veterans preference extend beyond the definition of an employee for purposes of establishing Board appeal rights to the creation of hiring preferences for applicants for employment. USERRA establishes employment restoration rights to defined servicemembers and precludes discrimination or retaliation based on defined military service or the exercise of rights associated with veterans preference or covered military service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing complex statutes, under <span class="Italic">Anderson v. VA</span>, AT-3330-14-0254-I-1 (NP 12/23/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be entitled to relief under VEOA, an appellant must show by preponderant evidence that the agency violated one or more of her statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). To prevail on the merits of a USERRA claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a),[3] an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that her uniformed service was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency action. <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 19 (2013). If the appellant makes that showing, the agency can avoid liability by showing, as an affirmative defense, that it would have taken the same action for a valid reason without regard to her uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant did not allege, nor does it appear that by its actions the agency violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) which prohibits an agency from discriminating or retaliating against a person because she has: (1) taken an action to enforce a protection afforded under chapter 38; (2) testified or otherwise made a statement in or connection with any proceeding under chapter 38; (3) assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under chapter 38; or (4) exercised a right provided for in chapter 38.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The purposes of the USERRA and VEOA, the substantive distinctions between the statutes, and some procedural elements of the statutes, were described in <span class="Italic">Hillman v. TVA</span>, 95 MSPR 162, 165-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-16 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...These separate statutory schemes protect different rights, impose different jurisdictional requirements for an appeal to the Board, and include different elements to establish a claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's USERRA claim</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a] person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). An individual who believes that he has been the victim of a violation of this statutory prohibition may file an appeal with the Board. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b). In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal, the appellant must allege that: (1) He performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to the performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v.

A claim under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">Tindall,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 230 &#x00B6; 6.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects, and the agency does not dispute, that the appellant is a veteran. He also stated in his initial appeal form that he was an active member of the Alabama National Guard and submitted a copy of orders dated June 10, 2001, to report to Fort Lewis, Washington, for annual training. The appellant further alleged in the section of the appeal form regarding discrimination that his membership in the National Guard was discussed in his interview. He also enclosed with his appeal a letter to U.S. Representative Robert Adherholt, in which he charged the agency with "utilizing the interview process to discriminate against veterans" and stated, "I am an active member of the Alabama Army National Guard and could be called up for war anytime now." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find that the appellant has alleged that: he performed duty and has an obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service; he was denied initial employment, reemployment, or a benefit of employment; and the denial was on the basis of his military status and/or obligation to perform military service. <span class="Italic">See Lazard v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 337 &#x00B6; 5 (2003). An allegation that an employer took or failed to take certain actions based on an individual's military status or obligations in violation of USERRA constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation entitling the appellant to Board consideration of his claim, and the weakness of the assertions in support of a claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA claim for lack of jurisdiction. Rather, if the appellant fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on its merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge recognized that the appellant may have been alleging discrimination in federal employment on account of military service, he did not apprise the appellant of the particular burden and methods of proof on his claim of discrimination based on his prior military service. In appeals brought under USERRA, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action. If the appellant meets that burden, the agency must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the action would have been taken for a valid reason despite the protected status. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The appellant may prove that his military status was a motivating or substantial factor by direct or indirect evidence, but when the employee has met his burden, "the burden shifts to the employer to prove...that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced the employer to take the same adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1014. The Board has held that an administrative judge must inform an appellant who files a USERRA claim of the USERRA burden and methods of proof announced in <span class="Italic">Sheehan,</span> and must provide the appellant with an opportunity to submit evidence and argument to meet the USERRA burden and methods of proof as set forth in <span class="Italic">Sheehan.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant requested a hearing. The Board's regulation regarding USERRA appeals provides that "[a] hearing may be provided to the appellant once the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal is established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.13(b).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's VEOA claim</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA affords a preference eligible, who asserts that an agency has violated his rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, a right to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, and then to file an appeal of the alleged violation with the Board if he has exhausted his DOL remedy. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d). To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal brought under the VEOA, an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the action(s) at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a; <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377 &#x00B6; 6 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant is entitled to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(B), (3)(B). He asserted in his appeal that the agency failed to apply veterans' preference law to the selection at issue. To meet the exhaustion requirement, the appellant must show that he filed a VEOA complaint with the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) within 60 days of the alleged violation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A). The Board cannot consider a VEOA appeal where it is undisputed that the appellant submitted his complaint to DOL beyond the 60-day statutory deadline and DOL rejected the complaint as untimely without considering its substance. <span class="Italic">Bagunas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 5 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 13 (2002). Additionally, with respect to the exhaustion requirement, the appellant must show either: (1) that he received notification from the Secretary that the Secretary was unable to resolve the complaint; or, (2) that the Secretary was unable to resolve the VEOA complaint within 60 days after the date on which the complaint was filed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2), (d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(2) provides that where the Secretary has not resolved the complaint within 60 days, an appeal to the Board "may not be brought unless...the complainant first provides written notification to the Secretary of such complainant's intent to bring such appeal" and provides the Board with evidence of compliance with this statutory requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(5)(ii). On remand, the appellant must therefore submit a copy a letter from DoL informing him that it was unable to resolve any complaint or evidence showing that he notified the Secretary of his intent to bring a VEOA appeal to the Board if the Secretary has not yet resolved any complaint filed by the appellant on the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(5)(i) &#x0026; (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the interest of assuring that the appellant has a full opportunity to present evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over this VEOA appeal, we are remanding the matter for further adjudication. On remand, the appellant must present evidence that he filed a VEOA complaint with the DOL within 60 days of the alleged violation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A). He must show that the Secretary notified him that the Secretary was unable to resolve the complaint, or show that the Secretary was unable to resolve the VEOA complaint within 60 days after the date on which he filed the complaint. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2), (d)(1). If the Secretary was unable to resolve the complaint within 60 days, the appellant must establish that he notified the Secretary of his intent to file a Board appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)-(2). The appellant must make nonfrivolous allegations that he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, the action(s) at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a; <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377 &#x00B6; 6. Additionally, the appellant must establish that his appeal was timely filed with the Board. That is, that he filed his Board appeal no later than 15 days after he received the Secretary's notice that the Secretary was unable to resolve the complaint, or that he did not file his Board appeal before the 61st day after the date on which he filed his VEOA complaint with the DOL. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, in closing, that positions with the agency are in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See Dodd v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 770 F.2d 1038, 1040 (Fed.

Thus, any veterans' preference rights regarding selection and appointment to a position with the agency that the appellant might have are provided by statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3320, 3308-3318, or by regulation at 5 C.F.R. part 302. If on remand the appellant shows that his VEOA appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction and is not time barred, he must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency's selection violated one or more of these statutory or regulatory provisions.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal,<span id="Page_434"></span> an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DoL and (2) make non-frivolous allegations that: (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the action(s) at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a; <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 10 (2004). To satisfy the exhaustion requirement, a preference eligible employee may file a Board appeal within 15 days after the date on which he received written notification of the results of DoL's investigation of the complaint or, if DoL was unable to resolve the complaint within 60 days, an appeal may be filed after 60 days from the date on which the complaint was filed with DoL. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1); <span class="Italic">Wooten</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant, a preference-eligible, has submitted evidence suggesting that he filed a VEOA complaint with DoL on May 6, 2007, although the contents of the purported complaint are mostly illegible. When the administrative judge issued the initial decision on July 5, 2007, the appellant had not alleged that he had received notification from DoL that it was unable to resolve the complaint, and 60 days had not passed since the appellant filed the complaint. The Board therefore lacked jurisdiction over the VEOA appeal at that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, "[i]f the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a [VEOA] complaint...within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the" Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.22(a). However, where the Secretary of Labor has not resolved the complaint within 60 days, an appeal to the Board "may not be brought unless...the complainant first provides written notification to the Secretary of such complainant's intention to bring such appeal" and provides the Board with evidence of compliance with this statutory requirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(5)(ii). Although 60 days have elapsed since the appellant's May 6, 2007 submission to DoL, he has not alleged that he provided written notification to the Secretary of Labor of his intent to file a Board appeal. The appellant's submission on petition for review of two letters to DoL, dated July 2 and August 9, 2007, are insufficient to establish that he has provided written notification to the Secretary of his intent to bring a Board appeal.

Because the appellant has not shown that he exhausted his administrative remedies with DoL under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(2), he has not established Board jurisdiction over his VEOA appeal. The administrative judge's dismissal of the appellant's VEOA appeal for lack of jurisdiction is therefore affirmed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's USERRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal arising under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), the appellant must allege that: (1) He performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to the performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Hillman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 5 (2003).[2] Unlike the jurisdictional requirements of VEOA, an appellant may file a USERRA complaint directly with the Board without filing a complaint with DoL. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(1). Nevertheless, where, as here, an appellant seeks the assistance of the Secretary of Labor by filing a USERRA complaint with DoL before filing an appeal with the Board, he must exhaust his administrative remedies before DoL prior to submitting his USERRA complaint to the Board. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Milner v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 37, 47 (1997). Moreover, whereas an appellant may be considered to have exhausted his administrative remedies in a VEOA appeal if the Secretary is unable to resolve his complaint within 60 days after the complaint was filed, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1), USERRA does not provide for exhaustion before DoL as a matter of time; it instead requires notification from DoL that the Secretary's efforts did not resolve the appellant's complaint, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.11(b).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant has alleged that he raised his USERRA claims in a complaint to DoL, he has not alleged that he received the requisite notification from DoL that the Secretary of Labor's efforts failed to resolve his complaint. Therefore, because the appellant has not established Board jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal, the administrative judge's dismissal of the USERRA appeal is affirmed.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">USERRA or VEOA cases involve a claim for a benefit improperly denied under one or both of the statutes.

Those allegations may also surface as affirmative defenses in other types of cases, e.g., adverse action appeals. <span class="Italic">Holmes v.

We must examine, however, whether the Board's USERRA jurisdiction provides an alternative basis to &#x00A7; 7701 to find that the appellant's allegation that the agency's action violated USERRA was timely filed.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although VEOA and USERRA are separate statutes, the objects of the statutory schemes are related, and the Board tends to treat the statutes as interrelated. The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> devotes Chapter 18 to a description of the operation of the two laws:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Statutes</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USERRA</span>. The most commonly brought claim USERRA is that a person was denied a "benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of...membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation" with respect to a uniformed service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). As explained below, however, two other provisions of the law can also form the basis for a USERRA appeal. The Board has jurisdiction over appeals from any action taken by a Federal employer contrary to the requirements of the law. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VEOA</span>. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a, the Board's jurisdiction under the VEOA extends to the appeal of a preference eligible who alleges that, on or after October 31, 1998, there was a violation of any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference with respect to Federal employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). The law also provides jurisdiction as to certain claims of denial of the opportunity to compete for positions, as more fully discussed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The procedures applicable to cases brought under these laws are set out at 5 C.F.R. part 1208. In addition, except as expressly provided in that part, the Board will apply subparts A, B, C, and F of part 1201. According to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.3, it will also apply the provisions of subpart H of part 1201 regarding attorney fee awards. However, subsequent case law suggests that, at least for the most part, this statement has been rendered incorrect. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 13, section 2.d of this Handbook, discussing <span class="Italic">Jacobsen v. Department of Justice</span>, 500 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007), which states that "Congress left the decision whether to award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses to the Board's discretion," so that the rules developed under &#x00A7; 7701 may not fully apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USERRA</span>. Three separate claims may be brought under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) provides that "[a] person who is a <span id="Page_435"></span>member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation." To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal alleging a violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), the appellant must show that he performed, applied to perform, or was obligated to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; and make nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) he was not separated from uniformed service with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions, and was not dismissed under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1061(a) or dropped from the rolls pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1161(b); (2) he lost a benefit of employment or any of the rights protected by USERRA; and (3) the performance, application to perform, or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service was a substantial or motivating factor in the loss of the right or benefit. Nonetheless, an appellant need not explicitly invoke USERRA to raise a valid claim under the law. <span class="Italic">McAfee v. Social Security Administration</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 4 (2001). A claim should be "broadly and liberally" construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 545 (2000). Although the appellant has the burden of proof, once he has presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency may then attempt to avoid relief by showing that it would have taken the same action despite the appellant's military service. A claim may not be raised relating to benefits under the Thrift Savings Plan. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4322(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) provides for redress as to a claim of discrimination or retaliation because a person "(1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under [38 U.S.C. chapter 43], (2) has testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under [that] chapter, (3) has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under [that] chapter, or (4) has exercised a right provided for in [that] chapter." In a USERRA discrimination or retaliation appeal, the agency's intent must be proven. Unlike section 4311(a), this prohibition against retaliation applies regardless of whether the person has performed service in the uniformed services. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal alleging a violation of this provision of USERRA, the appellant must make nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) he took action to enforce a protection afforded any person under chapter 43 of title 38 of the U.S. Code, gave testimony or made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under that chapter, rendered assistance or otherwise participated in an investigation under that chapter, or exercised a right provided for in that chapter; and (2) his action was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency action that he claims is discrimination or retaliation. The agency may then attempt to show that it would have taken the same action absent the appellant's protected action. An appellant claiming that he was discriminated against based on a disability arising from his military service will not establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Mims v. Social Security Administration</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 213, 225 (2013); <span class="Italic">McBride v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 411, 415 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 grant certain reemployment rights after uniformed service. A person who claims that the agency failed to meet its reemployment obligations must not have been separated from uniformed service with a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge or under other than honorable conditions, dismissed under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1061(a), or dropped from the rolls pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1161(b); further, in most instances, "the person [must have] given advance written or verbal notice of such service to such person's employer." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a)(1). A person claiming a right to reemployment under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 also must show that he was not absent in excess of five years after the December 12, 1994 effective date of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a)(2) and did not abandon his civilian employment in favor of a military career. The 5-year period, however, may be extended for the several reasons set out in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(c). Unlike USERRA discrimination cases, it is the agency that bears the burden of proof in reemployment cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">As to all USERRA appeals, the claim should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). The weakness of the assertions in support of the claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Rather, if the appellant fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on its merits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span class="Italic">Butterbaugh appeals</span>--a subset of section 4311(a) appeals involves claims based on improperly charged military leave. Prior to the 2000 amendment to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323, the government's standard practice was to charge guard and reserve members military leave for every day they were away on guard or military training duty, even if they were not scheduled to work some of those days. However, in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the court held that this practice was contrary to section 6323 and constituted the denial of a benefit of employment in violation of USERRA. In <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of State</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 172 (2006), the Board held that it has jurisdiction under USERRA, as amended by the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998, to adjudicate allegations of improper military leave charges by employing agencies, even if they concern military leave denials predating the enactment of USERRA. It limited relief, though, to reimbursement for any civilian leave that the appellant was required to use as a result of an improper charge of military leave. However, because military leave afforded by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a) is a benefit of employment, the court in <span class="Italic">Pucilowski v. Department of Justice</span>, 498 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007), reversed the Board's holding that it lacked the authority to order the correction of records to reflect a proper accounting of the appellant's military leave. Nonetheless, the Board still imposes strict proof requirements on the appellant in these cases, which the court has upheld. In doing so, though, the court has stated that "while not legally obligated to do so, agencies may resolve claims for improper military leave charges by providing more compensation than an individual has been able to prove." <span class="Italic">Pucilowski</span>, 498 F.3d at 1345. Because agencies are now aware of the legal requirements concerning their charging of leave, few <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> cases are filed, and those that are may be subject to settlement in light of the requirements of that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VEOA</span>. Two separate claims may be brought under VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A) provides that a jurisdictional claim under the VEOA is one that a Federal agency violated a preference eligible's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. To establish VEOA jurisdiction over an appeal concerning a complaint filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), the appellant must establish that he exhausted his Department of Labor remedy and make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the actions at issue occurred on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. "Preference eligible" is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3). Although 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(a)(3) states that the appellant must also identify the statute or regulation that allegedly was violated, explain how it was violated, and state the date of the violation, the Board has stated that an appeal should not be dismissed for the sole reason that the appellant fails to identify a specific law or regulation relating to veterans' preference that he or she believes was violated. <span class="Italic">See Young v. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) states that preference eligibles and, contrary to the general VEOA rule, veterans,<span class="Italic"> see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1), who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures. That the agency did not, in fact, consider any external candidates does not defeat the claim to consideration. <span class="Italic">Boctor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 580 (2009). Such persons have the right to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) and subsequently file an appeal with the Board. To establish the Board's VEOA jurisdiction over an appeal concerning a complaint filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B), the appellant must establish that he exhausted his Department of Labor remedy and make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a veteran described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) or a preference eligible, (ii) the agency denied him the opportunity to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce, and (iii) the denial occurred on or <span id="Page_436"></span>after the December 10, 2004 enactment date of the law that provides this right. <span class="Italic">See Styslinger v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223 (2007); <span class="Italic">Jolley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 104 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Subsection 4, below, addresses the exhaustion and timeliness requirements that are also prerequisites to VEOA appeals. <span class="Italic">See Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208 (2001); <span class="Italic">Smyth v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 219 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 41 F.

<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Affirmative Defenses</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it lacks authority, under both USERRA and VEOA, to hear any affirmative defense where the jurisdictional basis for the appeal is USERRA or VEOA itself. <span class="Italic">See Metzenbaum v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 285 (2001) (USERRA); <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 396 (2001) (VEOA). Although the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span> 479 F.3d 830 (Fed. Cir. 2007), discusses the applicability of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 to USERRA and VEOA appeals, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604 (2007), the Board reaffirmed the conclusions in <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum</span> and <span class="Italic">Ruffin</span> and held that it continues to lack jurisdiction to consider claims of prohibited personnel practices in cases brought under both statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time Limitations, Timeliness, and Exhaustion</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USERRA</span>. The law applies to any appeal filed on or after October 14, 1994, without regard to whether the alleged violation occurred before, on, or after that date. However, the substantive provisions of USERRA are not retroactive beyond October 14, 1994, i.e., they do not make illegal any act or conduct that was not prohibited prior to that date, but when an agency's action violated a substantive provision that was in effect prior to that date, the claim is cognizable under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 109 (1999). Under the law, the appellant may file an appeal directly with the Board or may first seek relief from the Secretary of Labor. If the appellant chooses the latter course, that remedy must be exhausted by awaiting notification from the Secretary that the complaint has not been resolved. Whether the appellant files directly with the Board or goes first to the Secretary of Labor, there is no time limit for filing a Board appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.12. The Board has also held that if the appeal raising the USERRA issue concerns an "otherwise appealable matter" but it is untimely under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, it should be treated strictly as a USERRA appeal to avoid the time limit. <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of Justice</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 377 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VEOA</span>. The law applies only to violations of veterans' preference rights that happened on or after October 31, 1998. Unlike USERRA, VEOA contains specific exhaustion and timely filing requirements. The exhaustion provisions of VEOA require the appellant first to seek a remedy from the Secretary of Labor, within 60 days of the date of the alleged violation, and to allow the Secretary at least 60 days to resolve the complaint. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.21. Then the Secretary of Labor must have sent the appellant written notification that efforts to resolve the complaint were unsuccessful or at least 60 days must have elapsed from the date the complaint was filed if no written notification had yet been issued. In the latter situation, the appellant must have provided written notification to the Secretary of Labor of the intent to file an appeal with the Board to have exhausted the administrative remedies with DOL. If the appellant has received notice from the Secretary, the appeal must be filed within 15 days from receipt. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 330a(d)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board had previously held that the time limit for filing an appeal under VEOA may not be waived for good cause shown; that the Board cannot consider a VEOA appeal when it is undisputed that the appellant submitted his complaint to the Department of Labor beyond the 60-day statutory deadline and Labor rejected the complaint as untimely without considering its substance; and that it lacks the authority to determine whether the Secretary of Labor should have waived the deadline. However, in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> the court held that the time limits under VEOA, both to file with the Secretary of Labor and to file an appeal with the Board from the decision of the Secretary, are subject to equitable tolling. Thus, the Board's regulations now provide that in extraordinary circumstances, both the appellant's 60-day deadline for filing with the Secretary of Labor and the 15-day deadline for filing an appeal with the Board are subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling when, despite having diligently pursued his or her appeal rights, the appellant was unable to make a timely filing with the Board due to deception by the opposing party or where the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1208.21(b), 1208.22(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;For both USERRA and VEOA appeals that are dismissed without prejudice, case law mandates that refiling be done automatically by the RO or FO rather than burden the appellant with the timeliness concern. <span class="Italic">See Milner v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (USERRA); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 13 (2009) (VEOA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Representation</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA, the Special Counsel may represent the appellant. The appellant must first have requested that the Secretary of Labor refer the complaint to OSC. Any written statement that the Secretary did so, and that the Special Counsel agreed to be the representative, will be accepted as the written designation of representative required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31(a).<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Hearing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USERRA</span>: Here, too, <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> has changed the law. While the Board had previously stated that the AJ may grant a hearing request once jurisdiction over the appeal is established, the court held that a USERRA appellant has the right to a hearing, so that "any veteran who requests a hearing shall receive one." Thus, the Board lacks authority to deny a hearing request on a complaint filed under USERRA, once the appellant has established Board jurisdiction over the appeal. Indeed, the AJ may grant a hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.13(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VEOA</span>: The rule that a hearing is required does not apply to VEOA. Here, the court did not discuss the Board's regulation specifying that if the appellant requests a hearing, the AJ may grant the request once jurisdiction over the appeal is established. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(b). The Board then held in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604 (2007), that it retains the authority to grant or deny a hearing in a VEOA appeal even after the court's decision "once the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal is established and it has been determined that the appeal is timely." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.23(b). Although the regulation does not set out requirements for the hearing, the Board has held that if the appellant establishes a genuine dispute of material fact, he is entitled to a hearing under VEOA. Therefore, if the appellant requests a hearing, when there are significant factual issues that must be resolved, when it appears that the resolution of those issues can best be accomplished through the testimony of witnesses who will be subject to examination and cross-examination, and when there are likely to be issues of credibility to resolve in deciding the merits issues, the AJ should likely grant a hearing. The Board has stated that if the written submissions show that there is "a factual dispute material to the appellant's VEOA claims," a hearing should be granted, but that a hearing is not appropriate when the only VEOA issues to be resolved are legal matters. <span class="Italic">See Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 11 (2001). If there is no hearing in an appeal when any of those factors may apply, the AJ should document the record explaining why the hearing is not necessary, so that the Board will know the bases for the AJ's exercise of discretion if a party files a PFR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Burdens of Proof</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USERRA</span>. If the claim at issue is under section 4311(a), the appellant must show by preponderant evidence that his uniformed service was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's decision to take the action in question. The exception to this rule is that if it is undisputed that the agency took the challenged action only because of the appellant's military service, for example by denying leave for a military obligation, he must show instead that he was denied a benefit of employment under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For claims under section 4311(b), the appellant must show that his protected activity under 38 U.S.C. chapter 43 was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged discrimination or retaliation. Then, the agency must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status. Thus, the burden of proof is not that of title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but that set forth in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Transportation Management Corporation</span>, 462 U.S. 393, 401 (1983). <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Fox v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 381 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In contrast, a USERRA reemployment claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 does not depend on the agency's motivation, and it is the agency that bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it met its statutory obligations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">VEOA</span>. See section 2b of this chapter, above. In the context of a VEOA appeal when the appellant claimed that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), which proscribes certain acts if they would violate a veterans' preference requirement, that to establish that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), the appellant would have to show that an agency employee knowingly took, recommended, or approved, or knowingly failed to take, recommend, or approve, a personnel action that violated a veterans' preference requirement. <span class="Italic">Villamarzo v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 159 (2002). <span id="Page_437"></span>Section 2302(e)(1) lists several statutes that constitute a "veterans' preference requirement" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), which makes it a prohibited personnel practice to take, fail to take, or recommend certain actions in violation of a "veterans preference requirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Elections to Terminate</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under VEOA, an appellant may, at any time beginning on the 121st day after filing a Board appeal, and in the absence of a judicially reviewable Board decision, elect to terminate the Board proceeding. In lieu of the Board appeal, the appellant may file a civil action in an appropriate U.S. District Court. The termination, which is effective immediately on receipt, must be filed with the AJ and served on the other parties. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.24(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite its automatic effective date, a termination order must be issued to document the termination, and to specify its effective date. Because the Board does not consider it to be either an initial or final Board decision, it is subject to neither a PFR nor a PFE, and is also not appropriate for judicial review by the Federal Circuit. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.24(b). Thus, the normal review rights that accompany IDs should not be provided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No similar provision for short-cutting the appellate process is available under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">9.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional Appeals</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USERRA</span>. Nothing in the statute prevents the filing of a claimed violation of USERRA in an appeal under any other law, rule, or regulation. Rather than being the cause of action, though, the Board will treat the claim as an affirmative defense that the agency's action was not in accordance with the law. <span class="Italic">See Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 1 (1999). Although this decision was overruled in part by <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, as to the burden of proof issue, its rulings concerning the manner in which USERRA as an affirmative defense will be treated remain valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Looked at differently, in <span class="Italic">Russell v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 14 (2006), the Board noted that while 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) generally requires an employee to elect between filing a grievance under a CBA, filing a Board appeal, or seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b) prohibits "any contract, agreement...or other matter" limiting an appellant's right to bring a USERRA claim before the Board. The Board concluded that the exclusivity provision of section 7121(g) must fall in the face of the USERRA requirement, as essentially, an "other matter." USERRA supersedes the CBA and permits the appellant to bring an appeal of a matter that is not otherwise appealable outside of USERRA, i.e., one concerning the location at which she was reemployed after her military service ended. However, in <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Department of Justice</span>, 486 F.3d 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Federal Circuit addressed a question the Board specifically left open, and held that where the appellant filed a grievance of his removal, which was an otherwise appealable matter under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, he was barred by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e) from bringing the same claim to the Board under USERRA. The court concluded that the appellant's USERRA claims as to his removal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311(a) and 4316(c) are "similar matters which arise under other personnel systems" that he had previously elected to raise under the negotiated grievance procedure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e). In its nonprecedential decision in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, <span class="Italic">Russell v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 324 F. App'x 872, 875 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the court discussed both of those decisions and found that while <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> involved a case where the appellant could elect to file a grievance, <span class="Italic">Russell</span> was bound by the CBA to file a grievance but that the "CBA grievance procedure mechanisms clearly fall within the meaning of a 'contract, agreement...or other matter' that cannot 'reduce, limit, or eliminate' a petitioner's right to bring a USERRA reemployment claim at the Board. Thus, as required by the plain language of section 4302(b), Russell's statutory right to appeal the reemployment matter to the Board is not affected by the CBA's requirement that she file a grievance because the CBA cannot impose a requirement that the employee grieve a USERRA matter. USERRA's legislative history also confirms this result. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep No. 103-65, at 20 (1993), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2453.'"</p>

The statute specifies that, as an alternative to filing an appeal under VEOA, an appellant may pursue redress in a direct appeal to the Board from any action that is appealable under any other law, rule, or regulation. The appellant may not, however, pursue both an appeal under such other law, rule, or regulation and one under VEOA at the same time. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(e)(1), (2). In <span class="Italic">Sears v. Department of the Navy</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 31, 34, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 6 (2001), the Board explained that this provision means that a preference eligible who is separated by RIF may pursue a claimed violation of his or her preference rights through the 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a process, but cannot also pursue the claimed violation through a RIF appeal to the Board. On the contrary, however, in the same case, the Board found preclusion was inapplicable when the appellant was pursuing both a VEOA appeal claiming that his veterans' preference rights were violated when the agency separated him to hire a nonveteran, and a USERRA appeal, in which he claimed that he had been separated because of his veteran status. Only the former alleged a violation of a veterans' preference statute, so both appeals could progress simultaneously. Nonetheless, the Board recognized that the outcome of one appeal could affect the other, and it joined the appeals before remanding them for adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board implied that the reprisal against an employee who exercises USERRA appeal rights may be actionable under USERRA, but left the point for development on remand in <span class="Italic">Weed v.
