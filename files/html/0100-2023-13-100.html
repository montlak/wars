<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-99"><span class="space">b.</span> Collective Bargaining Contract</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional significance of a collective bargaining agreement's requirement of light duty was indirectly addressed in <span class="Italic">Baker v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 692-94 (1996) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Baker v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 119, 124 &#x00B6; 9 (1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>), involving a claim to a light duty assignment under the Postal Service negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">Baker</span> suggested that an employee makes out a constructive suspension claim if his agency refuses to place him on light duty that is required under a collective bargaining agreement calling for the Postal Service to "make every attempt" to assign the appellant to light duty. <span class="Italic">Baker</span> placed the burden of proof on the employer to demonstrate an absence of work within the employee's limitations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee who is absent due to a medical condition requests work within his or her medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">See Pledger v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 325 (1991). The appellant requested a light-duty assignment on or about August 16, 1990. Article XIII of the relevant collective bargaining agreement requires agency management to "make every attempt" to assign light-duty work to medically restricted employees....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pledger</span> implies that an agency must show that it informed an employee of work within his medical restrictions if such work existed, but it does not say which party bears the burden of proof on the issue of whether there actually was work available within the employee's medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 50 MSPR at 329-30. We hold that, once an employee who was absent due to a medical condition makes a non-frivolous allegation that he is able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicates his willingness to work, and that the agency does not allow him to return, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show either that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions, or that it offered such work to the employee and he declined it. If the agency meets its burden, the appellant must then present sufficient rebuttal evidence to meet his overall burden of persuasion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]. This allocation of the burden of proof is similar <span id="Page_2097"></span>to that applicable to claims of disability discrimination, where the Board has noted that the agency is in a better position than the employee to know about its ability to modify duties or working conditions and the availability of positions that could be filled by disabled employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Savage v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148, 152 n.2 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the present case, we find that the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that he was able to work within certain restrictions in January of 1991, that he communicated his willingness to work, and that the agency did not allow him to return even though the collective bargaining agreement required it to "make every attempt" to assign the appellant to light duty. Thus, under the framework announced above, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show either that there was no work available within his restrictions, or that it offered work to the appellant and he declined it...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1996 <span class="Italic">Baker</span> decision linked the obligation of a collective bargaining agreement with the Board's jurisdiction over a constructive suspension claim, but <span class="Italic">Baker</span> did not state that jurisdiction depends upon that obligation or whether the absence of the obligation is a defense to a claim that is within the Board's jurisdiction and solely founded on the employer's refusal, for whatever reason, to bring an employee back to work on light duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baker v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 119, 122-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-13 (1999), reaffirmed the implication that nonfrivolous allegations by the employee of the agency's obligation and failure to extend contractual light duty vests jurisdiction in the Board. The jurisdictional basis for the case was stated as: "once an employee who was absent due to a medical condition makes a nonfrivolous allegation that he was able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicated his willingness to work, and that the agency did not allow him to return, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show either that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions or that it offered such work to the employee and he declined it":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges on review that the administrative judge erred in finding that he was not constructively suspended between January 1991 and July 1991. We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency produced evidence showing that there were no permanent light-duty positions available on Tour 3, the tour on which the appellant previously worked, within his restrictions during the above time period. We also agree that the appellant did not present sufficient rebuttal evidence with respect to Tour 3 to meet his overall burden of persuasion. The administrative judge also found, however, that the agency was not required to broaden its search for permanent light-duty positions beyond Tour 3 at the Denver General Mail Facility (GMF). We find that the appellant correctly argues on review that this finding was erroneous, that the agency was required under the collective bargaining agreement to search for permanent light-duty positions on all tours, including Tours I and 2, at the Denver GMF, and that the agency did not present evidence on remand with respect to those tours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Article 13 of the collective bargaining agreement, the agency and the union expressly recognize a responsibility "to aid and assist deserving full-time regular or part-time flexible employees who through illness or injury are unable to perform their regularly assigned duties...." Section 13.2B states that an ill or injured full-time regular or part-time flexible employee with a minimum of 5 years of employment, or any full-time regular or part-time flexible employee who sustains an injury on duty, may "submit a voluntary request for permanent assignment to light duty or other assignment to the installation head if the employee is permanently unable to perform all or part of the assigned duties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the face of such a request, the installation head must "show the greatest consideration for full-time regular or part-time flexible employees requiring light duty or other assignments, giving each request careful attention, and reassign such employees to the extent possible <span class="Italic">in the employee's office." Id.</span> (emphasis added). In addition, under section 13.4A, "[e]very effort shall be made to reassign the concerned employee <span class="Italic">within the employee's present craft or occupational group,</span> even if such assignment reduces the number of hours of work for the supplemental work force." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Similarly, under the local memorandum of understanding, management will "make every attempt" to assign employees who request light duty or reassignment. Such requests may not always be granted, for the agreement provides that when a request is refused, the installation head shall notify the employee in writing of the reasons for the inability to reassign. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the above provisions required that the search for permanent light-duty positions encompass Tours I and 2, as well as Tour 3. The collective bargaining agreement refers in broad terms to reassignments within the employee's "office," "craft," and "occupational group," and does not restrict reassignments to the employee's previous tour. In fact, the agency's representative asserted on remand that the agency in 1990 looked for a light-duty position for the appellant on Tour 2....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board held previously in this case, <span id="Page_2098"></span>if an employee who is absent due to a medical condition requests work within his medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">See Baker,</span> 71 MSPR at 692. Once an employee who was absent due to a medical condition makes a nonfrivolous allegation that he was able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicated his willingness to work, and that the agency did not allow him to return, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show either that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions or that it offered such work to the employee and he declined it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 693. <span class="Italic">See Peartree v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 66 MSPR 332, 339 (1995); <span class="Italic">Cf. Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 MSPR 46, 51 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We found in <span class="Italic">Baker</span> that, in January of 1991, the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicated his willingness to return to work, and that the agency did not allow him to return even though the collective bargaining agreement required it to "make every attempt" to assign him to light duty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This shifted the burden of production to the agency. We now find that the agency did not meet its burden because it did not show either that there was no work available within the appellant's restrictions or that it offered the appellant work that he declined. In this regard, the agency did not show that there was no work available within the appellant's restrictions on Tours I and 2. Thus, the appellant has established that he was constructively suspended when the agency did not offer him work within a reasonable time of his request to return to work. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 78 MSPR 159, 163 (1998); <span class="Italic">cf. Sargent v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 55 MSPR 387, 395-96 (1992) (where the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, and the agency did not meet its burden of production by showing that it could not reasonably and safely accommodate the disability, the agency's adverse action was an act of discrimination). Because the agency effected the constructive suspension without affording the appellant the required statutory procedural protections of prior notice, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond, it must be reversed. <span class="Italic">Walker v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 58 MSPR 614, 617-18 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must, however, determine the length of the appellant's suspension. First, we find that the appellant made his request for light duty on or about January 17, 1991....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also disputed is how long the agency had to "make every attempt" to accommodate the appellant. Article XIII, paragraph A of the local memorandum of understanding provides that "[u]pon receipt of each request for light duty or assign the employee, management will make every attempt to assign the employee and if unable to assign within 72 hours after the employee's request, then the installation head or his designee will meet with the craft representative to determine if assignment is available." Two agency witnesses testified that it was their understanding that the seventy-two hour requirement applied only to requests for temporary light duty, not permanent light duty.... We have found nothing in the written record showing a separate time limit for permanent light-duty requests. Thus, we find that the agency was required to make every effort to assign the appellant within seventy-two hours of receipt of his request. There is no indication that the agency did so. Accordingly, we find that the agency improperly constructively suspended the appellant from January 20, 1991, through July 31, 1991, and REVERSE the initial decision on this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McIver-Smith v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 464, 467 (1997), summarized <span class="Italic">Baker</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) &#x0026; 7513(d). Two distinct situations can give rise to constructive suspension claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first situation occurs when an agency places an employee on forced leave pending an inquiry into his or her ability to perform<span class="Italic">. See Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In such a case, "the dispositive question is whether the appellant or the agency initiated the absence." <span class="Italic">Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 MSPR 121, 127-28 (1994) (citations omitted). If the agency initiated the absence, then the employee was constructively suspended. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the present case, the appellant voluntarily absented herself from work from January 17 through April 7, 1996. For this period, then, her absence was not a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second situation that can give rise to a constructive suspension claim occurs when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. Our decision in <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 MSPR 680 (1996), issued just six days before the initial decision herein, sets out the framework for analyzing a constructive suspension claim based on this scenario. Clarifying the earlier precedent of <span class="Italic">Pledger v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 MSPR 325 (1991), the Board held in <span class="Italic">Baker</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an employee who is absent due to a medical condition requests work within his or her medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">71 MSPR at 692. Noting that <span class="Italic">Pledger</span> did not say which party bears the burden of proof on the availability-of-work issue, the Board further held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]nce an employee who was absent due to a medical condition makes a non-frivolous allegation that he [wa]s able to work within certain restrictions, that he communicate[d] his willingness to work, and that the agency [did] not allow him to return, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show either that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions, or that it offered such work to the employee and he declined it.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Baker</span> requirements concerning a return to light-duty could be applicable when an employee is absent from the workplace for one condition, that condition is brought under control, but another condition necessitates an adjustment in work requirements if the employee seeks to return to work with light duty that is required by contract or regulation, <span class="Italic">Hardy v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 539, 544-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We address the agency's claim, also raised below, that the administrative judge erred in failing to analyze the appellant's claim under the standard articulated in <span class="Italic">Baker,</span> and, had she done so, she would not have found Board jurisdiction over the appeal since the agency was not bound by policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to the appellant. In response, the appellant argues that, because the medical condition for which she absented herself from duty on May 23, 2001, i.e., depression, was different from the condition for which she requested permanent light duty on June 5, 2001, i.e., osteopenia, the agency's argument is "misplaced." The appellant also argues that the agency had a policy of granting light duty to non-bargaining unit employees. In support of that contention, the appellant cites to a July 20, 2001 memorandum from the agency to a male supervisor of distribution operations which appears to grant the male supervisor temporary light duty. Notably, this is the same evidence the appellant relied upon below in support of her sex discrimination claim, and again on cross petition for review challenging the administrative judge's determinations with respect to that claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that <span class="Italic">Baker</span> was inapplicable for the very reason now relied upon by the appellant. Specifically, the administrative judge stated: "This is not a case like <span class="Italic">Baker</span>..., where the appellant was not seeking to return to his position, and where the appellant requested to come back to work after voluntarily absenting himself due to the medical condition for which he was seeking accommodation." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant voluntarily absented herself from work for medical reasons involving her depression on May 23, 2001. Her physician treating her depression cleared her to return to work on June 18, 2001. During her absence, as noted above, the appellant requested permanent light duty on June 5, 2001, as a result of her osteopenia. Additionally, during that time, the agency received two certifications from the appellant's treating physicians indicating that she would need "to take time off from work...intermittently or to work on a less than full schedule as a result of" her osteopenia and depression. The appellant alleged that her absence turned involuntary when the agency denied her return to duty scheduled for June 20, 2001, pending a hearing by the committee on her claim for permanent light duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A similar situation was presented in <span class="Italic">Schultz,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. at 161-63. There, the appellant voluntarily absented himself from duty to seek treatment in a mental health hospital. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. One year later, the appellant asked to return to work with certain restrictions related to his synovitis (an inflammatory disease) in his fingers, tendonitis in his wrists, and Reynaud's syndrome (loss of blood supply to nerves in his fingers). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency denied that request and removed the appellant for failure to meet attendance requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board held that the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> principle applied by analogy despite the fact that the appellant had initially absented himself for mental health reasons, but requested to return to duty with certain restrictions related to his hands<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 163. The Board concluded that the agency was bound by statute--specifically, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791--to accommodate the appellant's hand condition and return him to duty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the agency constructively suspended the appellant as of the date it denied his request for accommodation, and, instead, removed him. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the appellant in <span class="Italic">Schultz,</span> it is clear that the appellant was absent from work for medical reasons and asked to return to her position with altered duties, which the agency denied. Thus, her claim should have been analyzed under the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> standard. <span class="Italic">See Baker</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 692; <span class="Italic">see also McNamee-Marrero v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 487 &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (the Board remanded the appeal for a determination under <span class="Italic">Baker</span> of whether the appellant was constructively suspended when the agency failed to accommodate her nonoccupational injury). Specifically, the administrative judge should have determined whether the agency was bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to the appellant, and, if so, whether the agency failed to offer the appellant light-duty work. <span class="Italic">See Baker,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 692. The administrative judge erred by not affording the appellant notice of the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> standard for evaluating her constructive suspension claim....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thibodeaux v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 76 MSPR 178, 181 (1997), affirmed the significance of a provision of a labor agreement calling for light duty assignments. In <span class="Italic">Thibodeaux</span> the Board required a jurisdictional hearing on the basis of an allegation that a contract required placement of the appellant on light duty after her physician authorized her return to duty, with restrictions, following a period of absence. The jurisdictional determinant, implied in <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, involved the employee whose medical condition precluded return to medical duty but who requested and was refused work with medical restrictions in an agency whose policies, regulations, or contract required the agency to offer available light duty work to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2099"></span>...An agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave for more than 14 days, based on an alleged physical or mental disability, constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. For purposes of jurisdiction, the key question is whether the agency or the appellant initiated the leave. <span class="Italic">See Lohf v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 MSPR 81, 84 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that the following circumstances constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated the absence and that the enforced absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board: (1) The employee is absent because of a medical condition; (2) she requests work within her medical restrictions; (3) the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee; and (4) the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">See Dize v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 MSPR 635, 639-40 (1997); <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 692 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement which applies to the appellant, the agency agreed to the following term:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen an eligible employee cannot perform in his/her current position due to temporary physical disability and is recommended for light duty by his/her personal physician, corroborated by a competent base physician, [the agency] will exert reasonable effort to assign the employee to light duty commensurate with mission requirements and subject to availability of appropriate work within the employee's capability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this evidence constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency was obliged to look for work within the appellant's medical restrictions and thus a nonfrivolous allegation that, under <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, the Board has jurisdiction over the action as a constructive suspension of more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">Dize</span>, 73 MSPR at 639-40.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant provided evidence below that: She was in a leave without pay status from September 5, 1994, to February 20, 1997, due to soreness in her feet; she requested light duty on several occasions between November 14, 1994, and July 22, 1996; the Employee and Labor Relations Manual made provisions for temporary reassignments to light-duty positions and other employees were provided such positions; and the agency denied her request for light-duty work. Having set forth such evidence, the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated her absence from work after November 14, 1994, and that as a result, she was placed on enforced leave for a period of more than 14 days, i.e., from November 14, 1994, through February 20, 1997, when she returned to work. <span class="Italic">See Dize v. Department of the Army,</span> 73 MSPR 635, 639-40 (1997). The appellant thus raised a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1999, the Federal Circuit decided that if an employee requests light duty, the agency denies the change of status, and the employee then takes sick leave because of medical restrictions imposed by his own physician barring his return to his permanent job, the Board lacks jurisdiction a constructive suspension based on the denial of light duty status if there is no light duty available. <span class="Italic">Ricks v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3020), involving a mailhandler who requested a light duty assignment following an injury in an off-duty accident, noted, without specifying whether there was an obligation by the agency to provide light duty under policy, regulation, or contract (although the Board's initial decision shows that the light duty request was analyzed under a provision of a negotiated agreement):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In each of the cases in which a constructive suspension has been found, the agency had not allowed the employee to work. That is not true in this case. Mr. Ricks has made no showing that the Postal Service did not allow him to work in his position as a mailhandler prior to his enforced leave. The letters on which Mr. Ricks relies merely denied his requests for duty with requirements other than those of his mailhandler position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In pressing his "constructive suspension" argument, Mr. Ricks points to the following language of Ms. Sherrill's March 7, 1997, letter:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Y]our light duty request has been disapproved. This disapproval is based on the fact that there are no positions available, which you could perform within the limitations/restrictions indicated by your physician without increased risk of injury to yourself and others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> an order of enforced leave based on possible physical risk to the employee was found to be a constructive suspension. Ms. Sherrill's letter, however, did not constitute an order of enforced leave based on a risk of injury, but simply defined the types of positions that were investigated in accordance with Mr. Ricks's request. In view of the physician's letter that Mr. Ricks enclosed with his request, Ms. Sherrill reasonably interpreted his request to include only those positions meeting the requirements of the letter, i.e., positions that he could perform within certain limitations without leading to an enhanced risk of injury to himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to formally placing Mr. Ricks on enforced leave status in July 1997 (an action that is not at issue in this appeal), the agency did nothing that barred him from returning to his mailhandler duties, even though Mr. Ricks and his physician did not feel he was capable of performing the duties of that position. While Dr. Whited's letter pointed out the negative consequences of requiring him to resume those duties, Board jurisdiction cannot be based on duty restrictions announced by an employee's personal physician. Because the agency never barred Mr. Ricks from working in the position he occupied, we affirm the Board's dismissal of his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the appellant to establish that his or her medical conditioned necessitated the light duty, i.e., the appellant must demonstrate that the benefit offered by light duty matches the medical restriction precluding the employee from performing in the regularly assigned position. <span class="Italic">McIver-Smith v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 464, 467-471 (1997), examined constructive suspensions and USPS labor relations policies concerning light duty for employees whose physicians certify that they are able to return to work after a period of medical absence and determined that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's allegations because she did not establish that she submitted a medical explanation sufficient to properly invoke the agency's obligation to provide light duty under USPS policies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant claims that the agency constructively suspended her when it denied her request to return to work on April 8, 1996 with the restriction that she work daylight hours only for 12 weeks. Thus, her claim should be analyzed under the <span class="Italic">Pledger/Baker</span> standard. The parties' arguments before the administrative judge were directed toward whether the appellant was constructively suspended under the <span class="Italic">Pittman/Rivas</span> standard, however, and the administrative judge did not consider the applicability of <span class="Italic">Pledger and Baker</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was absent due to a medical condition, that she asked to return to work within certain restrictions, and that the agency did not allow her to return. The threshold issue under <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, then, is whether the agency was "bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision" to offer available work to the appellant within her medical restrictions. In <span class="Italic">Baker</span> the appellant was covered by a contractual provision that obligated the agency to assign bargaining unit employees to work within their medical restrictions when available, whereas the appellant herein, as a supervisor, was not covered by any similar collective bargaining agreement. The agency may have had a policy that covered her, though. Section 353.323 of the agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees recuperating from a serious injury or illness who are unable to perform their regularly assigned duties may (if administratively feasible) be temporarily assigned to such duties as they can perform for a short period of time pending their recovery. Generally, these employees should be required to present acceptable medical evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below that the appellant "is not guaranteed light duty by postal regulations nor is she guaranteed light duty on an assignment other than her normal tour of duty." This argument implies that ELM &#x00A7; 353.323 does not constitute a policy of assigning to an employee recovering from an illness or injury any available work within his or her medical restrictions.... We...assume...solely for purposes of this case, that ELM &#x00A7; 353.323 <span class="Italic">does</span> represent a policy of assigning to an employee recovering from an illness or injury any available work within his or her medical restrictions.... We further assume...that the agency had work available for her during daylight hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ELM &#x00A7; 353.323 permits the agency to deny a request for an assignment within an employee's medical restrictions if the employee does not support the request with "acceptable medical evidence." The agency contended in its brief filed below that "[t]he appellant was asked repeatedly for a medical rational[e] as to why daylight hours were the only hours she could work with her diagnosed condition. The appellant failed to provide such rationale." The appellant was afforded an opportunity to respond to the agency's brief, and in fact she did respond, in detail. Accordingly, we may decide, on this record, the question of whether the appellant submitted acceptable medical evidence justifying a shift change....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after her absence began, the appellant submitted a form CA-1, "Federal Employee's Notice of Traumatic Injury and Claim for Continuation of Pay/Compensation," in which she alleged that the actions of a "new supervisor" had triggered "distress." The appellant's doctor submitted an "Attending Physician's Report" in support of her claim, in which he stated that the appellant had been subjected to "harassment" by a "new supervisor," and that she suffered from "sinus tachycardia secondary to stress/anxiety."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Later, in support of her request to return to work, the appellant submitted a note from her doctor that stated: "This patient may return to work 4-8-96. P[atien]t must work daylight hours...due to ventricular tachycardia [for] 12 weeks." The appellant's doctor also filled out another "Attending Physician's Report," in which he stated that the appellant suffered from "panic attack, anxiety, [and] sinus tachycardia secondary to stress," and that she could return to work on April 8, "day light only." In addition, the appellant's doctor filled out a "Medical Clearance and/or Certification to Return to Work" form, in which he stated that she should work "day-light hours for 12 weeks."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asked the appellant to provide "[t]he medical rationale relating your illness to the time of day you may work." In response, the appellant's doctor stated in a letter: "I have recommended that this patient work the day turn shift as it is less stressful than the other shifts.... Ventricular [t]achycardia could be aggravated or caused by work related stress." The agency responded to this letter by asking the appellant to have her doctor explain: "What stressors on your regular afternoon shift are to be avoided? How will a change in your schedule help control [v]entricular [t]achycardia? Will [your doctor] permit a change to Tour 1 [11:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>-7:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span>]?" The appellant then submitted a May 24, 1996 letter in which her doctor stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is my opinion that this pa[ti]ent would be able to cope much better on day turn for the first twelve weeks of her return to work. The patient needs to avoid her supervisor on her regular afternoon <span id="Page_2100"></span>shift. The ventricular tachycardia is a result of stress. The less stress that this patient is subject to, the less chances are that she will experience ventricular tachycardia. I do not feel that the patient should be changed to Tour 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the appellant's Form CA-1 attributed the onset of her condition to a particular supervisor, not working after dark, and her doctor's key concern, as evidenced in the May 24 letter, was that she not have contact with that supervisor. The appellant never submitted anything from her doctor explaining how working after dark would aggravate her condition. Her doctor's assertion that he did not "feel" she should work Tour 1--thereby avoiding the supervisor who supposedly contributed to her condition--does not explain how her condition necessitated daylight work only. The appellant did not submit any medical evidence before her return to pay status explaining why she could not work after dark.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that ELM &#x00A7; 353.323 represents a policy of assigning to employees with medical restrictions whatever work is available within their restrictions, and further assuming that the agency had work available for the appellant within her stated restriction of daylight work only, the agency did not constructively suspend her when it denied her request to return to work because she did not provide acceptable medical evidence justifying daylight work only, as contemplated by section 353.323....</p>
