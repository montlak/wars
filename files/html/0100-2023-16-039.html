<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-40"><span class="space">a.</span> Existence of Impasse; FMCS, FSIP; Obligations Before and During Impasse</h5>
<p class="noindent">Impasse does not exist only because one party cuts off negotiations. Impasse is a bilateral status reached at the conclusion of negotiations. <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC and AFGE Local 85</span>, 32 FLRA 855, 874 (1988) (ALJ Decision). The assessment of a state of impasse will be made on review of the bargaining history if the parties are in dispute over whether impasse existed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Space Sys. Div. and AFGE Local 2429</span>, 38 FLRA 1485, 1502 (1991) (ALJ Decision). During contract negotiations, an agency or activity may not implement impassed proposals while resolution of those proposals is pending before the FSIP. <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE</span>, 5 FLRA 288, 293 (1981) (ALJ Decision). The agency may not implement changes in negotiable conditions of employment during negotiations before impasse has been reached and the union has had the opportunity to seek FSIP assistance. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 1210</span>, 25 FLRA 32, 37 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 832d Combat Support Group, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 36 FLRA 289, 300 (1990) (ALJ Decision) (two days' time was insufficient). If the agency changes working conditions while the Impasses Panel is attempting to resolve a dispute through mediation-arbitration, FLRA's order may require the agency to comply with the decision reached through arbitration to the extent that the decision is consistent with law, rule, and regulation. <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Arlington and AFGE Council 215</span>, 47 FLRA 1225, 1226 (1993). [Decisions should also be reviewed in <a href="0100-2023-15-001.html#sec7-1">Chapter 7</a> concerning impasses and FSIP operations.]</p>
<p class="noindent">The obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> also applies to the use of FMCS: the parties should maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> while FMCS considers an impasse in bargaining. If, however, there is an impasse, and the union desires to use FMCS assistance, it should ask the employer to delay implementation of a proposed change in working conditions until that assistance can be secured. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Supply Ctr., San Diego and AFGE Local 1399</span>, 31 FLRA 1088, 1092-93 (1988) (suggesting rule applies to any third party mediation efforts). The employer should accommodate a reasonable request for delay in the implementation of a change that leads to impassed impact bargaining. It is unreasonable for the agency to deny a union request to postpone a reorganization to permit negotiations as to the reasonably foreseeable impact of the reorganization. <span class="Italic">GPO and Joint Council of Unions</span>, 13 FLRA 203, 204 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before an agency is required to avoid implementation of a change following and during an impasse, assistance to resolve the impasse must be properly requested. FLRA provided some definition to the manner of the request for assistance in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 534-35, 545-47 (1988) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 v. FLRA</span>, 893 F.2d 380 (D.C. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">post</span>), involving negotiation over a change in a tour of duty for an employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 1, the parties met and bargained but did not reach agreement. The parties acknowledged that they were at impasse and the meeting ended. On December 23, the Respondent gave the Union written notice that it would implement the change on January 10, 1982, to allow Porter "time to make whatever personal adjustments he considers necessary."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union responded on December 23, stating that "[w]e have no choice but to notify the FSIP...and the FMCS...that we desire to have their services in this matter."...&#8197;Also, on December 23, the Union requested the Respondent to "maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> and help us enlist the help of the <span id="Page_1266"></span>FMCS as soon as possible."...&#8197;On the same day, the Union wrote a letter to FMCS stating that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The undersigned union representative has been negotiating with management...over the duty hours of a bargaining unit employee. We are now at impasse and request that you provide your services as soon as possible to help resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The letter noted that copies were also being sent to the Respondent and to the Panel.&#x2003;The Judge found that a return receipt indicated that FMCS received correspondence from the Union on December 28, 1981.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, on December 23 the Union sent the following letter to the Panel, with copies to the Respondent and to FMCS:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The undersigned union representative has been engaged in negotiations with management...over the duty hours of one Mr. Robert Porter. I requested the aid of the FMCS in this matter and am notifying you of the situation and the union's desire for management to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during the impasse procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The letter was sent by regular mail.&#x2003;No evidence of receipt by the Panel was provided at the hearing before the Judge....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent implemented the change on January 10, 1982. Neither the Union nor the Respondent had any further communication with FMCS or the Panel on this matter either before or after the Respondent implemented the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span>, 18 FLRA 466, 469 (1985), the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[O]nce parties have reached an impasse in their negotiations and one party timely invokes the services of the Panel, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible, i.e., to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, in order to allow the Panel to take whatever action is deemed appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained after parties have reached impasse depends on varying factors and involves the evaluation of the facts in each case. <span class="Italic">Order Denying Request for General Ruling</span>, 31 FLRA 1294. As relevant to this case, we must determine: (1) whether the Respondent provided the Union with a reasonable opportunity to request the services of the Panel; (2) whether the Union properly invoked the services of the Panel; and (3) whether the Union's letter to FMCS obligated the Respondent to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Respondent's notification to the Union on December 23, 1981, that the change would be effective on January 10, 1982, gave the Union sufficient time in which to invoke the services of the Panel prior to the implementation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's letter of December 23, 1981, to the Panel did not request Panel assistance to resolve the impasse; it merely provided the Panel with a status report of the situation. Moreover, the letter was not accompanied by specific information, such as a statement of the issues at impasse and related information on the parties' negotiations, required by the Panel's Rules and Regulations, and there is no showing that this evidence was thereafter furnished to the Panel. Further, there is no evidence in the record that the Union attempted any further communication with the Panel. As the Judge stated, there is no explanation as to "why, if the Union was genuinely seeking FSIP and FMCS intervention in this matter, it did not communicate with those agencies after the initial letters of December 23 were sent."...&#8197;Moreover, as the Judge found, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Panel was aware that its services were being sought. In these circumstances, we agree with the Judge that the Union did not invoke the services of the Panel so as to preclude the Respondent from implementing the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and the Union contend that even if the Union did not properly invoke the services of the Panel, the Union's letter to FMCS was sufficient to require the Respondent to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent advised the Union on December 23, 1981, that it intended to implement the change in Porter's hours on January 10, 1982. The Union's December 23, 1981, letter to FMCS requested its services to help resolve an impasse over a unit employee's duty hours. Although the letter requested FMCS assistance "as soon as possible," it did not inform FMCS that the Respondent intended to implement the change in the duty hours on January 10, 1982. FMCS apparently received the Union's letter on December 28, 1981, but there is no showing in this record that FMCS contacted either party at any time before or after implementation of the change to acknowledge that the matter was before it or to arrange any mediation assistance. Moreover...there is no evidence of any attempt by the Union to follow up on its letter to FMCS by inquiring as to whether FMCS would provide assistance to resolve the impasse. The Union had sufficient time to make such an inquiry before the planned implementation of the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we decline to hold that the mailing of a letter to FMCS, without any further action by the Union and without any mediation assistance provided by FMCS, is sufficient to preclude the Respondent from implementing a change designed to correct an existing safety hazard and to increase the effectiveness of the Respondent's operation. Consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Order Denying Request for General Ruling</span>, 31 FLRA 1294, our decision in this case is based on our evaluation of the particular facts in the record before us. Since the issue is not presented in this case, we do not decide whether an agency commits an unfair labor practice if it implements a change as to a matter at impasse at a time when FMCS is working with the parties in an attempt to resolve the impasse.</p>
<p class="noindent">On review the <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23</span> result was affirmed, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 v. FLRA</span>, 893 F.2d 380, 382-83 (D.C. Cir. 1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Had the union properly invoked the services of the Impasses Panel, any Air Force failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> (to the extent consistent with its functions) would have been, under the Authority's rulings, an unfair labor practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (6)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">status quo</span> depends, however, on some party's having properly invoked the services of the Impasses Panel. This requires filing a fairly simple request form, on which the applicant is to state such basic information about the dispute as the identity of the parties, the issues at impasse, the positions of the parties, and an account of negotiation and mediation sessions held. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2471.1-5 (1988). The union did not comply with these requirements....&#8197;It failed to provide either the required form or its substantive content, and its single brief letter to the Impasses Panel did not even request its services. Nor did the union follow the letter up even after the Air Force sent a reminder that it planned to change Porter's hours on January 10, 1982. We have no hesitation in affirming the Authority's conclusion that the union did not adequately invoke the services of the Panel, especially in light of the deference we owe the Authority's orders in these cases....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Had the Air Force unduly jumped the gun, by ordering the change before the union had a reasonable opportunity to seek the aid of the Impasses Panel, the Authority would have excused its noncompliance with the request procedures. It found, however, that the 18-day period between December 23, 1981, and January 10, 1982, provided a reasonable opportunity....&#8197;Its decision here is both reasonable and perfectly consistent with its previous ones on the subject....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also rejected the union's argument that its letter to the Mediation Service triggered a duty on the part of the Air Force to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. It left open whether the duty might arise once the Mediation Service started "working" to resolve an impasse, 33 FLRA at 547, but found that in any event the letter was not enough. Although the union letter to the Mediation Service requested its help "as soon as possible,"...it did not inform the Service of the January 10 deadline or provide any details of the dispute. Also, the union sent no follow-up letter, despite the Air Force's reminder. The Mediation Service never contacted either of the parties involved. The Authority found no duty to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> under these circumstances, and petitioner offers no reason why we should interfere with that judgment.<span class="Italic"> See Order Denying Request for General Ruling</span>, 31 FLRA 1294, 1297 (1988) (whether <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained once parties have bargained to impasse depends on "many factors and the evaluation of the facts in each case").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the union's assertion that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119 makes invocation of the help of the Mediation Service a prerequisite to seeking the aid of the Impasses Panel. Nothing in the language of &#x00A7; 7119 appears to impose such a requirement, and the union reveals no other source. Accordingly we do not pass on how the existence of such a requirement might affect the Authority's ruling.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the employer may be charged with failing to cooperate in impasse procedures, it must be aware that those procedures were invoked. The employer does not commit a ULP if it changes working conditions during impasse procedures unknown to it because the union did not serve the employer with a copy of its request to FSIP for assistance and FSIP did not serve the employer with correspondence before the employer changed working conditions. <span class="Italic">EEOC and Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216, AFGE</span>, 48 FLRA 306, 311 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the union properly submitted disputed matters to the Panel, the agency must maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> to the maximum extent possible, that is, to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, to allow the Panel to take whatever action it deems appropriate. <span class="Italic">DHHS, HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 39 FLRA 120, 131 (1991). The effect on the duty to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> while the Panel is considering (and later rejects as beyond its jurisdiction) a matter presented for resolution, was addressed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB <span id="Page_1267"></span>and NAGE Local R7-23, SEIU</span>, 42 FLRA 266, 273 (1991) (ALJ Decision), adding as to other rationales advanced to justify the unilateral changes made by the agency in EDP pay practices:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found no basis on which to conclude that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> requirement is, or should be, affected by whatever action the Panel eventually takes regarding the impasse. The purpose of the requirement is to facilitate the Panel's consideration of negotiation impasses and allow the Panel to take whatever action it deems appropriate to resolve disputes. Allowing an agency to implement a change based on its speculation as to what action the Panel will take after implementation would undermine the important role played by the Panel in collective bargaining under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Authority has rejected a respondent's contention that it was not obligated to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> because the Panel declined jurisdiction after implementation....&#8197;The Authority has also rejected a respondent's arguments that implementation was required by agency deadlines....&#8197;Similarly, while the Authority agreed with an agency that costs are a legitimate factor in deciding what is necessary for the efficient functioning of an agency, the Authority rejected an agency's argument that costs alone required implementation while an impasse was pending before the Panel....</p>
