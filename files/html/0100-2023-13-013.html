<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-14"><span class="space">1.</span> Jurisdictional Showing</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board ties the merits with jurisdiction in an untidy bundle. If an action taken against the employee would be subject to adverse action appeal rights, an action taken by the employee involuntarily is also appealable. First it must be shown, however, that the action is involuntary. If the action is voluntary, the Board lacks jurisdiction and will dismiss the appeal. With or without a hearing, if a constructive suspension appeal is beyond the Board's jurisdiction, the Board lacks authority to adjudicate discrimination claims associated with the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McMillian v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 334, 335 &#x00B6; 5 (2005). Parenthetically, it must also be established that the constructive adverse action, e.g., resignation, was actually an effected personnel action. If, by reason of peculiarities of an agency's labor relations program, an individual may resign on a date after the effective date of an adverse action termination, the resignation appeal is mooted by the removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 369, 371 (1995). The appellant who appeals a constructive adverse action must qualify as a statutorily-defined employee for the Board to consider whether the action was constructively adverse. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0752-15-0715-I-1 (NP 6/16/2016) ("Only an employee with appeal rights to the Board under chapter 75, however, can appeal an involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mfotchou v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 317, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). Here, in response to one of the administrative judge's jurisdictional orders, the agency submitted unrebutted documentary evidence that the appellant was appointed to a competitive-service position in November 2012 and that she resigned from that position before completing her 1-year probationary period. Accordingly, because the appellant is not an employee with appeal rights under chapter 75, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's allegation that her resignation from employment in 2012 was involuntary."). <span class="Italic">cf. Oram v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210505140">855 Fed. Appx. 687</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP) (in somewhat unclear facts, there was no adverse action jurisdiction as to claimed forced resignation of an individual who was a probationer with the Army and who had never entered duty with another agency, Census Bureau, before he withdrew his application for consideration for the Census position that he had been offered but that he had not yet commenced; he apparently referenced a "resignation" that was apparently construed to operate as to his probationary <span id="Page_1897"></span>job with the Army). [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-117.html#sec2-115">Mootness of Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With a constructive adverse action appeal, the Board looks for nonfrivolous allegations that would, if proved, support jurisdiction. If there is a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the appeal goes to a hearing (or is determined on the record if no hearing is requested), and at the conclusion of the factfinding process, jurisdiction is determined along with the merits of the case, <span class="Italic">Mojarro v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 335, 341 &#x00B6; 11, 2010 MSPB 42 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In constructive adverse action appeals, nonfrivolous allegations do not establish jurisdiction; rather, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the action was involuntary to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Heath v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). If an appellant raises a nonfrivolous allegation that he was constructively suspended for more than fourteen days, then he is entitled to a hearing, if requested, at which he must prove jurisdiction over his appeal by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Sage,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 398 &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Dones v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 10 (2007).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that jurisdiction attached to his appeal when he made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. A nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction is an allegation of fact that, if proven, could establish a prima facie case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="italic">Aldridge v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 10 (2008). The appellant relies on <span class="italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992), in support of his argument. However, Spruill was not a case involving an allegedly involuntary adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 but an individual right of action (IRA) appeal brought under the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="italic">See Hessami v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 979 F.3d 1362, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (applying Spruill to clarify the nonfrivolous allegation standard for establishing Board jurisdiction in whistleblower appeals). Some later decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit applied Spruill's nonfrivolous allegation standard in non-IRA cases. However, the Federal Circuit's en banc decision in <span class="italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (en banc), made it clear that Spruill does not apply in chapter 75 cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To summarize, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7512, once a claimant makes non-frivolous claims of Board jurisdiction, namely claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction, then the claimant has a right to a hearing. At the hearing, the claimant must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Board determines that the claimant fails to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, then the Board does not have jurisdiction and the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1344. The Board later explicitly adopted this rule when it found "[i]n constructive adverse action appeals, nonfrivolous allegations do not establish jurisdiction; rather, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the action was involuntary to establish Board jurisdiction." <span class="italic">Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 8 (2014) (<span class="italic">citing Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1325). Therefore, we conclude that the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant was required to prove jurisdiction over his appeal by preponderant evidence and that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The initial determination of whether the case proceeds to a hearing, where the appellant attempts to prove both jurisdiction and the merits of the constructive adverse action claim, is based on the appellant's documentation, allegations, and evidence. The AJ is not to weigh at the preliminary stage--the point where the AJ decides whether the case should go to a hearing, if a hearing is requested--documentation from the agency that contradicts what the appellant has provided. Under <span class="Italic">Mojarro, supra,</span> a constructive suspension appeal, 113 MSPR at 343-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over his alleged constructive suspension appeal, the appellant, who was absent from duty from June 2007-December 2008 as a result of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder, must nonfrivolously allege that he: was able to work within certain restrictions; he communicated to the agency his willingness to work; and the agency prevented him from returning to work. <span class="Italic">See Tardio,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 24. The appellant asserted below that, on or about December 8, 2008, he requested to return to duty, but the agency has not allowed him to return to work and it has not disclosed its reason for disallowing his return. In support of his assertion, the appellant submitted copies of three letters from Harry Lewis, M.D., dating December 24, 2008, through January 15, 2009, and stating, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> that: he had released the appellant as of December 24, 2008, to return to work without restrictions; the appellant has been treated for depressive disorder; and his prognosis is "good."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted below that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that he could return to work. In support of its assertion, the agency submitted documentation showing that, on December 9, 2008, the appellant faxed a letter to the Upland Post Office, his duty station, requesting that he be returned to work in a "[s]tress free, [s]afe, [a]nd [h]umane [w]orking [e]nvironment" at the Ontario Post Office, which he followed with a December 30, 2008 letter stating that he is "ready to return to work" within the "known restriction" for his "foot problems." The agency asserted that the appellant's requests regarding his ability to return to work and supporting documentation, including the December 24 and 31, 2008 letters from Dr. Lewis, were inconsistent; additionally, the agency asserted that the appellant's request to return to duty was submitted shortly after he asserted, in a November 13, 2008 affidavit submitted in support of a civil action he brought against the agency, that he "cannot return to work anywhere within the Postal Service" and that he is "permanently disabled...due to an anxiety/depression disorder." The agency also submitted the results of a January 2009 FFD examination it conducted to determine whether the appellant was capable of performing the duties of his position, which revealed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant believes that: he is still disabled and suffers from the same symptoms that necessitated him being absent from work since 2007; after being denied disability retirement, he has no alternative but to go back to work at the agency; and he would not "last over one week" if he went back to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's assertions below constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction because he has asserted facts which, if proven, could establish that he was constructively suspended for more than fourteen days when the agency denied his December 2008 request to return to duty. <span class="Italic">See Tedesco,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 9. Although the agency's documentation appears to contradict the appellant's assertions and medical documentation that he was able to return to duty at all or, at least, with or without restrictions, we may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties in determining whether an appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). Therefore, because the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over his alleged constructive suspension of more than fourteen days, it is necessary to remand the appeal to afford the appellant with an opportunity to prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disfavored are multiple appeals from related events, each characterized as involuntary, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DHHS,</span> DC-0752-16-0845-I-1, n.9 (NP 3/24/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be an appealable adverse action, a separation by resignation or retirement must have been, in effect, a "removal" action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 11. The appellant is not entitled to two Board appeals regarding the same separation from service merely by labelling one as an alleged involuntary "resignation" appeal and the other as an alleged involuntary "retirement" appeal. Her decision to apply for retirement benefits more than 1 month after she already had separated from service is not an independently appealable action and does not affect the dispositive issue of whether her separation pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement was, in effect, an appealable removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7701(j).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The caselaw that follows reiterates and expands on the basic jurisdictional analysis in constructive adverse action appeals. AJs, appellants, counsel become confused because the law is unclear: in other types of appeals, jurisdiction is ordinarily established through pleadings, not through a hearing on jurisdiction where a jurisdictional finding favorable to the appellant (that a constructive adverse occurred) is the same as a merits finding favoring the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To avoid useless litigation, MSPB demands that, before a hearing is granted and formal adjudication on the merits occurs of an action that seems voluntary but that is challenged as involuntary, there must be at least a preliminary showing that the allegation of involuntariness is not frivolous. To avoid dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, the employee must first overcome the doctrine that employee-initiated actions, e.g., resignation or retirement, are presumed voluntary unless the appellant either presents sufficient evidence to establish that the action was obtained through duress or coercion or shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency. <span class="Italic">Danelishen v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 376, 380 (1990). The appellant's burden to establish the right to a hearing is to allege facts that, if proved, could (not would) establish that an action was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Gibeault v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 114 MSPR 664, 667 n.3, 2010 MSPB 195 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant gains the right to a hearing (sometimes called a "jurisdictional hearing") through a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, e.g., a coerced action, rather than through proof of coercion. <span class="Italic">Yaksich v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <span id="Page_1898"></span>71 MSPR 355, 361 (1996). To reach the hearing, the appellant must be a covered employee, that is, the employee must have sufficient tenure, through qualifying service with a covered employer, to have a right to an adverse action hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tankesley v. TVA</span>, 54 MSPR 147, 150 (1992) (TVA employee had no right to appeal an adverse action, including an involuntary resignation). If the employee claims a coerced resignation from a term appointment, and the appointment would have expired of its own accord on the date of the resignation, the Board lacks jurisdiction. The expiration of the term appointment is not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Endermuhle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 89 MSPR 495, 498-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2001).

<p class="Body-Text">A jurisdictional showing is made if the appeal filed by the employee provides specifics sufficient to identify the job and to allege some circumstances suggesting involuntariness. Although the distinction may lie in semantics, to reach a hearing the appellant need not allege facts that, if proved, <span class="Italic">would definitely</span> establish that an action was involuntary; he need only allege facts that, if proved, <span class="Italic">could</span> establish the claim. <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 88 MSPR 169, 173 &#x00B6; 8 (2001).

Assuming the employee gets to a hearing and proves a constructive adverse action, he establishes jurisdiction and wins the appeal, for the action will be void for lack of due process--a winner-take-all approach. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garza v.

<p class="Body-Text">In early 2006, the Federal Circuit attempted to sort out the tangle of conflicting, confusing, overlapping, and divergent decisions from the Board and that court on the question of whether Board jurisdiction in a constructive adverse action attaches based on nonfrivolous allegations of facts and claims or whether jurisdiction attaches only after the hearing on a nonfrivolous claim. The issue that spawned the controversy was whether the Board could decide a discrimination claim associated with the constructive adverse action without proof of the underlying adverse action, more particularly, whether the Board had authority to resolve a discrimination claim without jurisdiction over the constructive adverse action. The court decided that jurisdiction is dependent on ultimate proof of the merits of the constructive adverse action claim, not just on nonfrivolous allegations, however defined, of that claim, and under <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html%0D">437 F.3d 1322</a>, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[U]nder 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7512, once a claimant makes non-frivolous claims of Board jurisdiction, namely claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction, then the claimant has a right to a hearing. At the hearing, the claimant must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Board determines that the claimant fails to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, then the Board does not have jurisdiction and the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, accompanied by a dissent, explained, 437 F.3d at 1330-44:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The existing procedure for establishing jurisdiction in an adverse action can be summarized as a two step process. If a claimant makes non-frivolous allegations, in other words, allegations that, if proven, can establish the Board's jurisdiction, then the claimant is entitled to a hearing. If at the hearing the claimant establishes the Board's jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, then jurisdiction attaches to the case and the Board has the power to decide the merits of the claim. The claimant's burden of proof for establishing jurisdiction is found in the Board's regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56, which states that "[t]he appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, with respect to...[i]ssues of jurisdiction." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recently the jurisdictional procedures outlined above for 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 have been called into question and several of this court's opinions have led to suggestions that the existing procedure should be reevaluated and changed. The different approaches advocated by the parties derive from two conflicting lines of cases. The DHS relies on <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> and its progeny along with the Board's regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56. On the other hand, Ms. Garcia relies on cases like <span class="Italic">Dick</span> and <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> that have taken <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>'s non-frivolous standard from the IRA and imported it into the jurisdictional burdens of constructive adverse actions. Our analysis begins with a discussion of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> and <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, this court addressed the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, focusing specifically on the Board's jurisdiction over facially voluntary resignations especially where issues of involuntariness were mixed with claims of discrimination. Julio Cruz was an Education Services Specialist in the United States Navy (the "Navy"). On January 29, 1988, the Navy sent Cruz a Notice of Proposed Removal that listed specific instances of insubordination and unsatisfactory performance. Shortly thereafter and presumably in reaction to the proposed removal, Cruz submitted a resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz subsequently appealed to the Board alleging that the proposed removal was a reprisal for his previously filed EEOC complaints and that, because of the proposed removal, Cruz was coerced into resigning. The administrative judge found that Cruz had presented non-frivolous allegations and therefore granted him a hearing after which his case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The administrative judge concluded that the resignation was voluntary and that the agency had reasonable grounds to propose the removal. Furthermore, the administrative judge decided that the proposed removal was not the product of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1242.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board reviewed the administrative judge's decision and concluded that Cruz failed to establish that his resignation constituted an appealable action and that the administrative judge did not err in concluding that his resignation was voluntary. But the Board also held that, because of the administrative judge's conclusion on voluntariness, the administrative judge was wrong to have also addressed the discrimination claim because the Board lacked an independent jurisdictional basis for reviewing that claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz appealed the Board's decision to this court. The original panel opinion, thereafter vacated <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, remanded the case to the Board with instructions to decide "the discrimination issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This court then accepted the Navy's suggestion for <span class="Italic">en banc</span> consideration of the following question: "Whether an allegation of title VII discrimination presented by a former employee expands the jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board to decide that discrimination issue where the board had already determined that it lacked jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 because the former employee had resigned voluntarily." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1243.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Addressing that question, this court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span> held that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he Board has only that jurisdiction conferred on it by Congress. The Board's limited jurisdiction as here applicable is set by a statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, which grants the Board jurisdiction to hear and determine challenges to specific adverse actions of agencies, including removals and four other adverse actions not here involved....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If Cruz had withdrawn his resignation...and if the agency procedures thus triggered had resulted in his removal, the Board would have had jurisdiction over any appeal he might have filed from that appealable adverse agency action. In that event 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 would have come into play and required the Board to decide the merits of the removal action and any discrimination issue Cruz might have presented; but &#x00A7; 7702 merely describes what the Board must do when it has jurisdiction; it is not a grant of jurisdiction. Moreover to apply &#x00A7; 7702 to a case in which there is no appealable action is to re-write the statute by deleting its subsection (a)(1)(A) [from &#x00A7; 7702].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1243-44 (citations omitted). In sum, this court concluded that in &#x00A7; 7702, Congress instructs the Board to hear discrimination claims only where the employee or applicant has been "affected by an action" which may be appealed to the Board. Thus, the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court held that even where there are claims of discrimination mixed with an adverse action, the Board's jurisdiction is still solely determined by considering the Board's jurisdiction over the adverse action alone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, the Board's jurisdiction over a constructive removal or demotion claim will not attach until an employee carries his or her burden of establishing that a self-initiated personnel action was coerced or otherwise involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1244. Although this requisite threshold determination often requires consideration and resolution of certain factual claims, the power to make these determinations is the result of the Board simply exercising its "jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Ultimately, the Board "never acquired jurisdiction" because the claimant failed to prove that his resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1248. Furthermore, this court in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> held that a non-frivolous allegation only entitles the employee to a hearing where he or she will have the opportunity to prove the existence of an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction by proving his or her claim of constructive removal/demotion. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1253.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A long line of this court's opinions, consistent with and approvingly citing <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, have elucidated the details of involuntariness determinations. <span class="Italic">See Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341 (citing <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> for the proposition that the Board "possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned or retired if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her retirement or resignation was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal") (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1023-26 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the Board correctly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> <span id="Page_1899"></span>where the appellant's evidence did not show that his retirement was involuntary); <span class="Italic">Starkey v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 198 F.3d 851, 853 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that voluntary actions are not within the Board's jurisdiction, but the Board may take jurisdiction if the employee can show that his retirement or resignation was involuntary); <span class="Italic">Tretchick v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 109 F.3d 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> for the proposition that the Board "lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an employee who has voluntarily resigned," and that "[a]n employee asserting that his or her resignation was involuntary must show that it was the result of duress, coercion, or misinformation provided by the agency," otherwise the Board lacks jurisdiction over the alleged involuntary action); <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1123 (holding that an employee is not entitled to a hearing on the issue of involuntariness unless he "makes a non-frivolous allegation that, if proved, would establish Board jurisdiction"); <span class="Italic">see also Bartels v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 280, 286-87 (2005) (Marshall, concurring) (listing cases since <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> that favorably cite <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> and its procedures for Board jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, language in this court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> has been adopted in a later line of cases to support a wholly different approach for establishing the Board's jurisdiction. To begin, <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> deals with the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 rather than 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. In 1989, Roland Spruill filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging he was the victim of racial discrimination. One year later, the Department of Veterans Affairs "suspended Spruill for three days without pay. It stated that the sanction was for Spruill's abuse of sick leave. Spruill, alleg[ed] that the suspension was in reprisal for his filing of the EEOC complaint...." <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 681. Spruill sought the Board's review of his claim under the Individual Right of Action (the "IRA") provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. He argued before the Board that filing an EEOC complaint constituted protected whistleblowing activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The panel in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> held that the EEOC claim did not constitute protected whistleblowing, and therefore affirmed the Board's dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 689. As later summarized in <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. Small Business Administration</span>,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 empowers the Board to hear a claim for corrective action by an individual who believes that a personnel action was threatened, taken, or not taken because of his whistleblowing. In [<span class="Italic">Spruill</span>], the court held that, when "a non-frivolous claim for relief has been asserted before the Board [in an IRA appeal], and the outcome is determined by whether the facts support that claim, a decision by the Board that they do not is a failure to prove the claim, not a lack of jurisdiction in the Board." The court opined that, in an IRA appeal, the Board should take jurisdiction based on a "well-pleaded complaint." The court recognized that this approach differed from that of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> where the court made clear that a non-frivolous constructive removal claim is not sufficient to establish jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">96 M.S.P.R. 518, 522-23 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Later panel decisions relying on <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> have continued to apply a non-frivolous standard for IRA jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 219 F.3d 1332, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Willis v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The Board has similarly followed these cases. <span class="Italic">See Rusin v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> dealt exclusively with the IRA statute, a few opinions from this court have taken the so-called <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> view regarding Board jurisdiction and applied it to other statutory frameworks, including &#x00A7; 7512 and constructive actions. <span class="Italic">See Dorrall</span>, 301 F.3d at 1380; <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, 290 F.3d at 1362; <span class="Italic">Walley v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 279 F.3d 1010, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Noting this conflict in <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span> the Board observed that "statements from <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span> cannot be reconciled with the unmistakable holding of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, which is that the Board 'never acquire[s] jurisdiction' over the appeal if the appellant fails to prove that he was constructively removed." 96 M.S.P.R. at 525. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, this court addressed the Board's jurisdiction over a voluntary demotion under the IRA. Although <span class="Italic">Dick</span> did deal with an IRA appeal, the issue in <span class="Italic">Dick</span> was whether the claimant had established the threshold jurisdictional fact of whether he had been subjected to a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). Dick alleged that his reprisal personnel action was a constructive demotion under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Instead of relying on the existing standard for establishing jurisdiction over an allegation of a constructive demotion, the court in <span class="Italic">Dick</span> approvingly cited <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> for the proposition that "[t]he Board has jurisdiction over [a constructive demotion appeal] if the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence." <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, 290 F.3d at 1361. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Dick</span> the non-frivolous allegation standard was expanded to cover involuntary demotions under the IRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Walley</span>, this court also cited <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> as supporting the lower non-frivolous standard for jurisdiction. "Based on a long line of this court's decisions, we concluded that the Board can properly reach the merits of a claim because a non-frivolous allegation is sufficient to confer jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Walley</span>, 279 F.3d at 1018. Echoing the distinction made in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, the <span class="Italic">Walley</span> court stated that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]here are issues before the Board that are at one and the same time jurisdictional issues requiring a non-frivolous allegation for Board jurisdiction and merits issues requiring a determination in favor of the employee if relief is to be awarded. As we discuss below, in the present context the question of whether a termination occurred because of a compensable injury is one of those issues. Board jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation of a termination because of a compensable injury, but the employee can succeed on the merits only if after a hearing there is a finding that such a termination occurred. Section 1201.56 of the regulations, placing the burden of proof on the employee with respect to "jurisdictional issues," is plainly not concerned with the first issue of technical jurisdiction (the need for a non-frivolous allegation), but rather with the second issue (concerning the ultimate merits). It places the burden of proof on the employee at a merits hearing with respect to merits issues that are also jurisdictional issues. Thus, although the regulation characterizes the issues with which it is concerned as "jurisdictional" in nature, the regulation is directed, in fact, to the allocation of the burden of proof on the merits. The consequence is that if a merits issue is one that is also "jurisdictional," the burden of proof on that merits issue remains with the employee even though, as a technical matter, the Board's jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1019.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Dick</span> was followed shortly by <span class="Italic">Dorall.</span> James H. Dorall retired from the United States Army Material Command on August 20, 2000. Prior to his retirement, Dorall had been the subject of potential discipline for allegedly deliberately deceiving a supervisor. Dorall's supervisors made it clear that disciplinary action was not imminent and that the supervisors did not intend to coerce Dorall to retire. Nonetheless, Dorall retired and then appealed his retirement to the Board. Thus, the case involved an allegation of a constructive removal and was squarely a removal case under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court affirmed the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because Dorall had not produced sufficient evidence to support a non-frivolous allegation that he was coerced into involuntary retirement. But in so deciding, this court also stated that "[t]he Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence." <span class="Italic">Dorall</span>, 301 F.3d at 1380 (citing <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, 290 F.3d at 1361). <span class="Italic">Dorall</span> deals not only with &#x00A7; 7512, but also with involuntariness. Thus by citing to <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, the opinion in <span class="Italic">Doral</span>l directly introduced the non-frivolous allegation standard that originated with <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> and its analysis of the IRA into the procedural framework of constructive adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the handful of opinions from this court that reference a non-frivolous jurisdictional standard for &#x00A7; 7512 and constructive adverse actions, the Board has recently also advocated adopting the <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> approach regarding jurisdiction for constructive adverse actions. For example, in his concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span>, Board Chairman McPhie stated that "[b]ut for the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, I would follow the Federal Circuit panel decision in [<span class="Italic">Spruill</span>], and find that jurisdiction attaches when the appellant non-frivolously alleges that the appellant's retirement or resignation was involuntary." <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. at 526 (McPhie, concurring). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Bartels v. United States Postal Service</span>, the Board opined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In sum, we believe that the jurisdictional framework set out in the panel decisions in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span>, [and] <span class="Italic">Dick</span>,...is superior to the jurisdictional framework described in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. If we were free to choose, we would adopt the former framework, and would hold that Board jurisdiction attaches when the appellant makes non-frivolous allegations that he was constructively removed. We are not free to choose, however, and instead are constrained to follow the earlier <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> as opposed to the later panel decisions in <span class="Italic">Spruil</span>l, <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span>, [and] <span class="Italic">Dick</span>.... The initial decision in the present case is consistent with <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, and for that reason we affirm it. Still, it would be helpful to all concerned--parties, practitioners, administrative judges, Board members, even panels of the Federal Circuit--for the full court to revisit <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> and to clarify whether it remains the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">98 M.S.P.R. 280, 285 (2005) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Involuntariness is essential for jurisdiction and it must be proven by the claimant. But while jurisdiction is established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, the merits of the case are determined by the agency's compliance with &#x00A7; 7513(a)-(b). In other words, the jurisdictional determination is not identical to the merits determination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rusin v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, <span id="Page_1900"></span>92 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (2002) (noting in the context of the IRA that there is a near complete overlap between the merits and the jurisdictional determinations: "the making of such [non-frivolous] allegations [for IRA claims] establishes the Board's jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claim on the merits. To prevail on the merits, the appellant is then required to prove these elements by preponderant evidence."). Furthermore, in mixed constructive adverse action cases, there are additional differences between the jurisdictional issues and the merits of the discrimination claim. As stated by the administrative judge in this case,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">evidence of discrimination goes to the ultimate question of coercion, i.e., whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency, that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to request a reduction in grade. Once the Board's jurisdiction has been established in a constructive demotion appeal, issues of discrimination and reprisal may be adjudicated under the standards applicable for proof of discrimination and/or retaliation under Title VII as the case is then a mixed case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, slip op. at 3 (citing <span class="Italic">Markon v. Dep't of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996)). Thus, in a mixed constructive adverse action case, jurisdiction is determined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and the legal standards applicable to establishing involuntariness. Discrimination issues may be considered insofar as they illuminate involuntariness. In contrast, the merits of the discrimination claim are determined by the applicable anti-discrimination statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In these cases, undoubtedly, facts relevant to jurisdiction may also be relevant when deciding the merits. We fail to see, however, how this circumstance makes the current approach illogical. As a practical matter, there need not be any duplicative effort. If a fact determined for jurisdiction is later relevant for the merits determination, there is no reason why that previous finding cannot easily be applied to the merits determination. <span class="Italic">See also Markon</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 580 (noting that "if the appellant establishes that she has been constructively discharged, much of the same evidence of discrimination or retaliation relied upon to establish coercion may also be relevant to proof of discrimination and retaliation under Title VII and/or the WPA"). Importantly, as noted, in mixed cases the discrimination claim itself is adjudicated using the elements, burdens, and defenses specific to the underlying discrimination statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we disagree that the present procedure is unfair. The Board contemplates a scenario where non-frivolous allegations allow the Board's jurisdiction to attach and the Board, therefore, is granted the power to decide the underlying discrimination case. The Board feels that "principles of justice" demand that, independent of "considerations of convenience and workload," the Board should be able to address these discrimination claims on the merits. We fail to see how allowing the Board to hear the discrimination claims after a claimant makes non-frivolous jurisdictional claims is the only way to achieve these ends. Indeed, the very case that is being relied upon for the non-frivolous standard expresses similar concerns about expanding the scope of the Board's jurisdiction in the discrimination arena. As this court stated in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">At [the time the CSRA was passed] the issue of discrimination was a known and abhorred evil that had long been of concern to Congress. Years before, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to combat discrimination. That Act set up the EEOC, and established procedures to encourage the disclosure of discriminatory practices. Upon passage of the CSRA, enforcement and related functions regarding discrimination in Federal employment were placed with the EEOC. This executive action "place[d] the Commission at the center of equal employment opportunity enforcement...[giving] coherence and direction to the government's efforts by developing strong uniform enforcement standards to apply throughout the government: standardized data collection procedures, joint training programs, programs to ensure the sharing of enforcement related data among agencies, and methods and priorities for complaint and compliance reviews."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is good reason for Congress to have structured the act in the manner it did.... It acknowledges the EEOC's role as an expert agency in discrimination matters, facilitates EEOC consolidation of important statistical data, and provides an efficient division of decision making labor. In short, it promotes efficiency and economy. Our conclusion today reinforces Congress' efforts to provide the MSPB with a workload that is within its resources and to provide the EEOC with a continuing leadership role in the ongoing battle to eradicate discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">978 F.2d at 691-92 (citations omitted) (quoting Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 43 F.R. 19807, 92 Stat. 378 (message of the President) (reprinted in 42 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 2000e-4, note (West 1981 &#x0026; Supp. 1992))). Similarly, we note that the dissent's concerns that "[t]he majority eliminates the statutorily prescribed role of the EEOC and the district courts in the adjudication of the merits of the discrimination claims in constructive action cases" were considered and laid to rest in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. Where there is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> constructive action, the Board can certainly hear the discrimination claims. On the other hand, as we noted in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, where the Board finds that there was not a constructive action,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an appeal from the Board may not be the only route for presentation of Cruz' reprisal "Title VII" claim, a claim that would appear to fall within the subject matter jurisdiction of fora other than the Board. First, the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over Title VII claims. If Cruz believes he has been the victim of discriminatory acts violative of Title VII, he may file a complaint and obtain a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> trial in the district court under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f)(3). Further, if Cruz filed a complaint with the EEOC and the EEOC dismissed his complaint because he was presenting the same issues to a court, the EEOC may reopen its proceedings on that complaint after the Board has dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Lastly, Cruz may submit his reprisal claim to the Office of Special Counsel which may, if warranted, take full remedial action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1247-48 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we see no reason to overrule <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> correctly articulated that "[t]he Board has not been granted jurisdiction over Title VII claims<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, i.e., over 'pure' or 'naked' Title VII claims unaccompanied by an appealable action over which the Board does have jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1245. Similarly, we see no reason to disturb the analysis in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> that rejected the notion that the Board "may, after learning [that] a fact 'necessary to its principal jurisdiction' is absent, go on to decide issues within its pendent or ancillary jurisdiction."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1249. <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> is consistent with both the Board's regulation and with the overall statutory scheme for adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our reaffirming of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, we also conclude that certain language in <span class="Italic">Dick</span> is at odds with <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. In <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, this court stated that "[t]he Board has jurisdiction over an appeal [alleging a constructive demotion] if the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence." <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, 290 F.3d at 1361. Accordingly, we overrule <span class="Italic">Dick</span> and <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> to the extent that they are inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To summarize, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 and 7512, once a claimant makes non-frivolous claims of Board jurisdiction, namely claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction, then the claimant has a right to a hearing. At the hearing, the claimant must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Board determines that the claimant fails to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, then the Board does not have jurisdiction and the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Central to the analysis of <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> was <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1244-46 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (Judges Skelton and Newman dissenting). Mr. Cruz resigned after receiving and replying to a removal proposal based on charges of insubordination and unsatisfactory performance. On appeal, an AJ determined that the Navy had reasonable grounds for proposing removal and that Cruz failed to establish that the removal was in reprisal for his EEO complaints. The Board affirmed the AJ, while concluding that the AJ should not have decided the reprisal claim for lack of jurisdiction over the allegedly forced resignation. The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from an employee who has voluntarily resigned. The courts, however, have recognized a corollary proposition, i.e., that the Board does have jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal by an employee whose resignation was not voluntary, an involuntary resignation being deemed a "constructive removal." The Board has jurisdiction to determine whether a resignation was voluntary or involuntary because it has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction, as do its AJ's. A resignation is either voluntary or involuntary on the date it is submitted and jurisdiction must be determined as of that date. Cruz, who has the burden of establishing jurisdiction, alleged before the Board that his resignation was involuntary because the agency knew that the charges it cited as the basis for proposing his removal could not be substantiated. That allegation was correctly found to be without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the absence of sustainable charges and substantive documentation, and in the presence of so many procedural violations, it can only be concluded that there was another reason for the agency's actions; and that reason is my prior EEO involvement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The opposite of Cruz' scenario is present here, where there was strong evidence that the charges constituted good cause, there was substantive documentation, and his resignation precluded all procedures on the proposal. We repeat that the only agency action here was the notification of intent to remove in view of serious charges. The AJ found and the Board affirmed the finding that the Navy fully believed the charges <span id="Page_1901"></span>would be sustained. Under such objective circumstances the Navy would have been remiss if it had condoned Cruz' conduct by failing to bring the charges it brought. In cases properly before this court, i.e., those not involving discrimination, the Board's jurisdiction over an allegedly involuntary resignation has been determined by an evaluation of objective facts without exploration of the subjective motivation of either the employee or the agency. Indeed, this court's evenhanded approach has been to ignore assertions of allegedly evil agency motives in finding resignations voluntary, and to ignore allegedly proper motives in finding resignations involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587; <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). To look to motive in this case would thus be contrary to clear precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must be remembered that the asserted act of reprisal here is the Navy's bringing of the charges. The sole issue here is the Board's jurisdiction, and that issue resolves into whether Cruz' resignation was voluntary or involuntary because obtained by coercion, deception or the like. All evidence of involuntariness must be considered, but the reprisal assertion, if the Board had independent jurisdiction over it, would be subsumed by the findings of no coercion, or deception, or other improper agency act. Though we obviously do not here decide whether reprisal may or may not have been among the motives of Cruz' supervisors, we cannot hold that the bringing of numerous, valid, serious and sustainable charges of conduct that destroys the efficiency of the service constitutes coercion to resign. To so hold would be contrary to precedent and to common sense. This court has repeatedly held that the imminence of a less desirable alternative does not render involuntary the choice made. <span class="Italic">Sammt v. United States</span>, 780 F.2d 31, 32 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Department of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed.

United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 587-88, 207 Ct. Cl. 333 (1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz' primary assertion in his appeal here is that the Board should have decided his reprisal claim and notified him of a right to appeal that decision to the EEOC or a district court because the agency's January 29, 1988 letter was in reprisal for filing his 1987 EEOC complaint. But that mere assertion does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction in this voluntary resignation case. First, a petitioner's mere assertion cannot create jurisdiction. Second, as above indicated, bringing charges, for whatever reason, is not in itself an agency action appealable to the Board. Nor are discriminatory acts in themselves agency actions appealable to the Board. A statute, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2302(b), makes reprisal a prohibited personnel practice, but that statute is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor would a source of jurisdiction be created by accepting, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, Cruz' label for his reprisal assertion: "Title VII claim of discrimination." The Board has not been granted jurisdiction over Title VII claims <span class="Italic">per se</span>, i.e., over "pure" or "naked" Title VII claims unaccompanied by an appealable action over which the Board does have jurisdiction. Cruz on this appeal attempts to convert his attempted appeal under Title 5, U.S.C. to a suit for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. As above indicated, when discrimination is asserted in an appeal from a removal or other appealable adverse agency action over which the Board has jurisdiction, the case is a "mixed case" and the Board must decide the merits of the appealable action and whether it was a discriminatory act. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7702. In such cases, the Board routinely notifies appellants of a right to EEOC review. Where, as here, it has been found that there never was an appealable adverse agency action, the case is not a "mixed case," Sec. 7702 is not involved, and the Board correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider Cruz' claim of procedural error or his reprisal assertion, or any other claim beyond the Board's jurisdiction. That holding and our affirmance break no new ground. <span class="Italic">See Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 742 F.2d 1424 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (jurisdiction lacking over reassignment, no jurisdiction to consider allegation reassignment was in reprisal for exercise of First Amendment rights); <span class="Italic">Synan v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (rejecting reliance on Sec. 7702 because suspension was not an appealable action and refusing to transfer discrimination claims to district court where Board lacked jurisdiction over suspension of 14 days or less: "Reliance on Sec. 7702(a)(1) is of no help to petitioner either, because the discrimination-based action must be one that is appealable."); <span class="Italic">Sammt v. United States</span>, 780 F.2d 31 (Fed. Cir. 1985); and <span class="Italic">Wren, supra</span>. For the same reason, the Board correctly declined to refer to any right of EEOC review and Cruz' motion for transfer of this case to a district court must be denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit was somewhat tentative as to the disposition of the assertion that the action against Cruz--the proposal and resultant resignation--resulted from reprisal for EEO activities, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1247-48:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz implies in his briefs that the Board's refusal to decide his reprisal claim and notify him of a right to appeal to the EEOC or the district court deprived him of all chance for review of what he calls his "Title VII discrimination claim." We need not and therefore do not decide that question. We note, however, that an appeal from the Board may not be the only route for presentation of Cruz' reprisal "Title VII" claim, a claim that would appear to fall within the subject matter jurisdiction of fora other than the Board. First, the district court has subject matter jurisdiction over Title VII claims. If Cruz believes he has been the victim of discriminatory acts violative of Title VII, he may file a complaint and obtain a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> trial in the district court under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(f)(3). <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Roudebush</span>, 425 U.S. 840, 96 S. Ct. 1949, 48 L. Ed.2d 416 (1976). Further, if Cruz filed a complaint with the EEOC and the EEOC dismissed his complaint because he was presenting the same issues to a court, the EEOC may reopen its proceedings on that complaint after the Board has dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Garrett</span>, EEOC App. 01894059 (April 26, 1990). Lastly, Cruz may submit his reprisal claim to the Office of Special Counsel which may, if warranted, take full remedial action. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 1206(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not sit to decide hypotheticals. It may be that a resignation case could arise in which the facts would compel a Board decision on a reprisal assertion. We hold only that in a case like the present, where the Board has determined that a resignation in the face of serious charges was voluntary, it never acquired jurisdiction to decide anything, including the question of whether there may also have been another reason--one outside the Board's statutorily assigned jurisdiction--for proposing those valid charges. <span class="Italic">See Christianson v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jolley v. DHUD,</span> SF-0752-13-0583-I-1 n.5 (NP 6/16/2015) ("Although the appellant argues on review that the agency provided no evidence to support its position that his retirement was voluntary, it is well established that an appellant bears the burden of proof as to issues of jurisdiction, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis is slightly different when no hearing is requested, <span class="Italic">Vitale v. VA</span>, 107 MSPR 501, 509 &#x00B6; 18, 2007 MSPB 300 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant makes nonfrivolous allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish jurisdiction over his constructive removal appeal and he has requested a hearing, then he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Garcia,</span> 437 F.3d at 1344. Where the appellant has not requested a hearing, however, the threshold question is not whether he has raised a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, but whether he has established by <span id="Page_1902"></span>preponderant evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Here, the record establishes that the appellant, who did not request a hearing, was properly apprised of the elements and his burden to establish Board jurisdiction over his alleged involuntary retirement appeal and he responded to the administrative judge's orders to submit evidence and argument on the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Burgess,</span> 758 F.2d at 643-44. Thus, because the existing record is fully developed on the jurisdictional issue, the Board may make a jurisdictional determination based on the written record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions that follow reflect confusion, or lack of clarity, in the law that preceded, and that will likely follow, <span class="Italic">Garcia.</span> Unfortunately, the judges of the Federal Circuit still have not explained what is needed to determine whether there is a nonfrivolous allegation sufficient to take the involuntary adverse action appeal to a jurisdictional hearing. Is the hearing dependent upon allegations alone or allegations supported by evidence at the stage when the appeal is filed or, soon after, when the agency files a motion to dismiss or the AJ issues a show cause order demanding greater specificity in allegations or evidence to support the allegations? Since the Board is the statutorily-empowered agency to resolve civil service disputes by tenured employees, and since adverse actions are squarely within the Board's statutory jurisdiction, the simplest solution is to allow an appeal, along with affirmative defenses (e.g., discrimination claims), to go to hearing based on nonfrivolous allegations. Through the hearing, the AJ sorts out the facts based on the evidence and arrives at a result. If the appellant proves a constructive adverse action, EEO or similar claims are decided; if the appellant loses on the constructive adverse action claim, there is no jurisdiction to decide collateral EEO claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the problem of establishing jurisdiction sufficient to advance a case to hearing, in <span class="Italic">Leggate v. Dept. of Interior,</span> 190 Fed. Appx. 957, 958 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), the Federal Circuit, Judge Dyk dissenting, came close to declaring that an employee's affidavit alone would not support jurisdiction in a constructive adverse action appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to obtain a hearing in front of the board, the petitioner must make "non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence..." showing, in this case, that her resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Dick v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1361-64 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The court in <span class="Italic">Dick</span> specifically found that affidavits of a former government employee <span class="Italic">along with</span> the affidavits of several Department of Veterans Affairs physicians were sufficient to meet the non-frivolous allegation standard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362-63. Because Leggate submitted only her own affidavit, she failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that her resignation was involuntary. As a result, the board did not have jurisdiction, and she was not entitled to a hearing on the merits of her claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006), overruled <span class="Italic">Dick</span> only to the extent that it stood for the assertion that jurisdiction is <span class="Italic">conclusively</span> established by making non-frivolous claims of board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 437 F.3d at 1342-44. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> did not overrule the portion of <span class="Italic">Dick</span> that found affidavits of the former government employee <span class="Italic">along with</span> the affidavits of several DVA physicians to be sufficient to support a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, 290 F.3d at 1362-63.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if in some circumstances an employee's affidavit on its own could be sufficient to support a non-frivolous allegation, the content of Leggate's affidavit was insufficient. The presumption that employee-initiated actions are voluntary has been rebutted in two types of circumstances: (1) when the employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that the agency was planning to take an adverse action against her; and (2) when the employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that the agency made her working conditions intolerable. With regard to Leggate's allegation that the agency was planning adverse action against her, the "letter of instruction" had been withdrawn prior to her resignation. Moreover, to establish involuntariness of one's resignation on such grounds, one must show that the agency lacked reasonable grounds for that adverse action. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Here, Leggate admitted to the behavior on which the letter of reprimand was based. Therefore, her allegation that these letters were proof that the agency planned to take adverse action against her was insufficient to establish the involuntariness of her resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The affidavit was also insufficient to support Leggate's allegation that the supposed hostile work environment was within the control of the agency, that her working conditions were intolerable, and that there was a link between the working conditions and her resignation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1024-25 (setting out the requirements for establishing intolerable working conditions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many Board decisions conflate jurisdiction with merits analysis in constructive adverse action appeals. Complicating the analysis are Board decisions pinning the right to a hearing upon an evidentiary showing sufficient to warrant what the Board occasionally calls a "jurisdictional hearing." The Federal Circuit decisions try to explain to the Board that it obtains jurisdiction from a nonfrivolous set of allegations (with some supporting evidence) of involuntariness. Under the Federal Circuit's analysis, the Board obtains jurisdiction through allegations and it then moves on to a hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">Colbath v. Dept. of Army</span>, 89 Fed. Appx. 727, 730-31 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), likely tempered by the 2006 <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, explained the court's approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army admits that Judge Malouf erred in dismissing Mr. Colbath's claims of involuntary retirement for lack of jurisdiction.[1] Voluntary actions, such as retirement, are not appealable to the MSPB<span class="Italic">. Talley v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 261, 263 (1991). An involuntary retirement, however, is considered equivalent to a removal action and is permitted review by the MSPB<span class="Italic">. Middleton v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (1999). According to our precedent, subject matter jurisdiction vests with the MSPB once the claimant asserts a nonfrivolous claim of forced retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To the extent a successful claim against the government requires compliance with all statutory elements of the claim, failure of proof of an element of the cause of action means the petitioner is not entitled to the relief he seeks. To conclude in such a case that the petitioner loses because the forum is "without jurisdiction" is to obscure the nature of the defect. It would be more accurate to conclude that the petitioner has failed to prove the necessary elements of a cause for which relief could be granted. The forum had jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first instance--that is, subject-matter jurisdiction existed--as long as the petitioner asserted nonfrivolous claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 978 F.2d 679, 678-88 (Fed. Cir. 1992). As explained in <span class="Italic">Spruill,</span> a petitioner establishes jurisdiction with a nonfrivolous allegation; if the petitioner then fails to prove his claim by preponderant evidence, the claim is decided on the merits rather than on jurisdictional grounds. As we have repeatedly stated, a petitioner does not need to <span class="Italic">prove</span> his claim of involuntary retirement to establish subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Dep't Vet. Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on such grounds are improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In light of the Army's concession, we need not determine whether Mr. Colbath's allegations were in fact sufficient. But, as we said in <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 301 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the standard for establishing Board jurisdiction "is analogous to that for summary judgment. Thus in this context, the petitioner must show the existence of a material fact issue as to voluntariness to support Board jurisdiction. Non-frivolous allegations cannot be supported by unsubstantiated speculation in a pleading submitted by petitioner." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1380; <span class="Italic">see also,</span> <span class="Italic">Dick v. Dep't of Vet. Affairs,</span> 290 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our recent precedent has strongly admonished the MSPB to use the <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> standard to determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over a petitioner's claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Navy,</span> 327 F.3d 1354, 1356-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Colbath's present appeal to this Court establishes the importance of complying with the <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge found no jurisdiction on the basis of Mr. Colbath's claim of involuntary retirement, she did not reach his pendent claims of age, race, and gender discrimination. The MSPB does not have jurisdiction over discrimination claims unless it has jurisdiction over the appeal through another claim properly before the Board. <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Once the MSPB has jurisdiction over the appeal, however, the MSPB has a statutory mandate to hear the petitioner's pendent claims of discrimination....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Mr. Colbath made his allegations of forced retirement, he had an appealable action before the Board. By statute, the Board was required to hear both his discrimination claims and the appealable action. Because the MSPB erred in its analysis of its own subject matter jurisdiction, Mr. Colbath was denied an opportunity to press his appeal of the Army's decision regarding his claims of age, race, and sex discrimination. Even more troublesome, because the MSPB itself did not address his discrimination claims, Mr. Colbath was denied judicial review of an adverse decision on those claims in the district courts. 5 U.S.C.S. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another Federal Circuit attempt to have the Board keep clear the distinction between jurisdiction and merits determinations is <span class="Italic">Brooks v. SSA</span>, 97 Fed. Appx. 301, 303 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), its analysis likely limited or revised by <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent evidence to the contrary, a retirement is presumed voluntary and is beyond the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 941 (Fed. Cir. 1984). However, an involuntary retirement is tantamount to a removal, an adverse action over which the Board has jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Staats v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 99 F.3d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1996). In order to overcome the presumption of voluntariness and demonstrate that a retirement was involuntary, an appellant must show either (1) that the retirement was the product of misinformation or deception by the agency, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at <span id="Page_1903"></span>1124 (citing <span class="Italic">Covington,</span> 750 F.2d at 942), or (2) that the retirement was the product of coercion by the agency, <span class="Italic">id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). The test for involuntariness is an objective one; it is not measured by the appellant's subjective evaluation of his or her situation<span class="Italic">. Middleton v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Involuntariness may be established by a showing that an appellant's working conditions were made so intolerable that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to resign<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We held in <span class="Italic">Dick v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span> that "[a]n employee need not prove coercion by preponderant evidence to invoke the Board's jurisdiction and warrant a hearing to determine voluntariness on the merits. Rather, if an employee has made a non-frivolous allegation that, if proven, could establish that his resignation was coerced, that is all that is required to trigger the Board's jurisdiction at this threshold stage." 290 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). "The Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits and other evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1361. "Whether allegations are non-frivolous is determined on the basis of the administrative record." <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Dick,</span> 290 F.3d at 1361). If an appellant makes a non-frivolous allegation that a retirement was involuntary, he or she has a right to a hearing on involuntariness<span class="Italic">. Dick,</span> 290 F.3d at 1362 (citing <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). On the record before us, it appears that Ms. Brooks did not substantiate her allegations with admissible evidence as required by our decision in <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dep't of Army,</span> 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In any event, we find her allegations to be insufficient.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not to be outdone in the welter of inconsistent and confusing pronouncements on jurisdiction in constructive adverse action cases, some on the Board laid blame for the morass on the Federal Circuit in a decision accompanied by an interesting concurrence by Acting Chairman McPhie, in <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. SBA</span>, 96 MSPR 518, 520-531 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-33 (2004), closely following the Federal Circuit's analysis in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A resignation or retirement is presumed to be voluntary; as such, it is not an appealable adverse action<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">Locke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 283, 287 (1994). The mere fact that an employee is faced with the unpleasant choice of either resigning or retiring, or opposing a potential removal for cause, does not rebut the presumed voluntariness of his ultimate choice to retire<span class="Italic">. Locke</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 287-88; <span class="Italic">accord Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Rather, for a resignation or retirement in such circumstances to be considered involuntary and therefore appealable as a constructive removal, the employee must establish that the agency did not have reasonable grounds for proposing removal<span class="Italic">. Locke</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 288; <span class="Italic">see also Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant argues on review that she was constructively removed because she decided to retire after the agency had proposed to remove her for cause. This contention is unavailing since she does not contest the AJ's explained finding that the agency had reasonable grounds for proposing her removal. The appellant also asserts that "[a]ll" of the AJ's findings "were incorrect and contrary to the evidence and law," but she does not identify any particular finding. Similarly, the appellant asserts that a retirement may be deemed involuntary if it resulted from intolerable working conditions, without discussing any particular aspects of her situation or any particular findings by the AJ that she believes were erroneous. <span class="Italic">Cf. Tines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 92 (1992) (a petition for review must contain sufficient specificity to enable the Board to ascertain whether there is a serious evidentiary challenge justifying a review of the record). Accordingly, the appellant's petition for review is denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Regardless of whether an appellant makes non-frivolous allegations that she was subjected to a constructive removal, if she fails to prove that she was constructively removed, then the appeal is not within the Board's jurisdiction and must be dismissed on that basis.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this appeal to address divergent lines of cases on the question of when Board jurisdiction over an alleged constructive removal appeal attaches. As explained below, we hold that, regardless of the strength of the appellant's allegations, an appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction if the appellant does not prove that she was constructively removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), which governs so-called "mixed cases," provides that, when an employee or applicant "has been affected by an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board" and "alleges that a basis for the action was [prohibited] discrimination," the Board "shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701 of this title and this section." Section 7701 sets forth procedures to be followed in Board appeals, and also provides that an agency action "may not be sustained" if it was based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, prohibited discrimination. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B). The Board and its reviewing court have considered the issue of whether an appeal in which the appellant alleges a constructive removal and discrimination should be treated as a mixed case governed by section 7702. This issue directly bears on the question at hand, namely, when Board jurisdiction over an alleged constructive removal appeal attaches.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 683 (1989), the appellant filed an appeal in which he claimed that the agency coerced his resignation with a baseless threat to remove him for cause. He also alleged that his constructive removal was the product of prohibited discrimination in the form of retaliation for filing discrimination complaints<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 451, 457 (1986) (retaliation for filing discrimination complaints is considered a form of prohibited discrimination). The AJ ruled that the appellant had made non-frivolous allegations that his resignation was involuntary and held a hearing. The AJ later issued an initial decision in which he concluded that the appellant's resignation was voluntary, finding that the agency had reasonable grounds to propose the appellant's removal and that the proposal to remove was not the product of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. at 684-85. On review, the Board agreed with the AJ's finding that the appellant was not constructively removed, but held that the AJ erred in addressing the appellant's discrimination claim because that claim lacked an independent jurisdictional basis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 687. The Board thus held that the appeal was not a mixed case under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 688 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon the appellant's petition for judicial review, a three-judge panel reversed the Board's decision. The panel did not disturb the Board's conclusion that the appellant's resignation was voluntary, but it nevertheless held that the appeal was "a mixed case over which the [B]oard had jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 906 F.2d 689, 690-91 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The government moved for rehearing before the full court. The motion was granted and the panel decision was vacated. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 918 F.2d 937 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On rehearing, the full court held that the Board was correct to conclude that the appeal was not a mixed case under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 because the appellant had failed to prove that he was affected by an appealable action to which a discrimination claim could be appended. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1244-45 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). The court held that, in considering the appellant's evidence of involuntariness, the Board was simply exercising its "jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1245. In the end, the Board "never acquired jurisdiction" because at the hearing the appellant failed to prove that his resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1248.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The gist of the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>--that Board jurisdiction over a constructive removal appeal is established only upon proof of a constructive removal, and not merely by the assertion of a non-frivolous constructive removal claim--is reflected in panel decisions issued before and after <span class="Italic">Cruz. See Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (the Board "possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned or retired if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her resignation or retirement was involuntary"); <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("the Board assumes jurisdiction over an appeal by an employee who has resigned or retired only if the employee shows that his resignation or retirement was involuntary"); <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 895 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("Mr. Dumas to establish jurisdiction must prove involuntariness").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not long after the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit advocated a different analytical approach to the jurisdictional determination in individual right of action (IRA) appeals. Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 empowers the Board to hear a claim for corrective action by an individual who believes that a personnel action was threatened, taken, or not taken because of his whistleblowing. In <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 689 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the court held that, when "a non-frivolous claim for relief has been asserted before the Board [in an IRA appeal], and the outcome is determined by whether the facts support that claim, a decision by the Board that they do not is a failure to prove the claim, not a lack of jurisdiction in the Board." The court opined that, in an IRA appeal, the Board should take jurisdiction based on a "well-pleaded complaint." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court recognized that this approach differed from that of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> where the court made clear that a non-frivolous constructive removal claim is not sufficient to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 688 &#x0026; n.12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Later panel decisions have reiterated the "well-pleaded complaint" approach to IRA jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">E.g., Spencer v. Department of the Navy,</span> 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003);<span class="Italic"> Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Department of the Army</span>, 219 F.3d 1332, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The Board has followed suit, and now holds that IRA jurisdiction attaches if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel and makes <span id="Page_1904"></span>certain non-frivolous allegations<span class="Italic">. Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 &#x00B6; 12 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may take jurisdiction in an IRA appeal when the requisite non-frivolous allegations are made without running afoul of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> because, unlike constructive removal appeals, IRA appeals are not governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 &#x0026; 7702; the appellant cannot raise a claim of prohibited discrimination in an IRA appeal<span class="Italic">. Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 638-39 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Thus, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 confers jurisdiction over a certain kind of <span class="Italic">claim</span>, while appeals governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 are within the Board's jurisdiction only if the appellant was affected by an <span class="Italic">action</span> that is appealable to the Board under some law, rule, or regulation<span class="Italic">. See Bodus v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 508 &#x00B6; 15 (1999). Despite this key distinction between constructive removal appeals and IRA appeals, at least two Federal Circuit panels have stated that Board jurisdiction attaches when the appellant makes non-frivolous allegations that he was constructively removed<span class="Italic">. See Dorrall v. Department of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AJ in this case determined that the appellant made non-frivolous allegations that she retired involuntarily and, pursuant to the panel decisions in <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, concluded that jurisdiction had been established. The Board must follow the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Amarille v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 424, 426 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 78 F.3d 605 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). An <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision is the controlling law of the circuit, however, unless and until it is overruled by the court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc. See</span> Fed. Cir. Rule 35(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Palm Beach Isles Associates v. United States</span>, 208 F.3d 1374, 1379 n.3 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reh'g</span>, 231 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">South Corp. v. United States</span>, 690 F.2d 1368, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 1982). Thus, it would be permissible to take jurisdiction based on the appellant's "well-pleaded complaint" of involuntary retirement only if doing so would be consistent with the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;If <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span> could be reconciled with the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, a separate problem would be whether to follow the pleadings-based approach to constructive removal jurisdiction in those panel decisions or the contrary, proof-based approach in the panel decisions in <span class="Italic">Shoaf,</span> <span class="Italic">Staats,</span> and <span class="Italic">Dumas</span>. We do not reach this issue because <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span> cannot be reconciled with <span class="Italic">Cruz.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before addressing whether <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> permits taking jurisdiction over a well-pleaded constructive removal claim, it is worth explaining why the issue outlined above is not idle theorizing about terminology; significant practical implications flow from the choice of approach to constructive removal jurisdiction. Again, once Board jurisdiction attaches in an appeal governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, the Board is obligated to decide any claim of prohibited discrimination, whereas the Board cannot address a discrimination claim when it lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B), 7702(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Fogerty v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 168, 170 (1992). Further, if a finding that the appellant failed to prove that he was constructively removed is considered to be "on the merits," then the decision carries <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect, whereas a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not<span class="Italic">. See Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995) (a decision must be "on the merits" to be given preclusive effect under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>). In addition, if jurisdiction over an appeal attaches upon the making of non-frivolous allegations of constructive removal, then at that stage the parties could enter into a Board-enforceable settlement agreement, whereas Board enforcement would be foreclosed under the view that jurisdiction does not attach until after a constructive removal is proven<span class="Italic">. See Bell v. Department of the Army</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 86, 91 (1991) (the Board cannot enforce a settlement agreement if the underlying appeal is not within the Board's jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Returning to <span class="Italic">Cruz,</span> we note that the court twice stated therein that the Board "never acquired jurisdiction" because the appellant did not prove he resigned involuntarily. 934 F.2d at 1248. Elsewhere the court stated that, in weighing the evidence of involuntariness, the Board was exercising "jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1244. A less-confusing way to state the latter point is that the Board has inherent <span class="Italic">authority</span> to determine whether a matter is within its jurisdiction. One post-<span class="Italic">Cruz</span> panel decision seems to have recognized that, when the Board is simply exercising its authority to determine its jurisdiction, it is not thereby assuming jurisdiction over the appeal and deciding the case on the merits<span class="Italic">. See Braun v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (the appellant's "non-frivolous allegation" that his resignation was coerced was sufficient to "trigger the Board's jurisdiction [to determine its jurisdiction] at this <span class="Italic">threshold</span> stage"; the appeal was remanded for an evidentiary hearing at which the appellant would bear "the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that his resignation was involuntary and that the [B]oard thus has <span class="Italic">jurisdiction to hear the merits</span>") (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span> panels, on the other hand, plainly meant something more than "authority to determine jurisdiction" when they stated that the Board has jurisdiction if a non-frivolous constructive removal claim is presented. Quoting from <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, 290 F.3d at 1361, the <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> panel stated that the Board "has jurisdiction over an appeal if the government employee makes non-frivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence." 301 F.3d at 1380. In a portion of its decision not quoted in <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span>, the <span class="Italic">Dick</span> panel was even more expansive, stating that "[a]fter making a non-frivolous allegation of the involuntariness of a retirement or resignation, an employee has a right to a hearing on voluntariness,...but such a hearing is a hearing on the merits, not a jurisdictional hearing." 290 F.3d at 1362 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These statements from <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span> cannot be reconciled with the unmistakable holding of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, which is that the Board "never acquire[s] jurisdiction" over the appeal if the appellant fails to prove that he was constructively removed. Since <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> is an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision, we are bound to follow it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's finding that the appellant's retirement was voluntary is affirmed. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCURRING OPINION OF NEIL A. G. MCPHIE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I have adopted the accompanying Opinion and Order because the disposition therein is correct under binding precedent, and because the Opinion and Order clarifies a potentially confusing area of the law. The issue this appeal presents is whether the Board acquires subject matter jurisdiction when a nonfrivolous claim of involuntary resignation or retirement is asserted. The Opinion and Order follows <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), which held that jurisdiction does not attach until an appellant <span class="Italic">proves</span> that a resignation was involuntary and, thus, tantamount to an actual removal. 934 F.2d at 1243-44. I write separately to explain why this approach is ripe for revision. But for the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, I would follow the Federal Circuit panel decision in <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and find that jurisdiction attaches when the appellant nonfrivolously alleges that the appellant's retirement or resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> was issued, the three-judge Federal Circuit panel in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> questioned the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. The <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> panel opined that the statement in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> that the Board "never had jurisdiction" over the appellant's claim of involuntary resignation because the appellant did not prove involuntariness at the hearing could not "be taken literally for all purposes, since the outcome [in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>] turn[ed] on a state of facts that [could] not be known until after the Board, and on appeal, this court, [took] jurisdiction and decided them." 978 F.2d at 688-89 (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1247). The <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> panel reasoned that, under the well pleaded complaint rule, subject matter jurisdiction attached when nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction were asserted, while a decision that a complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted or that a plaintiff failed to prove an essential factual allegation was a decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 687. Thus, when "a nonfrivolous claim for relief has been asserted before the Board, and the outcome is determined by whether the facts support that claim, a decision by the Board that they do not is a failure to prove the claim, not a lack of jurisdiction in the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 689.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> reasoning that subject matter jurisdiction attaches when nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction are asserted is consistent with the prevailing approach of federal courts in cases where jurisdiction and the merits are "intertwined." Subject matter jurisdiction and the merits are "intertwined" when the same statute "provides both the basis of federal court subject matter jurisdiction and the cause of action," <span class="Italic">Clark v. Tarrant County</span>, 798 F.2d 736, 742 (5th Cir. 1986), or when "resolution of the jurisdictional question requires resolution of an aspect of the substantive claim," <span class="Italic">Pringle v. United States</span>, 208 F.3d 1220, 1222-23 (10th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted). When "the basis for the federal [court's] jurisdiction is also an element of the plaintiff's federal cause of action," the case should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction unless the claim is "immaterial" or "wholly insubstantial and frivolous." <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 798 F.2d at 741-42 (relying on <span class="Italic">Bell v. Hood</span>, 327 U.S. 678 (1986)). The court should take jurisdiction and resolve the merits, <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Johnson County Youth Baseball League</span>, 838 F. Supp. 1437, 1440 (D. Kan. 1993), rather than determining the merits of the claim "under the guise of determining jurisdictional facts," <span class="Italic">McConnell v. Frank Howard Allen &#x0026; Co.</span>, 574 F. Supp. 781, 783-84 (N.D. Cal. 1983).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A case may be appropriately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction when, for example, the appellant fails to establish that he has standing to appeal an adverse action, <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 563 (1989), or the plaintiff fails to establish that the court can exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a wrongful death action, <span class="Italic">Darby v. Compagnie Nationale Air France</span>, 769 F. Supp. 1255 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). Ordinarily, it is unnecessary to resolve any aspect of the merits in order to decide questions of standing and personal jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1905"></span>In the present case, subject matter jurisdiction and the merits are intertwined. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1) and 7513(d), a "removal" is appealable to the Board. A voluntary resignation or retirement is not appealable, but a resignation or retirement brought about by agency coercion, duress, or misrepresentation is considered involuntary, and thus a "constructive removal" appealable under sections 7512(1) and 7513(d)<span class="Italic">. Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Statutes 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1) and 7513(d), therefore, provide both the basis for Board subject matter jurisdiction over an involuntary resignation or retirement and the "cause of action" for a constructive removal. And, resolution of the jurisdictional question in such an appeal--whether an appellant's resignation or retirement was involuntary--entails resolution of the substance of the appellant's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interconnection between jurisdiction and the merits is important because it has practical effects. According to <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, the Board may not decide the "merits" of a constructive removal claim unless the appellant proves that the retirement or resignation was involuntary. 934 F.2d at 1248. However, to determine whether an appellant has <span class="Italic">proven</span> involuntariness, the Board must consider and weigh the parties' evidence, sometimes even providing the parties with a full evidentiary hearing in order to decide "jurisdiction" under <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. The Board will dismiss the appeal for "lack of jurisdiction" if the appellant fails to prove that the resignation or retirement was involuntary, and the appellant walks away without a decision on the merits despite the fact that the Board has considered and weighed the evidence. But, if the resignation or retirement is determined to be involuntary and jurisdiction is found under <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, there is no later "merits" hearing; the Board simply reverses the removal because the appellant will not have received due process<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 162 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 6 (2000) (under <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), an agency's failure to provide a nonprobationary federal employee with prior notice and an opportunity to present a response to a proposed action that would be appealable violates due process and must be reversed). In other words, under <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, the jurisdictional stage is the end of the line before the Board; there is no independent "merits" phase.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The illogical nature of the jurisdictional approach in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> is particularly apparent in appeals involving allegations of prohibited discrimination. According to <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, a constructive removal appeal in which the appellant claims prohibited discrimination should not be considered reviewable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702--the section generally governing Board appeals involving discrimination claims--unless the appellant proves that the resignation or retirement was involuntary. 934 F.2d at 1243-45, 1248; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. As a practical matter, however, when an appellant alleges that he was forced to resign or retire as a result of prohibited discrimination, the Board may have to consider the merits of the discrimination claim to determine whether the appellant's resignation or retirement was involuntary. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hurwitz v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 436 (1994), the Board remanded the appeal for the administrative judge to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact on the appellant's claim that she was forced to resign because of intolerable working conditions that were the product of discrimination. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lorenz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 670 (2000), the Board remanded the appeal to give the appellant an opportunity to establish his claim that his disability retirement should be deemed involuntary because the agency should have granted his request for reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. Indeed, in the present case, the administrative judge considered (and ultimately found unproven) the appellant's claim that her resignation was the result of intolerable working conditions that were the product of prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even when the Board has, in fact, considered the merits of a discrimination claim in deciding that a resignation or retirement was voluntary, however,<span class="Italic"> Cruz</span> generally prevents it from actually ruling on the discrimination claims or from even advising appellants that they may seek judicial review in the district courts that normally consider claims of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Cruz</span>, 934 at 1247-48. Such partial consideration of claims leaves appellants feeling that they have not had their day in court when, in fact, the Board may have actually decided the discrimination issue as part of its involuntariness determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, the rule of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> does not match the reality of the manner in which the Board decides appeals of constructive removals. The unwieldy approach in that case is based on a fiction that subject matter jurisdiction and merits can be separated, when they are, in fact, intertwined. In my view, the Board should follow the approach in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> by finding jurisdiction when a nonfrivolous claim of involuntary resignation or retirement is asserted, by considering the appellant's discrimination claims along with the constructive removal claim, and by ruling on both of those claims.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;One practical question posed by the adoption of the approach laid out in decisions such as <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> is whether the appellant has the right to review before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) if he claims, but ultimately fails to prove, that his resignation or retirement was the result of prohibited discrimination. Under <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, the appellant would have no such review right. I do not reach this issue because, as stated in the Opinion and Order, under binding precedent in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> a case such as the one just described is not considered reviewable by the EEOC. Moreover, should <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> be abandoned, it would be up to the EEOC, not the Board, to determine the EEOC's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If federal courts find subject matter jurisdiction based on nonfrivolous allegations and decide proof issues on the merits, I see no reason why the Board should not also do so. It strikes me as illogical that an administrative forum like the Board should place a higher burden on its appellants to establish jurisdiction than do many courts. Limiting access to the Board through an unnecessarily restrictive approach to jurisdiction is not only inconsistent with other courts, but also inconsistent with the American tradition of making forums accessible to those who believe they have been wronged<span class="Italic">. See</span> Wright, Miller &#x0026; Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d &#x00A7; 2665 <span class="Italic">Costs--In General</span> (the American approach to costs, under which the prevailing party does not automatically recover costs, is supported by "arguments...founded on the egalitarian concept of providing relatively easy access to the courts to all citizens...").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Taking jurisdiction when a nonfrivolous claim of involuntary resignation or retirement is asserted would have salutary effects. As mentioned in the accompanying Opinion and Order, such an approach would create an opportunity for the parties to reach enforceable settlement agreements before a hearing, and disposition after a hearing would have <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect. Taking jurisdiction based on nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction would also encourage a more honest approach to considering and deciding claims of prohibited discrimination. Even appellants who fail to prove their allegations of discrimination will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that the Board examined their claims on the merits, rather than dismissing them on jurisdictional grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, some may argue that finding subject matter jurisdiction based on nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction would substantially increase the number of constructive removal appeals that are filed with the Board and require more lengthy decisions. So be it. The Board's authority and obligation to review appellants' claims should not be determined by considerations of convenience and workload. Such an outcome would be offensive to the principles of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant's claim that she resigned involuntarily was nonfrivolous, and neither party argues otherwise on review. Accordingly, if <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> were rejected and the framework outlined above were followed, the Board's ultimate conclusion that the appellant failed to prove her claim of involuntary resignation would be a disposition on the merits, not a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In my view, the <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> approach to determining jurisdiction over constructive removals is unfair, illogical, and inconsistent with other courts. It would be helpful to all concerned--from parties to practitioners, administrative judges, Board members, and even panels of the Federal Circuit[3] --for the full court to revisit <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> and to clarify whether it remains the law. At the present time, however, for the reasons stated in the accompanying Opinion and Order, the Board and its administrative judges are legally bound to follow <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge in the present case cannot be faulted for stating that Board jurisdiction attached when the appellant asserted a nonfrivolous claim of involuntary resignation. As noted in the Opinion and Order, recent panel decisions from the Federal Circuit state in emphatic terms that Board jurisdiction over a claim of involuntary resignation or retirement attaches upon the assertion of a nonfrivolous claim.<span class="Italic"> Dorrall v. Department of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002). These panel decisions make no mention of the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, however, and instead follow the prevailing view, detailed above, for handling cases in which subject matter jurisdiction and the merits are intertwined. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.;<span class="Italic"> cf. Colbath v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 Fed. Appx. 727 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (chastising the Board for not following <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> while failing to address the controlling <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>). Apparently the panels in <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, like the panel in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, believe that <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> "cannot be taken literally," 978 F.2d at 689. As described in the attached Opinion and Order, however, the Board is unwilling to independently reject the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The bottom line in these constructive adverse action cases, usually involving allegedly forced retirements or resignations, is that if the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant likely wins on the merits because of the virtual equivalence of a jurisdictional and merits determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 586, 601 &#x00B6; 46, 2009 MSPB 126 (2009) (prior decision, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 109 MSPR 392, 2008 MSPB 169 (2008), on further review following counsel fee petition, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 413, 2010 MSPB 221 (2010)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For there to be a constructive adverse action, the appellant must have taken <span id="Page_1906"></span>or suffered an action within the Board's defined jurisdiction, e.g., a removal or resignation. That the appellant who is still working believes her duties or status has been impaired or that her working conditions are hostile does not make out an appealable removal, constructive or otherwise, from a job, <span class="Italic">Britton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CH-3443-13-0089-I-1, n.4 (NP 3/5/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also mentions constructive termination. The Board has jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned or retired if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her resignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal. <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). It appears that the appellant is not asserting a constructive removal claim, but rather, misunderstands the concept. Separation from service is an implied prerequisite for any constructive removal claim. The appellant has not alleged that she was separated from service. Rather, below, she stated vaguely that there is an "overtone of constructive termination" within the agency. Her argument appeared to be that members of agency management subjected her to a hostile work environment in an attempt to force her to leave the agency, but she did not claim that she left the agency as a result. On review the appellant states that the agency "is engaged in constructive termination," which suggests to us that she is referring again to a perceived ongoing hostile work environment, rather than a constructive removal. To the extent that the appellant was entitled to jurisdictional notice with respect to her purported constructive removal claim, we discern no harm because she did not exercise her right to submit a reply to dispute the agency's argument, in its response to her petition for review, that she was not constructively removed because she remains an agency employee. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision); <span class="Italic">see also</span> PFR File, Tab 2 at 2 (Clerk of the Board advising the appellant of her right to file a reply); <span class="Italic">cf. Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 6 (2007) (failure to provide proper jurisdictional notice can be cured if the initial decision puts the appellant on notice of what she must do to establish jurisdiction, thus affording her the opportunity to meet her jurisdictional burden on review). We also note that on review the appellant requests "retirement with full benefits" as a remedy, further indicating that she is still employed with the agency.</p>
