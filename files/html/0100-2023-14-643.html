<p class="noindent">FLRA generally approves the negotiability of proposals providing a period for employees to improve performance or a notice period prior to a proposed action. Those proposals are negotiable procedures. <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, N. Chicago</span>, 27 FLRA 714, 734-37 (1987) (Proposal 7); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 540-41, 564 (1987) (Proposal 8: 90-day improvement period); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Veterans Benefits Administration and AFGE Council 53</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-211.html">71 FLRA 1113</a>, 1116-17 (2020) (Chairman Kiko dissenting in part) (recon. den., 72 FLRA 407 (2021)) (exceptions to arbitration award: VA "Accountability Act does not specify what actions an agency can or cannot do <span class="Italic">prior</span> to providing notice of a removal, demotion, or suspension"; "Because the award merely requires the Agency to comply with a provision it agreed to, it cannot excessively interfere with its management right to supervise and evaluate employees.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10 (1993) (reviewed, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 1994),
<span class="Italic">post</span>), allowed negotiation of specific
procedures to be followed in drafting performance improvement notices to employees, but FLRA disapproved a proposal that defined the level of improvement needed for job retention in a manner that differed from the statutory standard. Provision 45 in <span class="Italic">POPA</span> stated, 47 FLRA at 84-85:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Section 16--Performance-Based Disciplinary Actions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Warning</span>. A written notice of opportunity to improve must be given to an employee before the employee can be (1) reduced in grade, or (2) removed. The written notice must contain the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The performance standard that the employee performed at the unacceptable (or unsatisfactory) level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The factual basis for the determination that the employee performed at the unacceptable (or unsatisfactory) level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;A specific improvement period during which the employee's performance should improve. The specified improvement period will be seven pay periods unless the employee and his supervisor agree on a different specified improvement period of at least three pay periods.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The specific minimum improvement required to avoid further disciplinary action. This specific minimum improvement must be reasonably attainable during the specified improvement period. During the specified improvement period, appropriate on-the-job assistance will be given the employee if such assistance could result in improved performance and if the employee requests such assistance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;An identification, where appropriate, of the options available to the employee for improving performance, such as technical training, transfer to a different art or supervisor, academy courses, or the employee assistance program. Employees who are rated at a level below the fully successful level are entitled to special assistance for improving performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;At the midpoint of the improvement period, the employee shall be provided with a written evaluation of his/her progress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7.&#x2003;Management cannot take the action being warned about in the written notice of opportunity to improve until after the improvement period specified in the notice has expired. If, because of performance improvement by the employee during the notice period provided in the written notice of opportunity to improve the employee is not reduced in grade or removed, and the employee's performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the notice, any entry or other notation of the unsatisfactory performance for which the action was proposed shall be removed from any agency record relating to the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the 1993 <span class="Italic">POPA</span> litigation, FLRA explained what was negotiable and what was not, 47 FLRA at 86-88:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we conclude that the requirement in Provision 45 that the Agency provide a performance improvement plan for an employee facing performance-based disciplinary action is negotiable. However, we find that the requirement that the minimum improvement in performance be "reasonably attainable" excessively interferes with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency asserts that Provision 45 is inconsistent with Chapter 75 because that chapter does not require performance improvement plans before management takes performance-based disciplinary actions, nothing in Chapter 75 specifically precludes the use of performance improvement plans by an agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 46 (1987) (holding that an agency was not required to give an improvement period to an employee facing a Chapter 75 performance-based action, but that an agency might "elect[ ] to afford" an employee such an opportunity). It is well established that, where applicable law and regulation afford an agency discretion over a matter affecting conditions of employment, the agency is obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through bargaining, unless the law or regulation limits that discretion exclusively to the agency.... Accordingly, we conclude that the performance improvement period required by Provision 45 is not inconsistent with chapter 75.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;"<span class="Italic">Reasonably Attainable" Minimum Improvement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second sentence in section D.4 of Provision 45 provides that <span id="page_1086"></span>the minimum improvement required of an employee who is on a performance improvement plan to avoid disciplinary action must be "reasonably attainable." That is, the second sentence requires that employees improve their performance only to a reasonably attainable level rather than to the acceptable level. While, in some circumstances performance improvement to the acceptable level may be reasonably attainable, in others, an employee's performance may be so poor that reasonably attainable improvement would still be unacceptable performance. Therefore, under this criterion, the Agency would be prevented from imposing discipline when an employee improved, even though the employee was still performing unacceptably. Consequently, we find that the second sentence of section D.4 directly interferes with the Agency's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.... Unless this sentence constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, as the Union asserts, it is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By protecting from discipline those employees who are performing unacceptably if their performance improves to a "reasonably attainable" level under a performance improvement plan, the disputed portion of section D.4 ameliorates the adverse effect of management's exercise of its right to discipline. Therefore, the second sentence of section D.4 is intended as an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute for employees whose performance is unacceptable and who, as a result, may be demoted or terminated for failing to improve. Moreover, the disputed sentence of Provision 45 would benefit affected employees by limiting the performance improvement required during an improvement period to a "reasonably attainable" level. This provision would be of significant benefit to employees facing performance-based discipline because they could avoid disciplinary action by improving their performance to a reasonably attainable level, even though their performance fails to meet the acceptable level established in their performance elements and standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the disputed sentence imposes a burden on management's right by preventing the Agency from taking performance-based disciplinary action against an employee who has not demonstrated an ability to perform at the acceptable level during the performance improvement period. In this regard, the provision would eliminate management's discretion to decide on remedial action commensurate with the employee's performance deficiencies and consistent with the Agency's mission requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we conclude that the burden on management's right to impose discipline for unacceptable performance outweighs the benefit to employees afforded by the second sentence in section D.4. Accordingly, we conclude that the second sentence in section D.4 of Provision 45 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to take disciplinary action under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">On review in the D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 1148, 1156-57 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the court decided Provision 45 was nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Congress amended Chapter 43 of Title V (governing the evaluation of public employee work performance) when it enacted the CSRA, and provided a basis independent of Chapter 75 for demoting and removing employees for unsatisfactory performance<span class="Italic">. See Lovshin v. Department of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 834 (Fed. Cir. 1985).... Under Chapter 43, as amended, an employee who is rated "unsatisfactory" may be reduced in grade or removed without being subject to the substantive and procedural requirements of Chapter 75. Additionally, Congress strengthened management's hand by lowering its burden of proof when Chapter 43 actions are appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(A). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. ("A Chapter 43 action is...more narrowly reviewable by the board than a Chapter 75 case in which an agency must establish the facts underlying an adverse action by a preponderance of the evidence.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While acting to empower agencies to deal with unsatisfactory employees, Congress was careful to protect the rights of employees affected by performance-based actions. It provided several "due process" procedures with which an agency must comply before taking action under Chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See 5</span> USC &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1) (1988). Thus, Congress obviously intended to strike a delicate balance between the rights of management to eliminate poor performers and the rights of affected employees to procedural protections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's attempt to add to the procedural side of this equation in this case impermissibly frustrates the "dominant intent of [Congress]...'to simplify and expedite procedures for dismissals of Federal employees whose performance is below the acceptable level within a comprehensive framework for performance evaluation."' <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, 769 F.2d at 1564 (quoting S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2732). Indeed, proposal 45 would represent a large step back toward the problems inherent in performance-based actions arising under Chapter 75, and would substantially hamper management's ability to deal with unsatisfactory performers within the Agency. This is best illustrated by the proposal's requirement that only "reasonably attainable" performance improvements serve as a basis for performance-based discipline. As the Authority itself found, such a standard would interfere with management's rights by "protecting from discipline those employees who are performing unacceptably if their performance improves to a 'reasonably attainable' level under a performance improvement plan.... Finally, we agree with the Agency that requiring it to provide a written performance improvement plan any time it wishes to demote or dismiss an employee, impermissibly curtails its discretion to discipline employees through either Chapter 75 or Chapter 43. The Agency should be free to take such actions through Chapter 75, which does not require a performance improvement plan, and accept as a consequence the procedural obstacles and heightened burden of proof attendant to actions under that Chapter. For the reasons discussed, we hold that proposals 43 and 45 (in its entirety) are nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The length of the improvement period for an employee to demonstrate acceptable performance before a performance-based action may be instituted is subject to negotiation under <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO, Dept. of Commerce</span>, 29 FLRA 1389, 1402-04 (1987) (Proposal 7). A negotiable proposal required: that an employee be given adequate opportunity to improve performance; that appraisals state in detail the basis of a rating; that management make a sincere effort to assist the employee in improving performance to the desired level; that the employees be given a 90-day improvement period; that their notice of unacceptable performance state what action must be taken to improve their performance to an acceptable level and what assistance will be provided to them to improve their performance. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3804 and FDIC, Chicago Region</span>, 7 FLRA 217, 225-27 (1981) (Proposal 3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">New York State Nurses Ass'n and VA Bronx Med. Ctr.</span>, 30 FLRA 706, 751, 777 (1987) (Proposal 18: negotiable to propose that employee be given opportunity to improve performance before receiving unsatisfactory or marginal rating). A negotiable procedural proposal required the agency to provide a 90-day advance warning before giving an unsatisfactory rating to an employee. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 539, 564 (1987) (Proposal 8).</p>
<p class="noindent">Approved for bargaining in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1853 and U.S. Attorney's Office, E. Dist. of New York</span>, 29 FLRA 94, 101-04 (1987), was Provision 4, that if the employer changed or modified office technology, employees not skilled in the technology be provided a reasonable grace period, not less than 60 days, to bring performance related to the changed or modified technology to the satisfactory level. The proposal went on to state that during the grace period, action to discipline or otherwise adversely affect an employee for performance deficiencies relating to the technology will be initiated only for reasonable cause as will promote service efficiency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By way of background, it is clear that under law and regulation, management may evaluate an employee's performance at any point in the appraisal period and take disciplinary action against that employee if the employee's performance in one or more critical elements of the job is unacceptable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.203(a) (1987). However, before management may initiate an action under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 for unacceptable performance, it must first give the employee an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.... The opportunity...must consist of a reasonable time for the employee to demonstrate an ability to meet the minimum performance standards for the job.... Reasonable time is not defined in terms of a particular minimum or maximum period but rather as "an amount of time commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the employee's job which is sufficient to allow the employee to show whether he or she can meet established minimum performance standards." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.202. Moreover, OPM regulations contemplate that the length of the period of time considered reasonable may be negotiated. Attachment to Federal Personnel Manual Letter 432-1, III.10. at 3 (May 5, 1983), states that an agency must follow any minimum or maximum period it has negotiated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While an agency may take a performance based action under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43, it is not required to use this procedure exclusively. Instead, the agency may choose to take a performance based action under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985).... In such instances, the agency would have to establish that its performance based action was for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to Provision 4, the first portion remaining in dispute provides an employee with not less that [sic] 60 days to bring performance to the satisfactory level.... [T]his part of Provision 4 would establish through negotiations the length of the opportunity period required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(6) before a performance based action could be initiated under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303. Additionally, we find nothing in the express language of Provision 4 or in the record to indicate that an employee's performance during the "grace period" could not be evaluated or viewed as the basis for a performance based action. Therefore, we find that Provision 4 is consistent with 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 and does not violate management's right...to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the second portion of Provision 4 in dispute which permits the Agency to take a performance based disciplinary action <span id="page_1087"></span>against an employee during the "grace period" for reasonable cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. In this regard, and as we previously stated, an agency has the option to take a performance based disciplinary action against an employee under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75 for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal requested management to delay for six months an evaluation of employee performance concerning implementation of changes to an agency program. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Council of Consol. SSA Locals and DHHS, SSA</span>, 17 FLRA 657, 657-58 (1985). The proposal in <span class="Italic">NFFE, Council of Consol. SSA Locals</span> amounted to a training period for employees to familiarize themselves with revisions and was similar to the proposal in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 15 FLRA 541 (1984); it did not interfere with the right to assign work. A proposal was proper that delayed performance evaluation for 30 days after details or assignments to new positions, to permit a period of training of employees. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 22 FLRA 15, 22-25 (1986) (Proposal 6). A proposal was within the duty to bargain that management counsel marginal or unsatisfactory employees approximately 90 days before the due date of their proficiency reports. The proposal was nonnegotiable only to the extent that it identified the particular level of supervisor who was to conduct the counseling and in that way interfered with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 446-48 (1987) (Proposal 7).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that limited the circumstances permitting the issuance of a performance improvement plan (PIP). In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and DHHS, SSA, Dist. Office, Worcester</span>, 49 FLRA 1408, 1421-25 (1994), Proposal 3 was that management agree not to place any claims representative on a PIP solely based on reception duties. After deciding that the proposal was not a negotiable procedure (over Member Talkin's dissent), FLRA went on to announce that it was an inappropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...This proposal offers a significant benefit to employees by prohibiting the Agency from using reception duties as a basis for placing them on a PIP. Thus, the proposal protects employees from the adverse results, including removal, that could occur if unacceptable performance of reception duties provided the basis for placing an employee on a PIP. However, although Proposal 3 offers a significant benefit to employees, it also places severe restrictions on management's rights. By precluding the Agency from placing on a PIP an employee who has not met performance standards with regard to reception duties, the proposal limits management's ability to determine the means appropriate to enforce its performance standards. Moreover, under the proposal, the Agency would not be free to change its appraisal system to include a critical element based solely on reception duties because the plain language of the proposal would prohibit the Agency from placing on a PIP an employee who performed unsatisfactory work on that element. Consequently, on balance, we find that the restrictions that Proposal 3 places on management's rights to direct employees and assign work outweigh the benefits to employees and that this proposal excessively interferes with those rights. Accordingly, Proposal 3 is not negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statue.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to a proposal for a stay of the implementation of a performance appraisal system pending bargaining over its negotiable components, FLRA refused to approve as negotiable a provision that not only stayed implementation but gave the union options, including requiring implementation of a related contract article, at the completion of bargaining. Because the article that the union could seek to implement following the stay was not itself negotiable, the stay proposal as a whole was not negotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1214 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Army Training Ctr.</span>, 49 FLRA 215, 222-24 (1994) (Provision 2).
