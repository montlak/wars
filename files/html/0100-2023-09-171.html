<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-169"><span class="space">k.</span> Burden of Proof</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement is an LCA, the burden of proving compliance or breach rests at least initially on the appellant. Essentially the appellant will attempt to demonstrate that he met the terms of the agreement but the agency then improperly invoked the agreement against him. [Refer to settlement agreements in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-135.html#sec16-133">Burden of Proof; Proof of Compliance</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At first the Board imposed on the appellant the burden of demonstrating that the agency breached the agreement or acted in bad faith in implementing the agreement; the agency was not required to prove that it complied with the agreement, <span class="Italic">Link v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 254, 258-60 (1993), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Link v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The question here is whether the fact that the threshold issue before the Board involves the issue of the breach of a last-chance settlement agreement, requires the shifting of that burden to the agency after the appellant makes an initial non-frivolous allegation of breach. We conclude that it does not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit has held that where an appellant raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with a last-chance settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue, including holding a hearing, where appropriate, before addressing the scope and applicability of the appeal rights waiver. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148. In arriving at this determination, the court relied on an earlier holding in <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988), that where an agency acts in bad faith or takes other arbitrary or capricious action, as a breaching party, it would be unable to enforce the last-chance settlement agreement. As noted by the administrative judge in his order certifying interlocutory appeal, the court did not address specifically the issue of whether the appellant or the agency should bear the burden of proof on that issue. However, we construe <span class="Italic">Stewart's</span> reference to "the threshold issue of breach" as meaning the issue overall, not the appellant's breach. If the breach at issue were, in fact, the appellant's, it would be the agency that bears the burden of proof on appeal....&#8197;Instead, the court held that the appellant has the burden of proof on jurisdiction. To reconcile those points, we conclude that it is more reasonable to find that it is the appellant who is asserting breach in that the agency removed him absent any valid reason to do so, contrary to the agreement. While we acknowledge that resolution of this issue is not without ambiguity, we find for the reasons discussed below that this analysis best comports with case law and policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1146"></span>[W]e hold here that the ultimate burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, is on the appellant, as the party seeking to establish that the agency has breached the settlement agreement or acted in bad faith by failing to fulfill the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The burden is not upon the agency to prove it has honored the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit interceded to clarify the burden on the appellant who seeks to avoid the effect of a failed LCA on the basis of the agency's failure to adhere to the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Link v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1579-84 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the court determined that the significant components of the equation are whether the appellant failed to meet the conditions of the agreement and whether the agency breached the agreement. A material agency breach alone is sufficient to avoid the effect of the agreement on the appellant. The issue is one of compliance with or breach of the agreement, not bad faith motivation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Link was employed as an auditor by Customs in its Southeast Region in Charlotte, North Carolina. In November of 1990, the agency removed him for unacceptable performance, pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303. After Link appealed the removal to the Board, he and the agency settled the case by entering into a last-chance agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last-chance agreement provided that Link be reinstated to his position as an auditor and then be evaluated over an eight-month period. During this evaluation period, Link first would undergo two months of training and then would be given six months during which to demonstrate acceptable job performance. If, at the end of the eight-month evaluation period, Link's performance was deemed acceptable, he would be returned to his position on a permanent basis. If, on the other hand, his performance was deemed unacceptable, the removal would be reinstated and he would be permanently separated from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Five provisions of the last-chance agreement are relevant to this appeal. In Article 4, Customs agreed that it would not scrutinize Link's performance any more or any less strictly than that of any other employee. Article 6 of the agreement provided that, if at the end of the eight-month evaluation period Link's performance was deemed unacceptable by his supervisors, his work would be reviewed "by the Regional Director of another region outside the Southeast Region." Article 6 further provided that "[a]ny memorandums concerning Mr. Link's performance written by Agency employees or Mr. Link will...be provided to the reviewing Regional Director." Article 7 of the agreement provided that if the reviewing Regional Director agreed that Link's work was unacceptable, the removal action would be reinstated and Link would be removed for unacceptable performance. However, Article 9 provided that if the reviewing Regional Director did not agree that Link's work was unacceptable, Link would be allowed to keep his job. Finally, in Article 8 of the agreement, Link agreed that if he was removed for unacceptable performance, he would waive his right to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Link returned to work under the last-chance agreement in June of 1991. In due course, after successfully completing two months of training, he was assigned to perform a customs audit of certain "Pic N Pay" stores. In early October, after he had begun work on the Pic N Pay audit, Link was visited by a co-worker who examined his work papers and determined that the audit was progressing satisfactorily. Thereafter, co-workers visited Link on a monthly basis to discuss the audit with him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 15, 1992, John Jasman, Link's immediate supervisor, directed Link to submit all of his audit work papers on January 24 for a performance review, as required by the last-chance agreement. Upon receiving the work papers, Mr. Jasman instructed Chad Nesbit and Larry Goodman, two of Link's co-workers, to conduct a peer review of the Pic N Pay audit. After reviewing the work papers from the audit, Messrs. Nesbit and Goodman concluded that Link's work was unacceptable because he had failed to substantiate a number of his conclusions and findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Mr. Nesbit and Mr. Goodman had completed their peer review, Link's audit work papers and the audit review sheets were reviewed by Mr. Jasman and by Patricia Goldman, the Southeast Region's Regional Director for Regulatory Audits. Mr. Jasman and Ms. Goldman agreed with Mr. Nesbit and Mr. Goodman that Link's work on the audit was unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Link responded to Mr. Jasman's notice of deficiencies on February 14. In his response, Link argued that Customs had violated Article 4 of the last-chance agreement because it had reviewed his work more rigorously than that of other employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On April 14, Customs informed Link that, in accordance with the last-chance agreement, it was reinstating his November 1990 removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Link appealed his reinstated removal to the Board, Treasury moved to dismiss, arguing that the Board lacked jurisdiction because Link had waived his appeal rights in the last-chance agreement. Link responded that Customs was not entitled to have the waiver enforced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, on March 10, 1993, the AJ dismissed Link's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ started from the premise that, in order to establish jurisdiction, Link had to prove 1) that he had complied with the last-chance agreement, 2) that Customs had breached the agreement by acting in bad faith or arbitrarily and capriciously, or 3) that he had not entered into the agreement knowingly and voluntarily. Link contended that he had complied with the agreement because he had performed satisfactorily and that, in any event, Customs had breached the agreement. As far as breach was concerned, Link claimed that Customs had violated Article 4 by reviewing his work more rigorously than that of other employees. Link also claimed that Customs had failed to comply with Article 6 because the Southeast Region had not provided Mr. Whitworth with either the audit review sheets showing Link's comments and the clearances by Mr. Nesbit, or the memoranda concerning his training and the visits of his co-workers to the audit site.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a hearing, the AJ concluded that Link had failed to prove that he had complied with the last-chance agreement because, in the five instances identified in the notice of deficiencies, he had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his audit conclusions. The AJ also rejected Link's breach claims....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, Link had the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) (1994); <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d 1164, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 642-43 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Board has taken the position that it lacks jurisdiction over adverse actions where, as here, an individual has waived his or her appeal rights in a last-chance agreement<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 668-69 (Fed. Cir. 1988). However, a waiver of appeal rights will not be enforced if an agency breaches a last-chance agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 667.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Link makes two arguments. First, he contends that the AJ erred as a matter of law in holding that, in order to establish breach on the part of Customs, he had to show that the agency acted in bad faith or arbitrarily and capriciously. According to Link, it was enough for him to show that Customs breached the agreement by not affording him the procedural protections for which he had bargained. Second, Link argues that, under the standard which should have been applied by the AJ, he established that the agency breached Articles 4 and 6 of the last-chance agreement and that therefore the agency was not entitled to have the waiver of appeal rights enforced against him....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ correctly stated that Link could overcome his waiver of appeal rights by proving that he complied with the last-chance agreement, that Customs breached the agreement, or that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement. From that point, however, the AJ erred by taking too narrow a view of what constitutes breach of a last-chance agreement. A last-chance agreement is a settlement agreement, and a settlement agreement is a contract. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Because it is an implied term of every contract that each party will act in good faith towards the other, a party may breach a contract by acting in bad faith<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Solar Turbines, Inc. v. United States</span>, 23 Cl. Ct. 142, 155-56 (1991). A party is not limited to proving breach in that manner, however. It may establish breach by proving that the other party failed to comply with a provision of the contract in a way that was material, regardless of the party's motive<span class="Italic">. See e.g., Stone Forest Indus., Inc. v. United States</span>, 973 F.2d 1548, 1551-53 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Thus, the AJ erred in starting from the premise that, in order for Link to establish that Customs had breached the last-chance agreement, he had to prove that it had acted in bad faith. Link also was entitled to establish breach by showing that the agency failed to comply in a material way with the provisions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ cited a statement in <span class="Italic">McCall</span> for the proposition that Link had to prove that Customs acted in bad faith or arbitrarily and capriciously. In <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, a Postal Service employee sought to overcome the appeal rights waiver in his last-chance agreement by arguing that a certain provision in the agreement impermissibly opened the door to "subjective evaluation by the agency" and that therefore the agreement was invalid. <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 667. The <span class="Italic">McCall</span> court rejected the contention. In so doing, it made the statement upon which the AJ relied in this case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We agree that the term [at issue] does introduce an element of subjectivity into the agreement, but this does not mean that agencies would have a free hand to take arbitrary action against employees. We think it is implicit in the agreement here that the agency must abide by it in good faith. Thus, the agreement itself serves as a check on arbitrary agency action. If an agency acts in bad faith or takes other arbitrary and capricious action, as a breaching party it would not be able to enforce the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, in addressing McCall's contention that his last-chance agreement was invalid, the court simply relied upon the well-established principle that it is an implied term of every contract that the parties will deal in good faith with each other. In short, there is nothing in <span class="Italic">McCall</span> which can be read as a holding that, in order to establish breach of a last-chance settlement agreement, a party must prove that the agency acted in <span id="Page_1147"></span>bad faith or arbitrarily and capriciously. This is not surprising, for such a holding would be contrary to settled principles of contract law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether non-compliance with the provisions of a contract is material, so as to result in breach of the contract, depends on "the nature and effect of the violation in light of how the particular contract was viewed, bargained for, entered into, and performed by the parties." <span class="Italic">Stone Forest Indus., Inc.</span>, 973 F.2d at 1550-51. For the following reasons, we hold that the failure of the Southeast Region to provide Mr. Whitworth with the fully-completed audit review sheets and the memoranda relating to Link's training and the visits of co-workers to the audit site was material non-compliance with Article 6 of the last-chance agreement. Therefore it constituted breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, Link was deprived of the full benefit of Mr. Whitworth's review, for which he had bargained, because Mr. Whitworth was not provided with all the documents relating to Link's performance, as required by Article 6 of the last-chance agreement. For this reason, we hold that Customs breached the last-chance agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Customs breached the last-chance agreement, Treasury is not entitled to have the waiver of appeal rights in the agreement enforced against Link. Accordingly, the decision of the Board dismissing Link's appeal of the reinstated 1990 removal action for lack of jurisdiction is reversed. The case is remanded to the Board, which is instructed to reinstate the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burdens of pleading and proof in an appellant's petition to enforce an LCA were reviewed in <span class="Italic">Edmonds v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 677, 680 (1995), an appeal seeking reversal of the appellant's removal under the agreement. The Board suggested that both parties are required to provide evidence of their compliance, or the opposing party's noncompliance, with the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who seeks enforcement of a last-chance settlement agreement bears the burden of proving that the agency breached that agreement. <span class="Italic">McClure v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 172, 175-76 (1994); <span class="Italic">Fredendall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 371 (1988), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds, Jones v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 252, 254 (1994). The appellant must offer evidence in the form of documentation or affidavits to support his claims of noncompliance. <span class="Italic">See Vincent v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 263, 268-69 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of proof, however, does not rest entirely on the appellant. The agency must provide relevant, material, and credible evidence of compliance. <span class="Italic">Reniere v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 62 MSPR 648, 651 (1994); <span class="Italic">Kolassa v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 59 MSPR 151, 154, review dismissed, 52 F.3d 340 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">Fredendall,</span> 38 MSPR at 371. Mere assertions of compliance are insufficient to meet this showing. The agency must produce documentation or affidavits showing compliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> Vincent, 32 MSPR at 268-69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record is insufficient to determine the parties' compliance or noncompliance with the last-chance settlement agreement. The appellant merely alleged that the agency had not complied with certain provisions of the last-chance settlement agreement, and the agency asserted that it had complied. The parties offered no evidence in support of their assertions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the acknowledgment order did not apprise the appellant of what evidence he was required to produce to meet his burden of proof of agency noncompliance with the last-chance settlement agreement. The administrative judge should have informed the appellant that he had the burden of proving noncompliance and that he was required to offer evidence in the form of documentation or affidavit to either support his claims of noncompliance or rebut the agency's claim of compliance. <span class="Italic">See McClure</span>, 63 MSPR at 175-76; <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span>, 38 MSPR at 371. Also, the administrative judge should have informed the agency that it was required to produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of compliance in the form of documentation or affidavits. <span class="Italic">See Reniere</span>, 62 MSPR at 651; <span class="Italic">Kolassa</span>, 59 MSPR at 154; <span class="Italic">Vincent</span>, 32 MSPR at 268-69.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gibson v. VA</span>, 160 F.3d 722, 726 (Fed. Cir. 1998), recapitulated the burden of an appellant seeking to avoid an LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gibson had the burden of establishing jurisdiction before the Board by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) (1998); <span class="Italic">Link v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995). On the merits of the breach of the agreement issue, the AJ found that the "appellant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he did not breach the last-chance agreement." <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, slip op. at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Walters v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 63 MSPR 348, 353 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 61 F.3d 919 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table)). This appears to be a correct statement of the burden on a petitioner as articulated by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Link</span>, 51 F.3d at 1582 ("Link could overcome his waiver of appeal rights by proving that he complied with the last-chance agreement, that Customs breached the agreement, or that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement." (dicta)); <span class="Italic">Rogers v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 59 MSPR 647, 651 (1993) ("[T]he appellant was required to show that the appeal-rights waiver should not be enforced against him because he did not violate the agreement."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 59 F.3d 181 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Is the issue good faith or bad faith or simply noncompliance with the LCA, and who shoulders the burden of proof? Decisions of the Board and the Federal Circuit are mixed. <span class="Italic">Connolly v. DOJ</span>, DC-0752-14-1120-I-1 (NP 9/25/2015), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we reject the appellant's suggestion that the agency bears the burden of proof on this issue. Rather, it is the appellant who bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a waiver of appeal rights in an LCA should not be enforced. <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6; 17 (2007).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Where, as here, an appellant seeks to prove Board jurisdiction over an appealable matter by showing that the agency breached an LCA waiving her right to appeal, she must establish that the agency breached the agreement in a material way, regardless of motive, or otherwise breached the agreement by acting in bad faith. <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1995). As discussed above, the appellant takes the position that, even in the absence of bad faith, an agency may materially breach an LCA by failing to act in good faith. If so, the burden of proof nonetheless remains with the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant contends that the agency did not follow the last chance agreement in good faith, the AJ should address that issue specifically in an initial decision dismissing an appeal on the basis of the agreement. The AJ's finding on the issue may, however, be indirect. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 621, 626-27 (1993), the Board read "good faith" into the AJ's analysis: "In concluding that there was no basis for the appellant's claims of reprisal for whistleblowing and general animosity towards him, the AJ found, in effect, that the appellant failed to make a showing that the agency had acted in bad faith in enforcing the agreement against him."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Bad faith implementation of a last chance agreement must be distinguished from the harsh or severe consequences of application of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nwachie v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3584) (agreement was not breached when the employee agreed that any unauthorized absence during the course of a year would result in removal and the employee was removed after one day of AWOL). The element of willful misconduct is not necessarily a component of the analysis of whether a breach of the LCA occurred, <span class="Italic">Mann v. VA</span>, SF-0752-15-0529-I-1 (NP 6/9/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly found, the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that he complied with the LCA. In his petition for review, the appellant argues that he did not breach the LCA because his actions were not "intentional or willful" and "did not rise to the level of misconduct by a federal employee." We do not agree. Paragraph 2b of the LCA states the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Employee agrees to demonstrate his reliability, dependability, and trustworthiness for Federal employment by maintaining acceptable standards of conduct and performance. The Employee understands that for the duration of this Agreement, one instance of noncompliance with this Agreement, including, but not limited to, disrespectful conduct; unexcused tardiness; absence without leave; failure to comply with instructions; and/or any other validated unethical misconduct, will be cause for immediate removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute the facts surrounding his alleged breach of the LCA. We find that, by failing to properly park a Government vehicle and follow gravesite verification procedures, the appellant did not maintain acceptable standards of conduct and performance as a Motor Vehicle Operator. We also do not interpret the LCA as creating an "intentional or willful" standard of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (finding that an LCA is subject to contract law, and therefore breach can be established by proving material noncompliance, regardless of motive).</p>
