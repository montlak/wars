<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">ACT Texas Lone Star Chap. 100 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Texas</span>, 55 FLRA 1226 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">ACT, Texas Lone Star Chap. 100 v. FLRA</span>, 250 <span id="page_856"></span>F.3d 778, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>, were proposals that applicants for wage leader positions be eligible for appointment without regard to whether the individual appointed would hold a military rank below that of an individual supervised by the wage leader. At issue was the military grade inversion policy, based in statute. The policy precluded negotiability, 55 FLRA 1228-30:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Military Aspects of Conditions of Employment Are Outside the Duty to Bargain</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that National Guard technicians may not bargain concerning "the military aspects of civilian technician employment." <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Schenectady Chapter</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau, New York Air National Guard, Latham New</span> <span class="Italic">York, </span>55 FLRA 925, 932-33 (1999) (<span class="Italic">ACT, New York</span>) (Member Cabaniss, concurring in part as to Proposal 6, and Member Wasserman, dissenting in part as to Proposal 6), <span class="Italic">appeal filed sub nom. Association of Civilian</span> <span class="Italic">Technicians, Schenectady Chapter v. FLRA, </span>No. 99-1476 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 28, 1999); <span class="Italic">National Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees, Local 1669 and U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, Arkansas Air National Guard, 188th Fighter</span> <span class="Italic">Wing, Fort Smith, Arkansas, </span>55 FLRA 63, 65 (1999) (<span class="Italic">ACT, Arkansas</span>), <span class="Italic">enforced sub nom. Arkansas National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard v. FLRA, </span>No. 99-1563, 99-1974 (Oct. 14, 1999), <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Montana Air Chapter and Department of the Air Force, Montana Air</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard, Headquarters, 120th Fighter Interceptor Group, (ADTAC), </span>20 FLRA 717, 739 (1985) (<span class="Italic">ACT,</span> <span class="Italic">Montana</span>). This holding arises only in the unique employment situation of dual status employees. In addressing this issue, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained that "National Guard technicians are both civilian employees and enlistees in National Guard units. The two worlds they simultaneously inhabit are understandably governed by very different rules of employee-employer relations." <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1623, </span>852 F.2d at 1350.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent holding that National Guard technicians may not bargain concerning military aspects of civilian technician employment has been based on three distinct rationales.&#x2003;First, it has been based on a statutory analysis of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c) [2], which prohibits bargaining with, or on behalf of, members of the military.[3] Second, it has been based on a statutory analysis of the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 <span class="Italic">et seq. </span>(Technicians Act) [4], which provides, among other things, that as a condition of civilian employment, technicians must be members of the National Guard.[5] Third, it has been based on the conclusion that military matters do not concern conditions of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that it shall be "unlawful" to:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Unions challenge the third basis relied upon in prior Authority decisions.&#x2003;They argue that the "specifically provided for by Federal law" exception to the definition of the term "condition of employment" in section 7103(a)(14) does not apply to situations where an agency can exercise discretion over the matter proposed for bargaining, such as the military grade inversion policy at issue in this case. The Unions assert that <span class="Italic">NFFE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1623, </span>in which the court addressed this issue, is "not good law," because the court erroneously found that the matter at issue was not a condition of employment, despite the fact that the matter was within the agency's discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Unions' argument points to a confusing aspect of the Authority's prior precedent that was clarified in <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace</span> <span class="Italic">Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677, 681-85 (1995) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>),<span class="Italic"> aff'd mem. sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom. Bureau of Engraving and Printing v. FLRA</span>, 88 F.3d 1279. Consistent with the Union's argument here, in <span class="Italic">BEP</span> the Authority clarified that the "specifically provided for" exception to the definition of "conditions of employment" in section 7103(a)(14) applies only where the statute at issue provides the agency with no discretion. Thus, as the Unions correctly assert, matters within an agency's discretion are not "specifically provided for by Federal law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Unions' assertion, however, the clarification in <span class="Italic">BEP </span>does not mean that <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1623 </span>was incorrectly decided. <span class="Italic">BEP</span> explained that matters that fall within the definition of "condition of employment" may nevertheless be outside the duty to bargain if bargaining is "inconsistent with any Federal law" under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute. For example, there is no duty to bargain "where law or applicable regulation vests an agency with sole and exclusive discretion over a matter, [and] it would be contrary to law to require that discretion to be exercised through collective bargaining." <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 50 FLRA at 691. <span class="Italic">See NFFE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1623, </span>852 F.2d at 1352 (question of compatibility is a military issue, which section 709(b) "left entirely to the discretion of the Secretary of the Army or the Air Force").[7] Therefore, even though a matter does not properly fall within an exception to the definition of "conditions of employment" in section 7103(a)(14), bargaining will nevertheless be foreclosed if a proposal is inconsistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;On this point, the Unions incorrectly contend that the court's holding in <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1623 </span>is inconsistent with the court's later decision in <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard v. FLRA,</span> 854 F.2d 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard</span>). Contrary to the Unions' assertions, <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard</span> did not hold that a matter cannot be found within an agency's unfettered discretion unless the statutory provision at issue contains the phrase "notwithstanding any other provision of law." In this connection, the Authority has consistently held that, in determining whether an agency's discretion is unfettered or "sole and exclusive," the Authority examines the plain wording and the legislative history of the statute being relied on. <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Mile High Chapter and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Colorado Air National Guard, 140th</span> <span class="Italic">Fighter Wing, </span>53 FLRA 1408, 1412 (1998) (holding that section 709(b)(3) of the Technicians Act--which does not include the phrase "notwithstanding any other provision of law"--provides the Secretary with sole and exclusive discretion over military uniforms).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The limitation on bargaining over military aspects of civilian technician employment is based on the Technician Act and is also based on section 976 of title 10, which expressly prohibits bargaining over the "terms or conditions" of military service. Contrary to the arguments advanced by the Unions, there is no indication that the section 976 prohibition is limited to only "military decisions[,]" such as the "award of military ranks." Rather, the prohibition applies more broadly to "terms or conditions of service of such members[.]" 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2). With respect to dual status technicians, whose day-to-day work lives have both civilian and military components, the prohibition applies to the military aspects of civilian technician employment. Those terms and conditions are outside the duty to bargain without regard to whether or not they are either (1) within the sole discretion of an agency or (2) specifically provided for by law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the conclusion that National Guard technicians may not negotiate over military aspects of civilian employment is not compelled by the definition of conditions of employment contained in section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute. Instead, the conclusion results from the application of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976, the Technicians Act, and section 7117(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Instant Proposals Are Outside the Duty to Bargain Because They Concern Military Aspects of Civilian Technician Employment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the military grade inversion policy at issue in this case, a full time civilian technician may not supervise any individual with a higher military rank than the military rank of the supervisor. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Guard Regulation 600-25, Chapter 2, paragraph 2-1a. A National Guard policy guidance clarifies that the grade inversion policy applies to Wage Leaders: "the military grade of a technician occupying a Wage Leader position must equal or exceed the military grade of the subordinate personnel."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that proposals relating to the implementation and application of the military grade inversion policy are outside the duty to bargain because they concern the military aspects of civilian technician employment.... In <span class="Italic">ACT, New York, </span>55 FLRA at 930, the Authority recently reiterated this holding, finding two proposals outside the duty to bargain because they concerned the military's policy on inversion of rank. As relevant here, Proposal 4 in <span class="Italic">ACT, New York </span>would have permitted civilian technicians to remain in shop chief positions even if military technicians with higher military rank were assigned to the same shop<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of &#x00A7; 709(b) of title 32 clearly supports the Authority's conclusion that the military grade inversion policy is a military aspect of civilian technician employment. Specifically, the House Report <span id="page_857"></span>accompanying the Technicians Act as originally introduced explains the necessity of the grade inversion policy as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It has...been the practice of the Secretary concerned to designate certain positions as "officer positions," others as "enlisted positions," which can be filled only by individuals who hold the appropriate grade in the National Guard. There is a high correlation between the duties of the technician in his military and civilian capacities.... <span class="Italic">In the interest of efficiency and discipline, a military commander should not be a civilian subordinate of a member of his unit. Such inversions may be prevented by authorizing the Secretary concerned to establish the military grade required for employment in a particular technician position</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">H.&#x2003;Rep. No. 13, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 58-59 (1967) (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See also ACT, Montana, </span>20 FLRA at 725.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposals at issue here would, in effect, prohibit the Agencies from enforcing the grade inversion policy as it applies to Wage Leader positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Conference Record at 2. Consistent with the Authority precedent described above, including the Authority's analysis of proposal 4 in <span class="Italic">ACT, New York, </span>the proposals at issue concern a military aspect of civilian technician employment.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Unions argue that the National Guard's grade inversion policy does not foreclose bargaining because it is set forth in a regulation for which the Agencies do not claim there is a compelling need. However, the issue presented in this case is whether the subject matter of the proposals concerns a military aspect of civilian technician employment, not whether the proposals are inconsistent with an agency regulation for which compelling need is asserted.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT Lone Star Chap. 100</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">ACT, Texas Lone Star Chap. 100 v. FLRA</span>, 250 F.3d 778, 780 (D.C. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Guard Technician Act of 1968, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b), provides that, as a condition of civilian employment, technicians must, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, be members of the National Guard and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned. And &#x00A7; 709(a) of the Technician Act, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(a), specifies that persons are employed as technicians "[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force." Pursuant to this statutory authority, the Departments of the Army and the Air Force have promulgated regulations prohibiting military "grade inversion" in the National Guard. Under this policy, the military grade of a full-time supervisor must equal or exceed the military grade of personnel supervised. The grade inversion policy has been clarified to apply to persons assigned to Wage Leader positions in the National Guard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Association of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100 ("Texas-ACT"), and the Association of Civilian Technicians, Wisconsin Chapter 26 (Army) ("Wisconsin-ACT") (together, the "Unions"), the recognized collective bargaining agents for technicians employed by the Texas National Guard and the Wisconsin National Guard, submitted bargaining proposals that would have allowed for the assignment of technicians to Wage Leader positions without restriction based on the technicians' military grade. When the proposals were found to be nonnegotiable by the Offices of the Adjutant General, the Unions filed negotiability appeals with Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA" or "Authority").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found that the duty to bargain in good faith did not extend to Unions' proposals because National Guard technicians may not negotiate over military aspects of civilian technician employment. <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians Texas Lone Star Chapter 100</span>, 55 FLRA (No. 196) 1226 (2000); <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. (No. 63) 432 (2000) (order denying motion for reconsideration).... This conclusion based on the Authority's consideration of three statutory provisions: 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2), which prohibits bargaining with, or on behalf of, members of armed forces, concerning the terms or conditions of their service; &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1), which prohibits bargaining over matters inconsistent with any federal law; and the of cited &#x00A7; 709 of the Technician Act. <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100</span>, 55 F.L.R.A. at 1229.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We deny the petition for review.&#x2003;The Unions' proposals are outside of the duty to bargain under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1), because they are inconsistent with &#x00A7; 709(b). <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100</span>, 55 F.L.R.A. at 1229. The legislative history of &#x00A7; 709(b) clearly supports the Authority's conclusion that, in requiring civilian technicians to "[h]old the military grade specified by the Secretary," &#x00A7; 709(b) directs a civilian technician to occupy a military grade equal to or exceeding that of subordinate personnel. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Mont. Air Chapter</span>, 20 FLRA (No. 85) 717 (1985), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied</span>, 809 F.2d 930 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Table). Because our decision rests principally on &#x00A7; 709, we need not reach the Unions' claim that the disputed proposals are negotiable subjects because they do not invite bargaining over a term or condition of military service in violation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Texas and Wisconsin chapters of the Association of Civilian Technicians represent technicians employed by the Texas National Guard and the Wisconsin National Guard (the "Guards"). National Guard technicians are federal civilian employees, but they "perform even their civilian tasks 'in a distinctly military context, implicating significant military concerns.'" <span class="Italic">Illinois Nat'l Guard v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1396, 1398 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">New Jersey Air Nat'l Guard v. FLRA</span>, 677 F.2d 276, 279 (3d Cir. 1982)). National Guard technicians are, thus, considered to be "dual status" employees<span class="Italic">. See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216; 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b). As a prerequisite for their employment, technicians must be members of the National Guard unit in which they are employed, maintain the military grade specified for their positions, and wear their military uniforms while working<span class="Italic">. See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b); <span class="Italic">see also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Schenectady Chapter v. FLRA</span>, 230 F.3d 377, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 31, 1995, the Departments of the Army and the Air Force promulgated National Guard Regulation 600-25 and Air National Guard Instruction 36-102, prescribing the Guards' military inversion policy, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Military grade inversion within the fulltime work force is not permitted. The grade inversion concept is inconsistent with the nature of the National Guard. The military grade of the full-time supervisor must equal or exceed the military grade of personnel supervised. Unit of assignment or service component of the individual does not change this policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Personnel General: Military Technician Compatibility, NGR 600-25/ANGI 36-102 at 2-l.a. (Mar. 31, 1995), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 29, 46.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nearly three years later, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau for the Departments of the Army and the Air Force issued a policy guidance, clarifying that the military grade inversion policy applied to Wage Leaders. <span class="Italic">See</span> Memorandum from Steve Nelson, Director for Human Resources, National Guard Bureau, NGBHRC 690-500 (Jan. 7, 1998), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 27. Subsequently, in February 1999, the Wisconsin-ACT submitted the following bargaining proposal to the Wisconsin National Guard:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A Wage Leader employee shall not, as a condition of employment, be required to hold a military rank which is equal to or exceeds the military ranks of the employees with whom the Wage Leader works.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Memorandum from Leslie J.&#x2003;Hackett, President, Wis. Ass'n of Civilian Technicians Chapter 26 Army, to Col. James Krueck, Wis. Nat'l Guard-Human Resources (Feb. 2, 1999), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 21. One month later, the Texas-ACT submitted a similar proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee shall be eligible to apply for, to be selected for, and to be appointed to, a Wage Leader position, or a position that requires work with a Wage Leader, without restriction based on whether the employee's appointment would result in the Wage Leader having a military rank below that of any employee with whom the Wage Leader works.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Offices of the Adjutant General found both proposals to be nonnegotiable.... The Unions then filed negotiability appeals with the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 14, 2000, the Authority issued a Decision and Order dismissing the appeals. The Unions moved for reconsideration, and on June 7, 2000, the Authority denied the motion for reconsideration. The Unions then filed this petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;The proposals at issue are outside of the duty to bargain</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7117(a)(1) of Title 5 specifies that the duty to bargain in good faith extends to matters "not inconsistent with any Federal law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1). The FLRA found that the Unions' proposals are inconsistent with &#x00A7; 709(b) of the Technician Act, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b). We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsections 709(b)(2) and (3) of the Technician Act state that National Guard technicians must be members of the National Guard and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for that position, that is, the military grade specified by the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force. These two subsections were contained in &#x00A7; 202 of H.R. 2, a bill proposed "to strengthen the Reserve components of the Armed Forces, and clarify the status of National Guard technicians," as originally introduced. H.R. Rep. No. 90-13, at 1, 101-02 (1967). In Title II, which addressed the status of National Guard technicians, the bill as reported amended clause (b) of &#x00A7; 709 as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Except as prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a technician employed under subsection (a) shall, while so employed, be a member of the National Guard and hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 101-02. In the Report accompanying the original bill, the Committee <span id="page_858"></span>on Armed Services observed that "[c]lause (b) convert[ed] to a statutory requirement" that which had long been the practice of the Secretary concerned, namely "to designate certain positions as 'officer positions,' others as 'enlisted positions,' which [could] be filled only by individuals who hold the appropriate grade in the National Guard<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 58. The Committee recognized the "high correlation between the duties of the technician in his military and civilian capacities," and concluded that,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]n the interest of efficiency and discipline, a military commander should not be a civilian subordinate of a member of his unit<span class="Italic">. Such inversions may be prevented by authorizing the Secretary concerned to establish the military grade required</span> for employment in a particular technician position. Proposed 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b) of the bill <span class="Italic">would so provide</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 58-59 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Fall of 1967, the Committee on Armed Services, considering H.R. 2, agreed to defer action on the section addressing the status of National Guard technicians until the second session of the 90th Congress. Senate Comm. on Armed Services, 90th Cong. 1967-68 Legislative Calendar, at 25 (July 22, 1968). During the second session, the Committee reported S. 3865, the National Guard Technician Act of 1968. S. Rep. No. 90-1446 (1968). As with Title II of H.R. 2, a purpose of the bill was to clarify the technicians' legal status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1. Important for present purposes, &#x00A7; 709 clause (b) of S. 3865 was identical to that contained in H.R. 2<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 40-11. The Report accompanying S. 3865 expressed the firm view that "technicians who are required to be military members of the National Guard should occupy a military position which is compatible with their civilian technician position<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 20.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history underlying &#x00A7; 709(b) underscores three points. First, Congress found compatibility requirements to be essential to military "efficiency and discipline." Second, Congress intended to maintain the long-time practice of the Secretary "to designate certain positions" to "be filled only by individuals who hold the appropriate grade in the National Guard." Third, in requiring National Guard technicians to "[h]old the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned," &#x00A7; 709(b) aims, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to preserve the "high correlation between the duties of the technician in his military and civilian capacities." Because the Unions' proposals are at odds with these purposes, they are "inconsistent with [a] Federal law" and, consequently, outside the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Mont. Air Chapter</span>, 20 F.L.R.A. at 723-27 (examining legislative history of &#x00A7; 709 and reaching same result).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, under the Technician Act, it is clear that a National Guard technician "must" "hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for that position," and that this requirement includes holding a grade that is consistent with the military grade inversion policy. It also appears undisputed that the Departments of the Army and the Air Force, implementing the decision of the Secretaries, specified that there could be no grade inversion in technician Wage Leader positions: The Authority was therefore fully warranted in finding that the Unions' proposals were nonnegotiable under &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Unions point out that the Authority did not find that &#x00A7; 709(b) grants the agency unfettered discretion to determine military grades<span class="Italic">. See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100</span>, 56 F.L.R.A. at 434 n.4. They assert, additionally, that because statutes granting agencies discretion, but not unfettered discretion, are not bars to negotiation, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Admin. Med Ctr., Veterans Canteen Serv.</span>, 44 FLRA (No. 16) 162, 163-65 (1992), their proposals are not prohibited by &#x00A7; 709. This argument misses the point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Bargaining over the military grade inversion policy is <span class="Italic">inconsistent with a federal law</span>. That, by itself, makes the proposals nonnegotiable. The Authority made this absolutely clear when it held that, with regard to a matter that might otherwise be negotiable as a "condition of employment," "bargaining will nevertheless be foreclosed if a proposal is inconsistent with law." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100</span>, 55 FLRA at 1229, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 13. Further, in its order denying the motion for reconsideration, the Authority emphasized that the Unions' proposals are "outside the duty to bargain without regard to whether they are...within the sole discretion of an agency." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Texas Lone Star Chapter 100</span>, 56 FLRA at 434, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 17 (emphasis and ellipsis in original). We can find no fault with these holdings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Unions contend that the Authority's decision goes too far in suggesting that any proposal affecting the "military aspects of technician employment" is outside of the duty to bargain. There is merit in this contention, but we need not address the issue. The Authority is correct that the disputed Union proposals are "inconsistent with law" and, therefore, beyond the bounds of permissible bargaining. We deny the petition for review on this ground alone.</p>
