<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-96"><span class="space">c.</span> Zero Tolerance Policy</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Zero tolerance policies were touched on earlier in the chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-013.html#sec7-14">Off-Duty Drug Offense</a>." The Board may give little weight to an agency's zero tolerance policy leading to virtually automatic removal if the record shows a long and otherwise unblemished performance and an absence of aggravating factors. In <span class="Italic">Omites v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 223, 228-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2000), the appellant, a distribution clerk, was removed on a charge of unacceptable conduct supported by the assertion that the appellant threw a partially filled soda can against a wall and near a supervisor during a moment of anger while in conversation with the supervisor. The supervisor was neither injured nor placed in fear by the incident. The agency's response was that it had a "zero tolerance" policy concerning acts of violence. The Board mitigated removal to suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the AJ's determination that the deciding official, Postmaster Tim O'Hara, failed to appropriately consider the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors here. Both O'Hara and Hoese testified that they did not give serious consideration to a penalty other than removal. O'Hara testified that the appellant did not have the potential for rehabilitation. However, the record does not show that the appellant had engaged in this type of behavior or any other misconduct in the past. O'Hara contended that the appellant lacked rehabilitative potential because he "didn't sense that she cared whether...she [was] going to change...." But...O'Hara did not otherwise explain in either his decision letter or his hearing testimony why the appellant was not a good candidate for rehabilitation in light of this single act of misconduct, which she readily admitted before the agency and AJ, and in light of her good performance record, her lengthy federal service, and her lack of prior discipline. O'Hara merely stated that the seriousness of the offense outweighed other <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that O'Hara's failure to seriously consider a lesser penalty or the appellant's rehabilitative potential is due, in large part, to his narrow interpretation of the agency's "zero tolerance" policy. The policy, in essence, states that any violence, threats, harassment, intimidation or bullying will not be tolerated, and that management will take appropriate action when violations of the policy are reported. The policy does not state that any violation, no matter how minor or what the circumstances, will result in removal of the offending employee<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> O'Hara, however, interpreted the policy to <span class="Italic">require removal</span>. When asked to explain the zero tolerance policy, O'Hara stated "[o]h, it--the zero tolerance--just what it says, zero tolerance. If there's violence or threats of physical violence that [sic] there's no tolerance for that, and to me zero tolerance means removal." The agency's position that removal is the proper penalty for any violation of its zero tolerance policy, without real consideration by deciding official O'Hara of the relevant mitigating factors and the particular circumstances of this case, is contrary to <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1084 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Blake v. Department of Justice,</span> 81 MSPR 394 &#x00B6; 39 (1999). Further, the agency did not present any evidence of the consistency of the removal penalty for the appellant's misconduct with any relevant table of penalties. Because the agency failed to weigh the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors here, we find that the AJ correctly did not defer to the agency's penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See Toth v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 76 MSPR 36, 39-40 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A zero tolerance policy that resulted in the failure of an agency to conduct a balanced mitigation analysis was again the basis for mitigating a penalty in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 91 MSPR 60, 66-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-24 (2002), involving improper access by a supervisory tax technician to tax information concerning another individual:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ properly determined that the agency, in making its penalty determination, failed to consider and weigh several relevant factors in mitigation. Specifically, Mr. Briskie acknowledged that he could not recall considering the appellant's disciplinary history as a factor in mitigation. In addition, Mr. Briskie testified that he failed to consider any lesser penalty and erroneously concluded that the appellant's years of service constituted an aggravating, rather than mitigating factor for consideration. <span class="Italic">See Omites,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 223 &#x00B6; 11 (deciding official erroneously concluded that "zero tolerance" policy precluded consideration of mitigating factors); <span class="Italic">see also Shelly v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 677, 684 (1997) ("Under [the agency's] approach, the longer someone works, the more likely it is that single a misstep will be fatal to his or her career. We do not endorse this approach...."). In light of these errors, we need not defer to the agency's penalty determination<span class="Italic">. Stuhlmacher,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 272 &#x00B6; 20. Therefore, we review the penalty imposed in light of the considerations articulated in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> to determine whether the penalty exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Omites</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 223 &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Weighing in the appellant's favor is her 27 years of discipline-free government service, including 17 years with the IRS<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Gibb v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 135 &#x00B6; 33 (2001) (Board found 20 years of discipline-free service to be mitigating factor); <span class="Italic">Shelly,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 684 (23 years of discipline-free service mitigating factor). During her 17-year tenure with the IRS, the appellant retained almost unfettered access to IDRS tax account information and was never cited for any UNAX violation. In addition, she maintained satisfactory performance evaluations as a manager, section chief, and supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notably, the current offense was based on a single incident that lasted only a few seconds and involved one individual's tax information<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Omites,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 223 &#x00B6; 14 (appellant's "single act" does not support removal); <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305 (relevant penalty consideration is whether offense was "frequently repeated"). Further, the record suggests the appellant was cooperative throughout the agency's investigation, acknowledged the severity of the charge, and agreed that the agency had a duty to vigorously pursue any alleged IDRS breach. In our opinion, all of these considerations suggest that the appellant's prospects for rehabilitation are promising.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the record is void of any substantive evidence to demonstrate the violation was carried out maliciously or for apparent gain. Although we agree with the AJ's finding that the appellant had a "troubled relationship" with Mr. Woizesko, we are unwilling to conclude from this record that her actions qualify as malicious. On this point, the agency acknowledges in their PFR response, "we do not know [the appellant's] precise reasons" for accessing Mr. Woizesko's tax records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, with respect to the concerns expressed by Mr. Briskie relating to the public's perception of the agency, we find no evidence in the record to suggest that the appellant's misconduct resulted in any adverse publicity outside the agency or that the offense had any impact on the reputation of the agency or the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gibb,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 135 &#x00B6; 33; <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Carr,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 343 (1998), <span class="Italic">affd,</span> 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, we recognize the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct, the breach of trust that her actions represent in light of her supervisory position, and the fact that she was informed on a previous occasion that her actions had compromised IDRS security policy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stuhlmacher,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 272 &#x00B6; 11 (seriousness of offense not necessarily sufficient to outweigh other <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors); <span class="Italic">Cantu v. Department of Treasury,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 253 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (higher standard of conduct and degree of trust required for supervisor); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 371 &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (loss of trust is significant aggravating factor given nature of appellant's responsibilities). In addition, we acknowledge the clarity of notice provided to agency employees regarding UNAX violations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we acknowledge the agency's commitment to a "zero tolerance" policy for UNAX violations, we do not conclude this policy <span id="Page_2409"></span>sanctions removal for every IDRS violation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Omites</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 223 &#x00B6; 11 (agency's position that "zero tolerance" policy warrants removal without consideration of mitigating factors and circumstances of case is contrary to <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>). The fact the agency expressly considers mitigating factors in relation to the penalty imposed for an IDRS violation supports this conclusion. Further, we note that the agency's Certification of Annual UNAX Awareness Briefing form that must be signed by participating agency personnel does not mandate removal for all UNAX violations but states that a violation "<span class="Italic">can result</span> in severe penalties, including imprisonment of up to one year, a fine of up to $1000, dismissal from employment, and the costs of prosecution."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, viewing the entire record in light of the considerations articulated in <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> we find that removal is not reasonably warranted given the facts in mitigation that were ignored by the agency. We have determined that a demotion to the next lower-graded non-supervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay constitutes the maximum reasonable penalty under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stuhlmacher,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 272 &#x00B6; 31; <span class="Italic">see also Williams v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 487, 491 (1998) (appellant may be unsuitable to perform in supervisory position but record does not establish unsuitable to perform in nonsupervisory position). Further, we believe this penalty adequately addresses any agency concern related to the appellant's influence as a supervisor and find that the severity of this penalty will thoroughly deter similar conduct in the future by both the appellant and other employees. <span class="Italic">See Fowler v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 8, 14 (1997), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 135 F.3d 773 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). For these reasons, we find that the maximum reasonable penalty in this case is a demotion to the next lower graded nonsupervisory position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A zero tolerance policy, resulting in an employee's dismissal for violation of a workplace violence policy received no deference from the Board, although discharge was sustained on the Board's independent examination of the penalty, <span class="Italic">Wiley v.

Where, as here, the agency's charge is sustained, the Board will modify an agency-imposed penalty only when it finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or the penalty imposed clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Jacoby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 15 (2000). Here, the deciding official, Carl J. Iannazzo, who had been in his position for a little over 6 months when he removed the appellant, failed to appropriately consider the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Although his letter of decision and a small portion of his direct testimony indicate that he considered factors such as the seriousness of the offense, the appellant's 8 years of service, and whether there were any other mitigating factors, the majority of his hearing testimony makes it overwhelmingly clear that he did not give serious consideration to any penalty other than removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Iannazzo's position that removal is the proper penalty for any violation of the zero tolerance policy, without any real consideration of a lesser penalty, is contrary to <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See Omites v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 11 (2000).

<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, when there was evidence that the deciding official considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, what amounted to a challenge to a zero tolerance policy concerning improper access of taxpayer information by an IRS employee was not a basis to set aside the removal in <span class="Italic">McLeod v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that, in presenting its case, the agency emphasized that it has a zero tolerance policy concerning drugs in the workplace. The administrative judge determined that the deciding official testified that such a policy is provided for in the Master Labor Agreement, which contains the agency's Drug Free Workplace Program, and that, in the past, he has removed employees who brought drugs to the workplace and who were under the influence of such drugs. The administrative judge found, however, that, despite references to a zero tolerance policy, there is no evidence in the record that one exists. She determined that, nevertheless, the deciding official acted as if there was such a policy, failing to give any consideration to imposing a penalty less than removal, and giving only a cursory evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, particularly the mitigating factors. On that basis, the administrative judge determined that the agency's penalty selection was not entitled to deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's policy against drugs in the workplace is reflected in its Civilian Human Resources Manual, Subchapter 792.3, Drug-Free Workplace Program of October 2005, and is specifically referenced in the Master Labor Agreement. The policy provides that "[a]ppropriate administrative action will be taken in every instance of illegal drug use." A December 13, 2005 Memorandum for Distribution titled General Notice of Drug Testing for New Employees under Department of the Navy Drug-Free Workplace Program provides that the agency will not tolerate the use of illegal drugs and that disciplinary action up to and including removal will be initiated for the first failure to remain drug-free. In addition, the agency's Table of Penalties provides for a range in penalties from a 14-day suspension to a removal for a first offense of unlawful use, being under the influence, or possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia on or off duty. These documents do not suggest a zero tolerance policy whereby any drug violation will result in removal of the offending employee. We therefore agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency did not, in fact, have a fully documented, agency-specific zero tolerance policy.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although we need not reach the issue here, we note that Executive Order 12564 (Sept. 15, 1986), and a recent memorandum issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, "Federal Laws and Policies Prohibiting Marijuana Use," May 26, 2015, available at <a href="http://www.chcoc.gov/transmittals/TransmittalDetails.aspx?TransmittalID=6766">http://www.chcoc.gov/transmittals/TransmittalDetails.aspx?TransmittalID=6766</a>, require federal employees to refrain from the use of illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, however, the administrative judge found that, notwithstanding the lack of an agency zero tolerance policy, the deciding official nonetheless applied such a policy. After a thorough review, we find that the administrative judge's finding is not supported by the record. Appended to the removal notice issued to the appellant by the deciding official was a three-page <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis, which reflects that the deciding official carefully considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and how each one applied to the appellant's situation. The deciding official's hearing testimony was in accord; he testified that not every case of illegal drug use mandates removal, that it is necessary to look at the facts and circumstances of each case, and that he did so here. Because the deciding official weighed the relevant factors in arriving at the penalty of removal, <span id="Page_2410"></span>we find, under these circumstances, that the administrative judge erred by failing to afford the agency's penalty determination deference. <span class="Italic">See Ellis v. Department of Defense</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 11 (2010) (stating that, where all of an agency's charges have been sustained, the Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all of the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness); <span class="Italic">Harris v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 613, &#x00B6; 13 (2005) (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Zero tolerance is not the same as low tolerance for employee misconduct, <span class="Italic">Altamirano v. CSHIB,</span> DE-0752-10-0127-I-2 (NP 6/1/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we do not agree with the appellant's assertion that the agency applied a zero tolerance policy to him. The record reflects that the deciding official considered all of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in his decision to effect the appellant's removal. There is no evidence that the agency had a zero tolerance policy or applied it to the appellant. The deciding official's testimony regarding the agency's low tolerance for the appellant's misconduct does not persuade us of the existence or application of a zero tolerance policy; rather, it is clear that the deciding official considered the severity and frequency of the appellant's misconduct to determine the appropriate penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are some situations that may leave a deciding official no choice in a penalty, e.g., a removal based on loss of a necessary security clearance, and then the official's failure to consider <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors is legally immaterial. <span class="Italic">See Blagaich v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 90 MSPR 619, 625 &#x00B6; 16 (2001) (Board was only permitted to consider whether the agency had a formal policy requiring reassignment and, if so, whether a position existed for a reassignment). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-079.html#sec8-79">Security Clearance Revocation; Sensitive Position</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-15-063.html#sec8-64">License, Certification</a>," for terminations resulting from loss of security clearances or other certifications necessary to perform a position.]</p>
