<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-342"><span class="space">c.</span> Deductions From Back Pay for Interim Earnings</h5>
<p class="noindent">Interim earnings offsets were evaluated as to overtime work and moonlighting positions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin Compliance Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 247</span>, 44 FLRA 1306, 1317-24 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 45 FLRA 525 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Overtime Earnings</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, provides in part that an employee who is entitled to backpay shall receive:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1607"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i). The regulations implementing the Back Pay Act provide in part that in computing the amount of backpay under the Back Pay Act and the regulations, an agency shall deduct "[a]ny amounts earned by an employee from other employment during the period covered by the corrective action...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(1). The regulations also provide that "[t]he agency shall include as other employment only employment engaged in by the employee to take the place of employment from which the employee has been separated by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the employee was scheduled to work 40 hours a week at his interim job at Circle-K and that he worked overtime there as well. The record also shows that the employee had worked 40 hours a week for the Respondent and would not have worked overtime for the Respondent. In determining the amount of backpay owed to the employee, the Respondent deducted all of the employee's Circle-K earnings, including overtime earnings, from the employee's gross backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the Back Pay Act nor its implementing regulations specifically address whether or to what extent overtime earnings from interim employment may be deducted from an employee's backpay award. However, as noted by the Judge, it is "arguable" that "overtime earned in 'other employment,' where no overtime had been worked by [the employee] in his government employment, should not be deducted...." Although the Authority has not addressed this issue, the issue has been addressed by the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB has held that, under the Back Pay Act, "overtime earned during a period of wrongful removal <span class="Italic">in excess</span> of that which would have been earned in the desired job should not be offset" against the backpay award<span class="Italic">. Blackmer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 624, 630 (1991) (emphasis in original) (<span class="Italic">Blackmer</span>). Where overtime is not part of an employee's agency job, the MSPB has stated that the agency may "deduct[&#8197;] from back pay as a result of earnings from other employment...only such sums as [the employee] may have earned during a regular forty-hour week" and not additional money earned as overtime. <span class="Italic">Phelps v. Department of Labor</span>, 35 MSPR 273, 277 (1977) (<span class="Italic">Phelps</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Payne v. Panama Canal Co.</span>, 428 F. Supp. 997, 1001 (D.C. Canal Zone 1977), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 607 F.2d 155 (5th Cir. 1979) (<span class="Italic">Payne</span>)). In reaching this conclusion, the MSPB noted that, consistent with the reasoning of the NLRB in private sector cases, to allow an employer to offset excess overtime earnings "would create the anomaly whereby an assiduous and diligent backpay claimant would be penalized for toiling a long day while the shirker would be rewarded." <span class="Italic">Phelps</span>, 35 MSPR at 276 (citing <span class="Italic">United Aircraft Corp.</span>, 204 NLRB 1068, 1073 (1973)). The MSPB reasoned that allowing an employee to retain "earnings from excess overtime does not make [an employee] more than 'whole'"; rather, the additional income is the result of the [employee's] extra effort. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Master Transmission Rebuilders, Inc.</span>, 269 NLRB 93, 94 (1984), and <span class="Italic">Southeastern Envelope Co.</span>, 246 NLRB 423, 424 n.10 (1979)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the above-noted reasoning, we find that under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, an agency may deduct from an award of backpay the amount that the employee earned in interim employment during a regular workweek and the amount of overtime earned to the extent that the employee would have worked that amount of overtime in the agency job. If the employee would not have worked overtime in the agency job or would have worked less overtime in the agency job, the agency may not deduct from the employee's backpay award the excess amount of interim overtime wages that the employee earned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blackmer</span> and <span class="Italic">Phelps</span>. This reasoning is further supported by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2), which provides that an agency may deduct from gross backpay "only [earnings from] employment engaged in by the employee to take the place of employment from which the employee has been separated by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action[.]" Overtime hours in excess of what an employee would have worked for the agency do not "take the place of" the desired agency job. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that FPM Supp.&#x2003;990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c requires the Respondent to deduct all interim earnings from the backpay award unless those earnings were from outside employment which the employee had engaged in before the unjustified absence occurred. In view of this finding and of early Comptroller General decisions consistent with this finding, the Judge concluded that decisions of the courts and the NLRB with respect to the private sector, as well as decisions of the MSPB and the courts under the Back Pay Act, were "immaterial[.]" The Judge further found that the Union and the General Counsel improperly relied on an advisory opinion of the General Counsel of the GAO's Comptroller General and that the MSPB [in <span class="Italic">Phelps</span>] has miscited the advisory opinion (B-224073, Mar. 17, 1987). The Judge concluded that the Respondent had acted "fully in accord with" the Back Pay Act, the implementing regulations, the FPM, and the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We noted above that we would apply the same reasoning used by the MSPB to determine whether an agency may deduct overtime earnings from interim employment from an employee's backpay award. To the extent that the Judge found that the MSPB improperly relied on an advisory opinion from the GAO's Office of the General Counsel, we disagree. The GAO General Counsel issued that opinion, B-224073 (Mar. 17, 1987), in response to a request from the MSPB to reexamine Comptroller General precedent on deducting outside overtime from backpay awards. The opinion from the GAO's Office of the General Counsel analyzes the recent public and private sector precedent on the issue and states with approval the underlying policy behind that precedent. The opinion notes the conflicting Comptroller General precedent but states that "it is not clear if the same result would be reached today, particularly in light of contrary precedent in other forums." B-224073 at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB had requested the opinion from the GAO's Office of the General Counsel in relation to the MSPB's decision in <span class="Italic">Phelps</span>. In <span class="Italic">Phelps</span>, the MSPB adopted the reasoning of the opinion of the GAO General Counsel, including the reasoning of private sector precedent discussed in that opinion. In these circumstances, we reject the Judge's finding that the MSPB improperly relied on the opinion. Moreover, the Office of the General Counsel of the GAO continues to follow the reasoning of the opinion. In B-233954 (Jan. 24, 1989), the Office of the General Counsel of the GAO states in an opinion to the U.S. Department of Justice that the courts, the NLRB, and the MSPB have adopted a "more liberal approach" than older Comptroller General cases and "have limited deductions from backpay to only such salary as the [employee] may have earned during a 40-hour week." B-233954 at 1. Further, we note that while the Judge and the Respondent rely on the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Matter of Kido</span> to support their positions, their reliance is misplaced as there was no allegation in that case that the employee had worked overtime in her interim employment. Nothing in the 1987 or 1989 opinions from the Office of the General Counsel of the GAO indicates that the GAO, if presented with a case involving a similar situation, would not apply the reasoning of those opinions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the Judge found that FPM Supp.&#x2003;990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c requires the Respondent to deduct all of the employee's interim overtime earnings. However, the portion of FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c relied on by the Judge addresses the extent to which an agency may set off wages from gross backpay when those wages were earned in a part-time job that the employee held prior to the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action or when those wages were earned in a second part-time job taken as a substitute for Government employment. This subchapter of the FPM makes no mention of interim overtime wages. Accordingly, we find that the portion of FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c relied on by the Judge does not apply to interim overtime wages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, consistent with the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, an agency may not deduct from gross backpay the excess amount of interim overtime wages that the employee earned. This position is consistent with the policy of private sector case law that an employer should deduct wages earned only from employment engaged in to take the place of the desired job and not wages earned as a result of an employee's extra effort. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EDP Medical Computer Systems, Inc.</span>, 293 NLRB 857, 858 (1989) (the employee's backpay award was offset by only the first 32 hours of her weekly interim earnings because the employee "only worked a 32-hour week at the [r]espondent").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted previously, the arbitration award granted the employee backpay that he was entitled to receive under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations. As the employee in this case worked overtime for Circle-K and would not have worked overtime for the Respondent, we conclude that, under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, the Respondent should not have deducted any overtime earnings--in this case, interim earnings over 40 hours a week--from the employee's backpay award....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">"Moonlighting" Earnings</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that in addition to working full-time for Circle-K, the employee also worked in a "moonlighting" position at a Wal-Mart store. The employee testified at the hearing that he did not take his position at Wal-Mart to replace his Agency job. As found by the Judge, the Respondent deducted the employee's earnings from the employee's "work outside the hours of his government duty hours, i.e., a second, or 'moonlighting,' job which he could have held simultaneously with his government job." As no exceptions were filed to the Judge's finding, we adopt the Judge's finding that the employee could have held the Wal-Mart job simultaneously with his Agency job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted previously, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2), an agency may deduct from gross backpay "only [earnings from] employment engaged in by the employee to take the place of employment from which the employee has been separated by the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action[.]" Similar to the rule with respect to interim overtime earnings, we find that where an employee works an additional ("moonlighting") job during the backpay period, earnings from the <span id="page_1608"></span>"moonlighting" job do not "take the place of" agency earnings within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2) to the extent that the employee could have held the "moonlighting" job while working for the agency. Therefore, like excess overtime, those earnings from a "moonlighting" job may not be deducted from the backpay award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Payne</span>, 428 F. Supp. at 1001 (under the Back Pay Act, "[e]xtra employment that [the employee] may have obtained 'moonlighting' at nights or on weekends in order to survive should not be deductible" from the backpay award). However, moonlighting wages which could not have been earned simultaneously with the agency job are properly considered earnings from employment designed to take the place of the agency job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Broadnax v. United States Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 219, 228 (1987) ("where the 'moonlighting' job could not have been held if the employee had obtained or remained in the position at issue, such earnings constitute interim earnings and must be deducted from the award").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these principles to this case, we find that the employee's Wal-Mart wages should not have been deducted from gross backpay because those wages were "moonlighting" wages which the employee could have earned simultaneously with his Agency job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge relied on the FPM and decisions of the Comptroller General in concluding that the Respondent properly deducted all of the employee's earnings from his "moonlighting" job at Wal-Mart. With respect to the FPM, the Judge noted that "in clear and unambiguous language[,]" FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c(1), provides that "<span class="Italic">all earnings from outside employment be deducted except earnings the employee already had prior to the separation</span>." As the employee had no outside employment prior to his separation, the Judge concluded that "<span class="Italic">the FPM required that the Respondent deduct all of his outside earnings</span>," including his "moonlighting" earnings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Judge's interpretation of the FPM. The cited portion of the FPM addresses the circumstances under which an employee's outside part-time employment may be deducted from gross backpay. The FPM provides that a part-time job held prior to the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action does not "take the place of the Government employment." FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c(1) (paragraph 2). The FPM further provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the employee was able to expand the part-time job to a full-time job, or took a second part-time job, as a substitute for Government employment, only those hours worked on the full-time job in excess of the aggregate of the part-time job, or only the hours worked on the second job...are considered as other employment in place of Government employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Following this explanation, the FPM states: "In other words, the only earnings from other employment that may <span class="Italic">not</span> be deducted from backpay are earnings from outside employment the employee already had before the unjustified suspension or separation." FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c(1) (paragraph 3) (emphasis in original). This statement must be read in context with the remainder of that section of the FPM as well as with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e). When read in context, it is evident that the section of the FPM concerning set-offs for second part-time jobs applies only to a job that was designed to "take the place of" or that was "a substitute for Government employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2); FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c(1) (paragraph 2). Wages from a "moonlighting" job do not "take the place of" or "act as a substitute for" the agency job to the extent that the employee could have earned such wages simultaneously with the agency job. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, the cited section of the FPM does not apply to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Comptroller General, the Judge and the Respondent cite <span class="Italic">Matter of Kido</span> as support for their positions. However, there was no allegation in that Comptroller General decision that the employee had worked in a "moonlighting" job or that the agency had improperly deducted any "moonlighting" earnings from the backpay award. Accordingly, that decision does not apply to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, as we noted previously, we find that an agency may not deduct "moonlighting" earnings from gross backpay to the extent that the employee could have held the "moonlighting' job while working for the agency. This rule is consistent with the rule applied by courts and the NLRB in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. State of New Jersey</span>, 530 F. Supp. 328, 336 (D.N.J. 1981) ("'Moonlighting' earnings of the [employee] may be used to offset back pay only to the extent that the employer can show that the [employee] would not have been able to work the second job, if he had in fact been hired by the employer."); <span class="Italic">Teamsters Local 559</span>, 257 NLRB 24, 25 (1981) (earnings from a "moonlighting" job held during hours that an employee would not have worked for the employer are not deducted from backpay).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as the employee in this case worked in a "moonlighting" job for Wal-Mart which he could have held while working for the Respondent, we conclude that, under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, the Respondent should not have deducted the employee's earnings from his Wal-Mart job. Having found that the Respondent's actions were inconsistent with the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, we find that the Respondent disregarded the backpay portion of the arbitration award and thereby failed to comply with the award in violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute....</p>
