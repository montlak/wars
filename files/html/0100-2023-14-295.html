<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-296"><span class="space">3.</span> Allowance; Uniform Maintenance</h4>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 5901 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;There is authorized to be appropriated annually to each agency of the Government of the United States, including a Government owned corporation, and of the government of the District of Columbia, on a showing of necessity or desirability, such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subchapter. The head of the agency concerned, out of funds made available by the appropriation, shall--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;furnish to each of these employees a uniform at a cost not to exceed $400 a year (or such higher maximum amount as the Office of Personnel Management may establish under section 5902); or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;pay to each of these employees an allowance for a uniform not to exceed $400 a year (or such higher maximum amount as the Office of Personnel Management may establish under section 5902).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The allowance may be paid only at the times and in the amounts authorized by the regulations prescribed under section 5903 of this title.&#x2003;When the agency pays direct to the uniform vendor, the head of the agency may deduct a service charge of not more than 4 percent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;When the furnishing of a uniform or the payment of a uniform allowance is authorized under another statute or regulation existing on September 1, 1954, the head of the agency concerned may continue <span id="page_837"></span>the furnishing of the uniform or the payment of the uniform allowance under that statute or regulation, but in that event a uniform may not be furnished or allowance paid under this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;An allowance paid under this section is not wages within the meaning of section 409 of title 42 or chapters 21 and 24 of title 26.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 5902:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management may, from time to time, by regulation adjust the maximum amount for the cost of uniforms and the maximum allowance for uniforms under section 5901.</p>
<p class="noindent">Implementing OPM regulations, 5 CFR Part 591 (2022), establish government-wide uniform allowances:</p>

A "uniform" does not include protective equipment required for the employee's safety under 5 U.S.C. 7903 or normal business or work attire purchased at the discretion of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Year </span>means any period of 12 consecutive months designated by an agency as the basis for applying the maximum uniform allowance rates established under this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">591.103 <span class="Italic">Governmentwide maximum uniform allowance rate.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate is payable under &#x00A7; 591.104 to an employee who is required by statute, regulation, or an agency's written administrative procedures to wear a uniform, the head of each agency concerned, out of funds available, shall--</p>

<p class="noindent">Interpreting the OPM regulation in a case reviewing exceptions to an arbitration award declining to honor nonnegotiated requirements of an agency concerning uniform cost, FLRA explained the discretion of the agency under the regulation, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, NAS Pensacola and AFGE Local 1960</span>, 65 FLRA 1004, 1007-08 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, Section 591.103(c)'s plain language requires an agency to "establish policies to administer the [agency's] uniform allowance program[.]" <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1709</span>, 57 FLRA 453, 455 (2001) (relying on plain language to resolve a matter of statutory interpretation). However, contrary to the Agency's argument, &#x00A7; 591.103(c)'s plain language does not require employees to provide evidence of their uniform purchases for the Agency's use in determining their annual uniform allowance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Agency contends that contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 591.103(c), the Arbitrator erroneously determined that employees' self-certifications of their uniform purchases may not be utilized to determine the uniform allowance. However, the plain language of &#x00A7; 591.103(c), set forth above, also does not include such a requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, to the extent the Agency relies on the preamble to &#x00A7; 591.103(c), as published in the Federal Register, to argue that the award is contrary to the regulation, the Agency's reliance is misplaced. The Agency relies on the preamble to argue that, under &#x00A7; 591.103(c), employees are required to provide the Agency with evidence of their uniform purchases, and that the Agency has sole discretion to decide what evidence is acceptable. However, as with &#x00A7; 591.103(c)'s plain language, the language of the preamble does not address the particular evidence of their uniform purchases that employees may be to determine the annual uniform allowance. In sum, &#x00A7; 591.103(c) neither sets forth any evidentiary requirements employees must meet in connection with the determination of their annual uniform allowances, nor requires employees to submit self-certifications of their uniform purchases.</p>

However, in <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1669</span>, 55 FLRA 63 (1999), the Authority stated that, to the extent previous decisions such as <span class="Italic">ACT </span>"suggest that the comprehensive nature of [the uniform statute], by itself, forecloses any bargaining on the subject of uniform allowances, they are superseded...and will not be followed." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 67. Rather, the Authority stated that it will "explicitly analyz[e] whether the governing statute leaves any discretion to the agency[,]" and, if an agency has any discretion, then that discretion is subject to being exercised through negotiation, and the matter is not specifically provided for by Federal statute. <span class="Italic">IAMAW</span>, 50 FLRA at 682, 685.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both of the statutory provisions at issue here authorize agencies to either provide employees with uniforms, or pay them uniform allowances. The statutes also state that the cost of each uniform provided, or allowance paid, is not to exceed a stated maximum. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901; 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593. Other than its citation to <span class="Italic">ACT </span>and <span class="Italic">Locals R12</span>, the Agency does not explain how Section 1593 and the uniform statute "specifically provide[ ] for" the provision of uniform laundering services by agencies. <span class="Italic">See </span>SOP at 13 (citing <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, 26 FLRA at 683; <span class="Italic">Locals R-12</span>, 38 FLRA at 305-06). Although these statutes set limitations on the amount of funds expended per employee on a uniform or uniform allowance, the Agency does not assert that Proposal 6 would require the Agency to exceed these statutory maximums. In any event, the Authority has held that where, as here, the proposal does not prescribe a particular amount to be expended, "[t]he [uniform statute's] maximum allows the parties considerable latitude for bargaining and...it would best effectuate the Statute to permit them to explore possibilities for agreement within the statutory maximum." <span class="Italic">Council 214</span>, 30 FLRA at 1034. In sum, the Agency has not established that Section 1593 and the uniform statute "leave[ ] <span class="Italic">no </span>discretion to the Agency" to bargain over the provision of cleaning services for uniforms. <span class="Italic">See IAMAW</span>, 50 FLRA at 682 (emphasis added). Thus, we find that Proposal 6 does not pertain to a matter that is specifically provided for by Federal statute within the meaning of Subsection c:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 6 is not inconsistent with law. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1593 authorizes certain agencies to pay a uniform allowance to each civilian employee of DOD who is required to wear a uniform or, "<span class="Italic">[i]</span> <span class="Italic">n lieu of </span>providing an allowance[,]" to provide a uniform. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593(a)(1)-(2) (emphasis added). Similarly, the uniform statute states that an agency using appropriated funds shall "furnish to each...employee[ ] a uniform...<span class="Italic">or</span>...pay to each...employee[ ] an allowance for a uniform[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a) (emphasis added). Thus, under both statutes, an agency using appropriated funds may not provide an employee <span class="Italic">both </span>a uniform and a uniform allowance. Consistent with this wording, the Authority has held that a proposal that an agency pay employees a uniform allowance <span class="Italic">in addition to </span>providing a uniform was outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Council 214</span>, 30 FLRA at 1036.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the proposal merely states that the Agency "will provide cleaning services for the uniform." Neither <span class="Italic">Council 214</span>, nor the statutory provisions cited by the Agency, establishes that providing uniform cleaning services is the equivalent of providing a uniform. In this regard, Proposal 6 does not implicate the statutory prohibition against an employee receiving the dual benefit of both a uniform and a uniform allowance, notwithstanding the Agency's argument that the proposal requires it to "provid[e]...uniforms in the form of cleaning services." Moreover, as discussed above, the Agency does not argue that providing uniform cleaning services in addition to providing each employee with either a uniform or a uniform allowance would cost more than the applicable statutory maximums. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 6 is not inconsistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent">On judicial review in the Air Force uniform cleaning case, the court recited legislative intent that funds not be spent in the manner proposed by the union, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 648 F.3d 841, 842-48 (D.C. Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force petitions for review of the decision and order of the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") that a union proposal for uniform cleaning is a negotiable condition of employment. Reversing its position before the FLRA, the Air Force contends that the proposal is non-negotiable because it would require the use of appropriated funds for a purpose not authorized by law. Section 1593 of title 10 of the U.S. Code authorizes certain appropriated funds to be used "for uniforms...or for allowance for uniforms," whereby the Air Force may either "pay an allowance" to employees required by law "to wear a prescribed uniform" or, "[i]n lieu of providing an allowance...[,] provide a uniform" to employees. <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a). Based on a recently discovered Conference Report, the Air Force contends that neither alternative authorizes the expenditure of funds for the provision of services related to uniforms and statutory silence does not leave it discretion to do so. The FLRA, invoking the waiver provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c), contends the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the petition because the Air Force failed to present its new interpretation of the uniform statutes below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that the Air Force's belated discovery of a constitutional appropriations bar, <span class="Italic">see</span> U.S. Const. art. I, &#x00A7; 9, cl. 7, is an "extraordinary circumstance[ ]" under section 7123(c) that permits consideration of an argument not presented to the FLRA. Were the exception not to apply, the FLRA's order would, in effect, permit the Air Force, by contract with the Union, to authorize the expenditure of funds beyond what Congress has approved. Having jurisdiction, we grant the petition. Whether because the plain text of the uniform statutes does not authorize use of funds for cleaning uniforms, or because the statutory silence creates ambiguity and the FLRA must defer to the permissible interpretation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593 by the Department of Defense, which administers the statute, the Air Force has no duty to bargain over uniform cleaning services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As of August 2007, the Air Force requires its Air Reserve Technicians, who are citizen-employees required as a condition of their employment to maintain membership in a military reserve unit, to "wear the military uniform while performing civilian duties." Air Force Instruction 36-801 &#x00A7; 1.1.1.9 (Apr. 29, 1994) (incorporating change Aug. 6, 2007). The National Association of Independent Labor, Local 7 ("the Union"), challenged the "compelling need" for the uniform requirement, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.50, and alternatively proposed as a subject for negotiation that the Air Force provide uniform cleaning services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force claimed it had no duty to bargain over uniform maintenance because "[t]his matter is specifically provided for by federal statute and therefore is not a condition of employment under 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 7103(a)(14)." In its view, "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901 addresse[d] the payment of a uniform allowance for the maintenance of the uniform." When the Union filed a petition for a review of negotiability issues with the FLRA, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.22, the Air Force responded to the same effect, stating that the uniform maintenance proposal was non-negotiable because under FLRA precedents uniform cleaning expenses were expressly provided for in 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593 and thus fell outside the duty to bargain. Alternatively, it argued that the proposal was inconsistent with 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593, which authorized the Air Force either to furnish a uniform or to provide a uniform allowance, but not to "pay a uniform allowance [and] also to furnish uniforms in the form of cleaning services to those employees who also receive a uniform allowance." The Union responded by pointing to more recent FLRA precedents as supporting the negotiability of the uniform cleaning proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA agreed with the Union, ruling the Air Force had not established that the uniform statutes left it no discretion to bargain where the <span id="page_839"></span>uniform cleaning proposal would not require it to exceed the dollar amount of the uniform allowance, and further that the proposal was not inconsistent with the uniform statutes because providing cleaning services was not the equivalent of furnishing a uniform. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Ass'n of Indep. Labor Local 7, </span>64 F.L.R.A. 1194, 1199-1200 (2010). The Air Force petitions for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c), "[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Authority...shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances." The petition for review by the Air Force presents a new interpretation of the uniform statutes, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901, based on a belatedly discovered Conference Report that, in its view, precludes payment for cleaning services. Unless the Air Force's petition falls within the "extraordinary circumstances" exception to the waiver provision, then, the court must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court, recognizing its jurisdiction normally does not extend to an "objection that has not been urged before the Authority," <span class="Italic">Am.

Cir. 2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted), has interpreted the "extraordinary circumstances" exception narrowly. The Supreme Court held that the "plain language [of section 7123(c)] evinces an intent that the FLRA shall pass upon issues arising under [Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, known as the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.], thereby bringing its expertise to bear on the resolution of those issues." <span class="Italic">EEOC v.

In that case, the Court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to decide the question of negotiability because the principal arguments advanced by the EEOC against negotiability were not presented to the FLRA, and there was no extraordinary circumstance to excuse the omission. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 23-24. "[T]he Court so held despite the fact that, had EEOC's contentions been correct, the FLRA decision would have undercut congressional policy." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev. v. FLRA, </span>964 F.2d 1, 4, 296 U.S. App. D.C. 1 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Accordingly, this court concluded that it is not enough that the FLRA's order would arguably circumvent this court's precedent or even a congressional preference with regard to a class of employees. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 3-4. Instead, in an exemplary circumstance, the court has applied the "extraordinary circumstances" exception to reach arguments not presented to the FLRA where they "simply track the objections considered by the [FLRA]" in another case. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Interior Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA, </span>969 F.2d 1158, 1161, 297 U.S. App. D.C. 158 (D.C. Cir. 1992). In other words, a failure to present arguments to the FLRA was excused because the court enjoyed the benefit of the FLRA's expertise in addressing the same arguments in another case and "a rehearing petition would have been futile given that the Authority had just found an identical proposal negotiable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force suggests that FLRA precedent gave it "ample reason" to conclude that presenting its new argument to the FLRA would have been futile. It points to <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, SEIU, AFL-CIO, </span>26 F.L.R.A. 515, 526 (1987), where the FLRA, based on an examination of the uniform statutes and Senate Report No. 83-1992 (1954), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3816, 3826, concluded that 5 U.S.C. chapter 59, subchapter I (where section 5901 is found) "deals comprehensively with the payment of a uniform allowance by an agency for the maintenance of the uniform which the agency requires employees to wear." <span class="Italic">See also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Wisconsin Chapter,</span> 26 F.L.R.A. 682, 684 (1987). Subsequent FLRA decisions addressing uniform maintenance proposals emphasized and relied almost exclusively on the Senate Report in ruling that "the legislative scheme encompassed both the purchase and upkeep of the uniforms." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union, </span>46 F.L.R.A. 696, 776-77 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The difficulty with the Air Force's futility argument is two-fold. First, the legislative history objections now presented do not "simply track the objections considered by the Authority" in another case. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Interior,</span> 969 F.2d at 1161. Second, the Air Force presumes that the FLRA, having relied on legislative history in the past, would have resisted considering legislative history not previously addressed in an opinion. The futility exception does not reach that far. <span class="Italic">See Ga. State Chapter Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA, </span>184 F.3d 889, 892, 337 U.S. App. D.C. 309 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">cf. W &#x0026; M Props. of Conn., Inc. v. NLRB,</span> 514 F.3d 1341, 1346, 379 U.S. App. D.C. 432 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Particularly in the instant case, by the mid-1990s the FLRA had modified its approach to determining the negotiability of proposals, "clarif[ying]...that the comprehensiveness of a statutory scheme is not, in itself, a sufficient basis to find a matter outside the duty to bargain" and focusing instead on "whether the statute at issue provides the Agency the discretion to agree to the proposal." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps., Local 1669, </span>55 F.L.R.A. 63, 67 (1999). Consequently, the FLRA held the decisions upon which the Air Force relies in making its futility argument to be "superseded by, and inconsistent with," the new methodology insofar as the decisions "suggest that the comprehensive nature of [the uniform statute]"--a conclusion previously supported by Senate Report No. 83-1992, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., SEIU, </span>26 F.L.R.A. at 526--"by itself...foreclose[d] any bargaining on the subject of uniform allowances." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps., Local 1669, </span>55 F.L.R.A. at 67.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The belated discovery of a statutory provision, and presumably no less legislative history, would normally be insufficient to fall within the waiver exception. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Griffiss Air Force Base v. FLRA,</span> 949 F.2d 1169, 1175, 292 U.S. App. D.C. 313 (D.C. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">see also Marine Mammal Conservancy, Inc. v. Dep't of Agric., </span>134 F.3d 409, 414, 328 U.S. App. D.C. 253 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Nonetheless, we conclude that the Air Force's petition presents an "extraordinary circumstance[ ]" under section 7123(c) for another reason. The Air Force maintains, in view of the belated discovery of the Conference Report, that the uniform statutes it administers do not authorize use of appropriated funds to clean uniforms. Its new interpretation thus implicates the Constitution's Appropriations Clause, which provides that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." U.S. Const. art. I, &#x00A7; 9, cl. 7; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a); <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter v.

Richmond, </span>496 U.S. 414, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 110 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1990), the Supreme Court rejected an estoppel claim for payment of disability benefits, holding that the Appropriations Clause dictated that "judicial use of the equitable doctrine of estoppel cannot grant respondent a money remedy that Congress has not authorized." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 426. The Court pointed to the underlying separation of powers concerns: "If agents of the Executive were able, by their unauthorized oral or written statements to citizens, to obligate the Treasury for the payment of funds, the control over public funds that the Clause reposes in Congress in effect could be transferred to the Executive." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 428; <span class="Italic">cf. Schism v. United States,</span> 316 F.3d 1259, 1274-75 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Army v. FLRA, </span>56 F.3d 273, 275, 312 U.S. App. D.C. 309 (D.C. Cir. 1995), this court declined to apply section 7123(c)'s waiver provision where the petition was based on sovereign immunity, reasoning that if section 7123(c) could bar a belated claim "a federal official could effectively waive sovereign immunity and confer jurisdiction upon the court without an express authorization from the Congress."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force's petition presents the same concerns identified in <span class="Italic">Richmond</span>: were the "extraordinary circumstances" exception not to apply, the FLRA's order would, in effect, permit the Air Force, by contract with the Union, to authorize the expenditure of funds beyond what Congress has approved, <span class="Italic">see</span> 496 U.S. at 426, implicating separation of powers concerns, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 428. This follows because, contrary to the FLRA's response to the petition for review, either the plain text of the uniform statutes dictates this result or the Air Force's interpretation of any statutory ambiguity is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gen. Servs. Admin. v. FLRA,</span> 86 F.3d 1185, 1187, 318 U.S. App. D.C. 191 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Although this touches on the merits, doing so is necessary in order to determine whether the Air Force's invocation of a constitutional appropriations bar presents a substantial objection to which the waiver exception should apply. Otherwise the exception Congress provided for "extraordinary circumstances" would sweep too broadly, encompassing even frivolous Appropriations Clause challenges. This is how the court has previously ensured itself of the merits of a claim of "extraordinary circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Army, </span>56 F.3d at 275. There is no issue of the FLRA's expertise. Rather, as the Air Force suggests, "[w]aiver is not a constitutionally valid basis on which to compel the Air Force to spend funds for a purpose unauthorized by Congress." Section 7123(c), rooted in concerns of agency autonomy and judicial efficiency,<span class="Italic"> cf. Woodford v. Ngo, </span>548 U.S. 81, 89, 126 S. Ct. 2378, 165 L. Ed. 2d 368 (2006); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Saint-Gobain Abrasives, Inc., </span>426 F.3d 455, 458-59 (1st Cir. 2005), cannot create that authorization. Because the Air Force's belated discovery of a constitutional appropriations bar is an "extraordinary circumstance[ ]" under section 7123(c), the court has jurisdiction to consider the Air Force's petition, to which we now turn.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of identifying our standard of review, the court has differentiated between the FLRA's interpretations of its organic statute and interpretations of a non-organic statute, where both are at issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Tony Kempenich Mem'l Chapter 21 v. FLRA,</span> 269 F.3d 1119, 1121, 348 U.S. App. D.C. 119 (D.C. Cir. 2001). The court has held that it "owe[s] no deference to the FLRA's statutory interpretation where it has endeavored to 'reconcile its organic statute...with a[nother] statute...not within its area of expertise.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs v. FLRA, </span>9 F.3d 123, 126 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). Here, the Air Force does not challenge the FLRA's interpretation of its organic statute and thus presents no occasion to afford the FLRA deference; the Air Force does not contest the FLRA's methodology of determining when a bargaining proposal is "specifically provided for by Federal statute," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), viz., "whether the statute at issue provides the Agency the discretion to agree to the proposal," <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps., Local 1669,</span> 55 F.L.R.A. at 67. Instead, the Air Force challenges the FLRA's failure to defer to its interpretation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901, which are not administered by the FLRA. The court reviews <span id="page_840"></span><span class="Italic">de novo</span> the FLRA's interpretation of a statute it is not charged with administering. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tony Kempenich Mem'l, </span>269 F.3d at 1121.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901 relate to the provision of uniforms in that they authorize the expenditure of appropriated funds for either a uniform or "in lieu [there]of" a uniform allowance. Section 1593 is specific to the Armed Forces; section 5901 applies generally to federal government organizations and employees. Before the FLRA, the Air Force agreed with the FLRA that uniform cleaning expenses fell within the scope of these statutes, and therefore the FLRA decision addressed only whether the statutes leave any discretion to the Air Force to bargain. The FLRA ultimately concluded, because the Union proposal did not require an annual expenditure in excess of the $400 maximum allowance and was not otherwise inconsistent with the uniform statutes, that the Air Force had discretion to bargain over the amount of uniform cleaning expenses. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Ass'n of Indep. Labor Local 7,</span> 64 F.L.R.A. at 1199-1200. The Air Force now relies on a recently discovered Conference Report in contending that the uniform statutes preclude expenditures for uniform cleaning services. We apply the two-step analysis of <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, </span>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain text of the two uniform statutes addresses payment for a uniform or payment "[i]n lieu of," 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593(a)(2), provision of a uniform. The most natural reading of the text allows the expenditure of up to $400 per employee per year for uniforms, and suggests that Congress cares not whether the employer or employee is the ultimate purchaser. <span class="Italic">See FCC v. AT&#x0026;T, Inc.,</span> 131 S. Ct. 1177, 1182, 179 L. Ed. 2d 132 (2011). Neither the word "provide," 10 U.S.C. 1593(a)(2), nor "furnish," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a)(1), normally brings to mind cleaning services. That Congress did not contemplate uniform maintenance to fall within the ambit of the statutory authorization appears clear from the use of the phrase "[i]n lieu of," contrasting a uniform allowance and the provision of a uniform. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593(a)(1) &#x0026; (2). The legislative history and other traditional tools of statutory construction reinforce this conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Chevron, </span>467 U.S. at 843 n.9; <span class="Italic">Shays v. FEC,</span> 414 F.3d 76, 105, 367 U.S. App. D.C. 185 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The original Federal Employees Uniform Allowance Act of 1954, the uncodified precursor to section 5901, stated that funds may be used either to furnish a uniform or to pay "an allowance for defraying the expenses of <span class="Italic">acquisition</span> of such uniform." Pub. L. No. 83-763, &#x00A7; 402, 68 Stat. 1105, 1114 (emphasis added). Review of the legislative history further reveals that initial versions of the House and Senate bills provided for uniform maintenance. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 83-1992 (accompanying H.R. 2263 and reprinting comments on S. 2265 and S. 3507), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3826 (summarizing H.R. 2263, substantially the same as S. 2665 and S. 3681, as authorizing disbursement "for purchase and upkeep of uniforms"). The Conference Report upon which the Air Force relies states, however, that this provision was deleted: "The conference substitute adopts the language of the Senate amendment [to Title IV of H.R. 2263], except...for deletion of a provision therein for use of uniform allowances for upkeep of uniforms." Conf. Rep. No. 83-2665 (1954), <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3861, 3875.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Conference Report does not explain why the provision on upkeep of uniforms was deleted,[4] the FLRA owes deference to the Department of Defense's reasonable interpretation of the second uniform statute, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593, because the Department administers that statute, <span class="Italic">see Gen. Servs. Admin.,</span> 86 F.3d at 1187, and would exceed its authority by ruling that, in the absence of a provision specifically addressing the maintenance of uniforms, the Air Force has discretion to negotiate with the Union on uniform cleaning services, <span class="Italic">see Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps., Local 1669, </span>55 F.L.R.A. at 67. Here the Air Force's interpretation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593 (which is, of course, the same as the interpretation of the Department of Defense), assuming there is ambiguity from statutory silence, is a permissible one that this court "should not disturb" because "it appears from the statute [and] its legislative history that the accommodation is...one that Congress would have sanctioned." <span class="Italic">Chevron, </span>467 U.S. at 845 (citation and quotation marks omitted).

<p class="noindent-1">As relevant to the issue before the Authority, the Union argues that officer technicians should be provided with uniforms or, in the alternative, a uniform allowance in the amount of $800 because they are required to wear a uniform as a condition of their civilian employment. It further argues that Congress authorizes the expenditure of appropriated funds for uniforms or allowances; that technicians are authorized to receive uniforms or an allowance under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593, and 37 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 417-418 as long as the overall expenditure is not greater than the maximum amount permitted by law; and that DOD Instruction 1400.25, Volume 591(4)(c) authorizes a uniform or allowance not to exceed $800 per year.

The Agency argues that &#x00A7; 417 only permits an allowance or monetary reimbursement to officer technicians for uniforms, and does not allow the Agency to actually <span class="Italic">provide</span> them with uniforms.

<p class="noindent">Early FLRA decisions disfavored proposals involving uniform allowances. A proposal was nonnegotiable that the agency provide technicians an allowance for cleaning and maintenance of their required uniforms. 5 USC 5901 gave agencies a choice between providing uniforms and providing an allowance for them. It appeared that FLRA construed the statute to include any allowance for purchase of uniforms to include funds necessary for upkeep of the uniform, thereby precluding any additional negotiations. The matter was covered by statute, a nonnegotiable condition of employment. <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU and Nat'l Guard Bureau, Adjutant Gen.</span>, 26 FLRA 515, 525-26 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 775-77 (1992) (Proposals 2 and 3 were nonnegotiable, that employer pay for alterations and maintenance costs of uniforms); <span class="Italic">NAGE Locals R12-1222, R12-222 and DOD, Washington NG, Tacoma</span>, 38 FLRA 295, 303, 305-06 (1990) (Proposal 3, Part A, that agency maintain ready to wear uniforms, nonnegotiable); <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 214 and DOD, Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command</span>, 30 FLRA 1025, 1031, 1035-36 (1988) (nonnegotiable: variety of proposals requiring agency to purchase for employees specified types of clothing to be worn with uniform; also nonnegotiable: contractually-stipulated uniform allowance); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 532, 533-34 (1987) (uniform allowance was nonnegotiable because allowance was dealt with comprehensively by statute, 5 USC 5901).</p>

The record indicates that the employees in the unit are civilian technician employees of the National Guard. For the following reasons, we find that the proposal is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note at the outset that the Agency interprets the proposal as applying only to commissioned officers and warrant officers who are members of the bargaining unit.&#x2003;However, the plain wording of the proposal requires the Agency to provide a uniform, or a uniform allowance, to "each civilian employee." Moreover, as worded, the proposal specifically notes that the allowance would also apply to officers and warrant officers who provide their own uniforms and who are in the unit. Therefore, consistent with the plain wording, we interpret the proposal as requiring the Agency to provide a uniform, or a uniform allowance, to all civilian technician employees in the bargaining unit, including unit employees who are commissioned officers or warrant officers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's claim that the proposal does not concern a matter affecting conditions of employment because the proposal concerns the military aspects of civilian technicians' employment. In particular, to the extent that the Agency interprets the proposal as pertaining to the wearing of the military uniform by technicians performing their official duties in a military status, we reject that interpretation. Rather, the wording of the proposal and the record in the case support the conclusion that the proposal is intended to apply to the wearing of the military uniform by technicians performing their official duties while in a civilian status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that the proposal does not concern a matter pertaining to conditions of employment is premised on the fact that the uniform that technicians are required to wear while performing their duties is the military uniform. Based on that fact, the Agency concludes that matters pertaining to the provision of that uniform to employees must involve the military aspects of civilian technician employment. The defect in the Agency's argument is that it is premised on the nature of the uniform rather than the status of the employees who wear the uniform.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that proposals concerning the requirement that technicians wear the military uniform while in a civilian status do not concern the military aspects of technician employment but concern matters affecting the conditions of employment of civilian technicians.... Because the proposal in this case requires the Agency to provide the uniforms, or a uniform allowance, for employees who are required to wear the military uniform while performing the official duties of their positions in a civilian status, we find...that the proposal concerns a matter relating to the conditions of employment of unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_842"></span>The Agency argues that the proposal does not concern a matter that is covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a) or 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593 because the proposal concerns the military uniform and those statutory provisions apply, respectively, to employees of the Federal Government and to civilian employees of the Department of Defense. We reject the Agency's argument. National Guard civilian technicians are employees within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1)(F); 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(c). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a) authorizes an agency to provide uniforms, or a uniform allowance, to employees and contains no limitations on the nature of the uniform covered by that authorization. There is no basis in the wording of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a), and the Agency presents no other grounds, for concluding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a) does not cover the provision of uniforms, or a uniform allowance, to National Guard civilian technicians who wear the military uniform in the performance of their official duties in a civilian status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the proposal requires the Agency to provide military uniforms, or a uniform allowance covering military uniforms, for National Guard civilian technicians who are required by the Agency to wear those uniforms while performing the official duties of their positions in a civilian status. We conclude, therefore, that the proposal concerns the provision of uniforms, or a uniform allowance, for a civilian employee of the Department of Defense who is required by law or regulation to wear a prescribed uniform in the performance of official duties within the meaning of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's argument that the proposal would require "dual allowances" for officers, there is no evidence in the record to support the conclusion, and the Agency does not claim, that the uniform allowance provided in Army Regulation 37-104-3 is intended to cover purchase of uniforms for use in the performance of civilian duties. Rather, as discussed by the Agency, Army Regulation 37-104-3 appears to provide an allowance to officers for uniforms used in the performance of their military duties. In other words, the Agency has not demonstrated that the uniform allowance provided under the Army regulation is intended for the same purpose as the allowance provided by the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated that the uniform allowance provided by the proposal and the allowance under the regulation are provided for the same purpose or on the same basis.&#x2003;We also conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated that providing different allowances for different purposes and on different bases is contrary to law and regulation. The Agency has cited no provision of law or regulation that precludes separate allowances for military and civilian purposes. Consequently, we reject the Agency's argument. We note in this connection that the Agency has not claimed that the proposal is inconsistent with Army Regulation 37-104-3a or that a compelling need exists under section 7117(a)(2) of the Statute and section 2424.11 of our Rules and Regulations for that regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency argues that even if the subject of providing a uniform or a uniform allowance is a matter concerning the conditions of employment of unit employees, the proposal is nonnegotiable because the Agency head's authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a) and 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1593 to pay for uniforms or an allowance has not been delegated to the Adjutant General of Illinois. We reject this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that where authority concerning a matter relating to conditions of employment resides at a higher level within an agency, the agency is nevertheless obligated to bargain over that matter and to provide representatives who are empowered to negotiate and enter into agreements on all matters within the scope of negotiations in the bargaining unit....</p>
<p class="noindent">Another proposal declared negotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1669 and Arkansas Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 55 FLRA 63 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Arkansas Nat'l Guard</span>), invited agreement that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer will provide uniforms in a ready to wear fashion.&#x2003;All emblems, name tags[,] insignia[,] etc., will be attached, and any cost will be borne by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Arkansas Nat'l Guard</span> the Authority discerned no statutory barrier to payment of the costs. 37 USC 417 and 37 USC 418, although touching on uniform allowances, did not preclude the exercise of discretion by the agency as to the payments mandated by the bargaining proposal. <span class="Italic">ACT Rhode Island Chap. and DOD, R.I. NG</span>, 55 FLRA 420, 422-23 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Rhode Island Nat'l Guard</span>), expanded on the <span class="Italic">Arkansas Nat'l Guard</span> analysis, as FLRA approved as negotiable a proposal that uniform allowance payments and processing be in accordance with an internal agency directive:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Proposal Is Not Inconsistent With Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the amendments, the Authority held that there was a duty to bargain about uniform allowances for civilian National Guard Technicians. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, Alexandria, Virginia, </span>47 FLRA 1213 (1993). The Authority subsequently determined that there is nothing in the terms of the amended sections 417 or 418 that is inconsistent with a proposal to bargain over aspects of military uniforms for technicians. <span class="Italic">Arkansas Air National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard. </span>The proposal in this case differs from that in <span class="Italic">Arkansas Air National Guard </span>because it contains a statement that procedures for payment of uniform allowance will be in accordance with the memoranda set out in Appendix C, which reference sections 5901 and 1593. <span class="Italic">See</span> n.3, <span class="Italic">supra. </span>However, we noted in <span class="Italic">Arkansas Air National Guard </span>that sections 417 and 418, which refer to allowances not being available under sections 5901 and 1593, "could be construed as permitting the payment of an allowance under sections 5901 and 1593 in the event an allowance or uniform were not supplied under sections 417 and 418<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>at 64 n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties in <span class="Italic">Arkansas Air National Guard</span> did not dispute that sections 417 and 418 are the exclusive statutory authority for National Guard uniform allowances. However, that issue is raised in this case. As sections 417 and 418 amended the Agency's organic statute, we must determine whether Congress expressed clear intent on the question. If we determine, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, that Congress has spoken directly and had an intention on the precise issue, we must give that intention effect, "and that is the end of the matter." <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural</span> <span class="Italic">Resources Defense Council, Inc., </span>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984) <span class="Italic">(Chevron)</span>. If the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, we must determine whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. If a question is not directly addressed, we may not substitute our own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the agency. Thus, in such a case we must defer to the agency's construction if it is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 843-44; <span class="Italic">Indian Educators Federation,</span> <span class="Italic">New Mexico Federation of Teachers and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Albuquerque and Navajo Areas, </span>53 FLRA 696, 707 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first prong of <span class="Italic">Chevron, </span>we must first determine whether Congress expressed an intention that payment of a uniform allowance is to be available only under sections 417 and 418, as contended by the Agency. The language of subsections of 417 and 418 that directly addresses uniform allowances clearly indicates to us that sections 417 and 418 were not intended to be exclusive. Section 417(d)(2) provides that a uniform allowance may not be paid to an officer under sections section 1593 or section 5901 for a period for which the officer is paid an allowance under section 415 or 416. Similarly, section 418(c) provides that an allowance may not be paid to an enlisted technician under sections 1593 or 5901 for which an allowance is paid under section 418.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From this statutory language, we conclude that sections 417 and 418 are not intended to preclude allowances for uniforms under sections 5901 and 1593. The plain wording requires only that payments not be made under 5901 and 1593 for periods for which payments have been made under 417 or 418. In other words, the plain meaning of sections 417 and 418 is to preclude duplicative payments. By precluding duplicative payments, Congress acknowledged the continued viability of sections 5901 and 1593 as alternative sources for uniform allowances, rather than replacing them. If the alternative payment authority no longer existed, Congress would not have deemed it necessary to preclude duplicative payments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of our finding that Congress did not intend for sections 417 and 418 to be exclusive, it is not necessary for us to decide whether the Agency's interpretation to the contrary is reasonable under the second prong of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. As the intent of Congress clearly was that sections 417 and 418 not be the exclusive authority on which to base uniform allowances, the proposal is not inconsistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Proposal Concerns A Condition Of Employment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the argument that the topic of wearing military uniforms by technicians relates to a military aspect of technician employment, and the argument that the subject of military uniforms is specifically provided for by statute, were addressed by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Arkansas</span> <span class="Italic">Air National Guard, </span>issued subsequent to the proceedings in this case. For the reasons therein, we conclude that the proposal here does not relate to a military aspect of technician employment, <span class="Italic">see id., </span>at 65-67, and we find further that provision of military uniforms for civilian technicians is not specifically provided for by Federal statute, <span class="Italic">see id </span>at 67.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">ACT Evergreen and Ranier Chapters and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, 57 FLRA 475, 481-83 (2001) (Proposal 3) (negotiable, as consistent with 37 USC 415-18, proposal that agency provide employees with adequate number of uniforms with insignia properly sewn on; that agency provide employees with two pairs of regular or safety footwear and copay maximum rate for footwear allowed by regulation; that agency provide maximum uniform allowance authorized by statute for officers who are unit employees; that agency provide employees with cleaning services for required duty uniforms).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals were negotiable that the agency reimburse Customs Service employees for the cost of affixing patches that the agency required them to wear, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.</span>, 35 FLRA 3, 5-6 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency does not allege that the proposals do not concern conditions of employment or that they are outside the duty to bargain.... [W]e do not find, that the proposals interfere with the exercise of any management rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_843"></span>...5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a) limits the amount of money that Government agencies, whose employees are required by law or regulation to wear a prescribed uniform, can spend for uniforms. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901(a) authorizes agencies to furnish employees with uniforms at a cost not to exceed $125.00 [now $400] a year or to pay each employee an allowance for uniforms not to exceed $125.00 annually. However, some agencies are exempt from the $125.00 limit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Customs Service is...exempted.... Thus, the Agency's discretion to negotiate employees' uniform allowances...is not restricted by the statutory limit in section 5901.</p>
<p class="noindent">There was no bar to a proposal that, as an appropriate arrangement for an agency uniform requirement, the agency issue each employee five complete sets of clothing including long and short sleeve shirts and that each employee receive a jacket. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2477 and Library of Congress</span>, 23 FLRA 204, 206-08 (1986). <span class="Italic">But see AFGE Council 214 and DOD, Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command</span>, 30 FLRA 1025, 1030-33 (1988), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Rhode Island NG</span>, 38 FLRA 1005, 1009-10, 1014-15 (1990), resolved as negotiable Proposal 2, requiring the agency to provide seven sets of uniforms to each civilian technician and an exchange program for worn clothing. <span class="Italic">Rhode Island NG</span> was returned to FLRA for additional explanation of the basis of its determination that the proposal did not interfere with the agency's ability to determine the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau v. FLRA</span>, 982 F.2d 577 (D.C. Cir. 1993). On remand, FLRA again stated the proposal was negotiable, <span class="Italic">ACT and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Rhode Island NG</span>, 47 FLRA 743, 745-46 (1993), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 47 FLRA 1082 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority employs a two-prong test to determine whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. First, an agency must show a direct relationship between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission. Second, the agency must show that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirement that technicians wear a prescribed uniform while performing work constitutes the Agency's determination of the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.... Determinations regarding the composition of the uniform also constitute an exercise of that right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, the Agency has made no attempt to demonstrate a direct and integral relationship between the requirements that it provide to technicians a specified number of uniforms and additional items required as part of the uniforms and the accomplishment of the Agency's mission, and no such relationship is apparent to us. In this regard, we find that parts a, h, and i do not involve or seek to limit the Agency's determination that a specified uniform is required; its determination as to the composition of the uniform; or its determination as to the circumstances where the uniform must be worn. The Agency has not established any link between the three parts of the proposal and the technicians' performance of work, and, thus, has not satisfied the first prong of the test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties bear the burden of creating a record upon which the Authority can make a negotiability determination.... Based on the record in this case, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that parts a, h, and i conflict with its right to determine the methods and means of performing the Agency's work.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT Arizona Army Chap. 61 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Arizona NG</span>, 48 FLRA 412, 412-13, 416 (1993), approved for negotiations, for most of the same reasons, proposals that the employer provide employees with 10 sets of uniforms, additional items of clothing for mechanics, and for exchange of worn or unserviceable clothing issued pursuant to the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a subsequent Rhode Island National Guard case, FLRA declared nonnegotiable a proposal that the agency avoid disciplining an employee out of uniform or in an improper uniform if the agency failed to provide necessary replacement or repair of the employee's uniform, <span class="Italic">ACT Rhode Island Chap. and DOD, R.I. NG</span>, 55 FLRA 420, 423-27 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision concerns an exchange program for worn, torn or soiled uniforms in need of replacement because of normal wear and tear, and procedures for obtaining replacements. Paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) set out detailed procedures for obtaining replacement uniforms.... [T]he provision precludes double benefits or payment. Thus, paragraph (f) precludes exchange of uniforms for any officer if paid a uniform allowance under sections 415 or 416; (g) prohibits exchange or allowances under 1593 or 5901 to enlisted technicians who receive a uniform allowance under 415 or 416; and (h) states that an enlisted technician not entitled to receive uniform allowances under 1593 or 5901 shall receive 'uniforms or allowances under section 418.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Paragraph (c) of the provision would prohibit discipline of a technician for reporting to work in a soiled or torn uniform if a replacement uniform had been requested in a prescribed manner but not provided within time limits set out in the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;Analysis of the Provision</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Provision As A Whole As It Relates To Uniform Exchange Is Not Inconsistent With Law</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Officer Technicians</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union here seeks clothing exchange.&#x2003;As part of this plan, paragraph (f) of the provision provides that other sections of the provision, dealing with replacement of uniforms, do not apply to any officer technician for any period for which the technician receives an allowance under 37 U.S.C. sections 415 or 416. The plain language of the provision...is not inconsistent with the Authorization Act because, like the Act, the provision prohibits double benefits for uniforms. We conclude that the provision as a whole as it relates to uniform exchange is not inconsistent with law as to the officer technicians.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Enlisted Technicians</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision is not inconsistent with the Authorization Act, section 418(c) of which prohibits duplicative payments, because the provision itself precludes duplicative military uniform benefits. Like paragraph (f) in the case of officer technicians, paragraph (g) precludes duplicative benefits for enlisted technicians, under sections 1593 or 5901, for any period for which a uniform allowance is paid under sections 415 or 416. Paragraph (h) provides that enlisted technicians not entitled to receive allowances under section 1593 or 5901 shall receive the uniform benefits referenced in the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the provision explicitly precludes duplication of benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore conclude that the provision as a whole as it relates to uniform exchange is not inconsistent with law as to enlisted technicians.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Provision Concerns A Condition Of Employment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the argument that the topic of wearing of military uniforms by technicians relates to a military aspect of technician employment, and that the subject is specifically provided for by Federal statute, were recently addressed by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Arkansas Air National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, </span>55 FLRA at 65-67. For the reasons therein, we conclude that the provision in its entirety does not relate to a military aspect of technician employment, and we also find that provision of military uniforms for civilian technicians is not specifically provided for by Federal statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Paragraph (c), Which Concerns Discipline, Is Inconsistent With Law</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Paragraph (c) of the Provision Interferes With Management's Right to Discipline</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Paragraph (c) provides that the Agency will not discipline a technician for reporting in a soiled or torn uniform if the technician has properly and timely requested a replacement uniform and it has not been provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The essence of the Union's argument is that the Agency should not be permitted to discipline a technician for behavior resulting from its own failure to meet the procedural requirements of the provision. The effect of this paragraph would be to prohibit management from initiating discipline for specified conduct. Therefore, it is contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1815</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation</span> <span class="Italic">Center and Fort Rucker, Fort Rucker, Alabama,</span> 53 FLRA 606, 616-17 (1997) (Proposal 8) (provision that would prohibit discipline for refusal to obey an order that would endanger employee's personal safety or the safety of others interferes with right to discipline because prevents management from disciplining for specified conduct); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1345 and U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Army, Headquarters, Fort Carson and Headquarters, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colorado,</span> 48 FLRA 168, 202 (1993) (Proposal 15) (proposal to prohibit agency from disciplining employee for failing to obey an order that would require employee to place self in danger of death or serious bodily harm directly interferes with right to discipline because proposal prevents management from disciplining employees for specified conduct).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;Paragraph (c) Is Not A Negotiable Appropriate Arrangement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that even if the provision interferes with the management right to discipline, it would be an appropriate arrangement under section 7103(b)(3). As section 7103(b)(3) is an exception to section 7106(a), we proceed to discuss whether paragraph (c) of the provision is a negotiable "appropriate arrangement" under section 7103(b)(3) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See National Association of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local R5-184 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span> <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky, 51 </span>FLRA 386 (1995); <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Montana</span> <span class="Italic">Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA, </span>22 F.3d 1150 (D.C. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The approach for determining whether a provision is within the duty to bargain under section 7103(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG). </span>Under that approach, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span id="page_844"></span>An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue</span> <span class="Italic">Service v. FLRA, </span>960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The adverse effect need not flow from the management right that a given proposal affects. <span class="Italic">E.g., National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 243 and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office), 49</span> FLRA 176, 184 (1994) (Member Armendariz concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's right(s). <span class="Italic">E.g., id</span>. As the Authority reaffirmed, relying on <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Interior,</span> <span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service, New Orleans, Louisiana</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA, </span>969 F.2d 1158, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1992), section 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain proposals that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National</span> <span class="Italic">Border Patrol, Council and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1319 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency submits that the effect of the discipline paragraph is identical to the provision prohibiting adverse action for poor performance caused by the failure of management to provide customary training opportunities in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1900</span>, 51 FLRA at 140-41, Provision 7. Provision 7 provided that adverse actions would not be taken against employees for poor performance caused by management's failure to provide training due to lack of funds or mission requirements. The Union in that case did not dispute that the provision interfered with the right to direct employees and assign work. However, it argued that the provision constituted an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority stated in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1900 </span>that the obligation to provide training was contractually-created, and the disputed sentence established a mechanism to protect employees adversely affected by management's failure to adhere to that contractual obligation. Consequently, the provision was not an arrangement because it addressed an adverse effect that resulted from denial of a negotiated benefit, not the exercise of a management right. As a result, the provision was nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That provision is similar to the paragraph on discipline under consideration here.&#x2003;The procedures by which an employee obtains a replacement uniform are created by regulations, and confer a benefit on employees. Thus, the discipline paragraph in the instant case mitigates the effect of the breach of the Agency's contractual duty rather than the exercise of a management right. We find the restriction on discipline in paragraph (c) to be indistinguishable from the restriction in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1900. </span>Accordingly, it is not negotiable as an appropriate arrangement.</p>
