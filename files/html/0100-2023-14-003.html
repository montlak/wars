<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Telework is within management's right to assign or approve, although unions may negotiate for telework arrangements as procedures or arrangements. </span>Nonnegotiable as an interference with management's right to assign work through a determination of where work will be performed was a proposal in <span class="Italic">NTEU and NCUA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v66/66-110.html">66 FLRA 584</a>, 585-86 (2012), allowing field employees to decide whether to perform work at home (for purposes of determining travel time) before or after visiting another worksite. The proposal was not argued to be an appropriate arrangement. A term bargaining proposal to increase telework allotments under a prior contract was not successful in a negotiability challenge in <span class="Italic">NTEU and USDA, FNS</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-133.html">71 FLRA 703</a>, 703-08 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (vacated, remanded, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210622158">1 F.4th 1120</a> (D.C. Cir. 2021), <span class="Italic">post</span>), when the proposal was not advanced as a procedure or an arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During term bargaining, the parties exchanged several proposals regarding Article 20 of the parties' current collective-bargaining agreement. That article, as relevant here, allowed certain employees to <span id="page_606"></span>telework up to six days per pay period. The Agency proposed to retain a section of Article 20 that requires employees who telework to report to the office a minimum of two workdays per week. The Union proposed to "expand" Article 20 to allow employees to report to the office as little as once per week, and under specified circumstances, to telework up to eight days per pay period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;The Act does not give the Agency sole and exclusive discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal is nonnegotiable because the Act gives the head of the Agency, the Secretary of Agriculture, sole and exclusive discretion to determine the telework policy of the Agency. Specifically, the Agency argues that the plain language of &#x00A7; 6502(a)(1)(A)[14] and the legislative history of the Act demonstrate that Congress intended to give the Secretary of Agriculture unfettered discretion to set the Agency's telework policy.[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6502(a)(1)(A) ("[T]he head of each executive agency shall--establish a policy under which eligible employees of the agency may be authorized to telework.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15] Statement Br. At 21-22, 24-25; Statement, Attach. 13, H.R. 1722, 111th Cong. (2009); Statement, Attach. 14, Pub. L. No. 111-292; Statement, Attach. 15, Senate Report for S.707, S. Rep. No. 111-177 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In analyzing claims of sole and exclusive discretion, the Authority looks at the plain wording and the legislative history of the statute in question.[16] While unfettered discretion is typically indicated by such phrases as "notwithstanding any law" or "without regard to the provisions of other laws," such a signal is not required and the entire wording of the legislation must be considered.[17] In the absence of any indication that Congress intended the agency's discretion to be sole and exclusive, the exercise of discretion through collective bargaining is consistent with law.[18]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;The proposal affects the management rights to assign work and direct employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) and &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal affects management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute because management's right to assign work should include the right to tell employees the physical location at which they will perform work. In other words, the Agency argues that this proposal affects an inherent management right to tell an employee <span class="Italic">when</span> that employee must report to the duty station. While the proposal at issue would establish an elaborate framework to allow for telework nearly eight days a pay period, the proposal begins by establishing that an employee is only obligated to be at the duty station <span id="page_607"></span>one day per week; the Agency's management rights arguments focus on this frequency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held previously that the right to assign work includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned.[31] Upon review of our prior caselaw and the arguments presented here, we determine that the frequency of telework--the "when" an eligible employee may perform his or her duties away from the duty station and "when" that eligible employee must report to the duty station--is inherent to management's right to assign work.</p>

Because this proposal establishes that a telework-eligible employee could report to the duty station as little as one day per week, the proposal affects management's right to assign work. We will no longer follow cases holding otherwise.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Agency also argues that the proposal affects management's right to direct employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). The Authority has not previously addressed whether a proposal concerning the frequency of telework affects the right to direct employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). But the Authority has long held that this right includes the right to "supervise and guide [employees] in the performance" of their job duties,[37] and proposals that preclude management from using a particular method of supervising employees' work performance affect management's right to direct employees.[38]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1712</span>, 62 FLRA 15, 16 (2007) (<span class="Italic">Local 1712</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 834 (1991)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the proposal imposes substantive restraints on management's "right to determine the methods used to evaluate and supervise its employees."[39] By allowing eligible employees to spend up to 80% of each pay period outside of the office, the proposal effectively (1) <span class="Italic">requires</span> management to employ computer- and telephone-based supervision techniques and, correspondingly, (2) <span class="Italic">precludes</span> management from regularly using in-person methods of supervision, such as unannounced visits or spot checks. As a result, the proposal interferes with the Agency's right to choose the method that it deems "most appropriate" for supervising employee performance.[40] Management has the right to provide its supervisors with in-person access to employees for the purpose of directing, monitoring, and evaluating their work. Accordingly, consistent with Authority precedent, we find that this proposal affects the right to direct employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A careful review of the Proposal and related CBA provisions makes plain that the FLRA did not reasonably explain how its interpretation of the Proposal--that it "dictates to management how often the [FNS] can require an employee to perform work at the duty station"--follows from the proposed CBA's text and structure. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 707. Specifically, the FLRA failed to address the proposed CBA provisions limiting telework eligibility and maintaining management discretion to deny a telework request. Rather than explain how the proposed CBA's text and structure were consistent with its interpretation of the Proposal, the FLRA majority made no mention of these CBA provisions. Nor did it discuss whether its management rights analysis applied equally to "expanded telework" in Section 20.06(2)(b) and "regular telework" in Section 20.06(2)(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To receive approval for "<span class="Italic">[a]ll</span> telework arrangements," an employee must get "prior supervisory approval." J.A. 113 (Section 20.06(1)) (emphasis added). Supervisory approval is based on whether the telework request <span id="page_608"></span>"interfere[s] with the [FNS]'s ability to accomplish its work." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In other words, supervisors have the discretion to deny a telework request if they determine the request negatively affects the FNS's work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the proposed CBA limits an employee's eligibility for telework in Sections 20.02 and 20.03, as stated explicitly in Section 20.06(2)(a). Telework eligibility requirements include: (1) whether the employee's physical presence is required either for contact with the public or co-workers or to perform particular tasks; (2) whether the employee has sufficient experience on the job; and (3) whether the employee's work can be evaluated for timeliness, quality and/or quantity. See J.A. 110-12 (Section 20.02(1)(a)(i), (ii); Section 20.03(2)(a), (c)). Moreover, to be eligible to apply for "expanded telework," the employee must have already received FNS approval to "telework[ ] at least six (6) days per pay period. . .for a year," i.e., the maximum amount allowed pursuant to "regular telework," and have had no "performance. . .or disciplinary issues over the same period." J.A. 114 (Section 20.06(2)(b)(i)-(ii)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the FNS has the authority "to make changes in an employee's telework schedule, if it is. . .necessary for the [FNS] to accomplish its work." J.A. 114 (Section 20.06(3)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> J.A. 118 (Section 20.07(8)) ("Supervisors may modify or terminate an employee's Telework Agreement whenever the employee no longer meets the criteria outlined in this Article, does not conform to the terms of the Telework Agreement, or when the arrangement no longer supports the [FNS]'s mission."). Thus, in addition to its discretion to deny a telework request, the FNS can revoke or alter an employee's telework schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision, however, the FLRA majority never addressed the discretion afforded FNS management or the various telework-eligibility requirements embedded in the proposed CBA. It referenced the text of the Proposal only in a single footnote which, in its entirety, reads:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The dissent reads the [P]roposal as though it merely sets forth minimum requirements for telework, while allowing supervisors unlimited discretion to deny telework requests from eligible employees. But that reading cannot be squared with the [P]roposal's plain wording, which creates a <span class="Italic">presumptive entitlement</span> to 80% telework for employees who have teleworked at least six days per pay period the previous year and have "not had any performance (i.e., a performance improvement plan) or disciplinary issues over the same period." The [P]roposal creates a strong presumption that all such requests will be granted by mandating that telework requests from eligible employees will not be "unreasonably denied." In practice, this means that any manager who denies 80% telework to an eligible employee can expect to face a grievance alleging that the denial was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 704 n.11 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Notably absent from the FLRA majority's decision is any discussion of both the specific telework-eligibility requirements set forth in Sections 20.02 and 20.03 and the FNS's case-by-case discretion regarding employee telework requests set forth in Sections 20.06(1) and 20.06(3). Nor does the FLRA majority explain how those proposed CBA provisions can be squared with its categorization of the Proposal as a "presumptive entitlement" to telework four days a week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, reasoned decisionmaking requires the FLRA to consider the Proposal's specifications, together with the proposed CBA's relevant telework-eligibility and management-discretion provisions, in order to determine whether the Proposal affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a).</p>

In particular, the Union asserts that, based on an increase in the volume of work and a diminished staff, employees are unable to complete their work assignments during their regular work hours. Assuming that the proposal constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, we nonetheless find that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the proposal would benefit employees by allowing them to complete their work assignments "in a timely and professional manner[,]" thereby increasing their opportunities for advancement<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, these asserted benefits do not outweigh the burdens the proposal places on the exercise of management's right to assign work. The proposal would essentially permit employees to determine when and where to perform their work--that is, during the workday at their assigned duty locations, or at home, during evening hours or on weekends. In addition, the proposal would permit employees to determine when work would be performed on an overtime basis. Although the Agency would retain the right to deny an employee's request to take work home, the proposal would operate to severely restrict the Agency's right to do so. As we have interpreted the proposal, it would require the Agency "generally" to approve employee requests to take work home. The Union explained that, by use of the term "generally," management "will be expected to approve the request if the employee has presented justification...." Conference Record at 2. Management would be able to deny an employee's request only where there is no justification at all or in other limited, unspecified circumstances. On balance, we find that the intrusion on the exercise of management's right to assign work outweighs any benefits to employees.</p>

<p class="noindent">Telecommuting was discussed in a decision reviewing an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of HUD Local 222 and HUD</span>, 60 FLRA 311, 311-14 (2004), and concluding that union officials on official time did not have a statutory right to telecommute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that Section 359 of Public Law 106-346 (&#x00A7; 359) requires each executive agency to establish a telecommuting program for eligible employees and charges the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director with ensuring that such programs are available to all eligible employees.[2] The Arbitrator also found that the legislative history of &#x00A7; 359 defines "telecommuting" as "any arrangement in which an employee regularly performs officially assigned duties at home or other worksite...." [Award at 44.] The Arbitrator further found that OPM developed the OPM Telework Manual (the OPM Manual), which adopts the definition of telecommuting set forth in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 359 and provides guidelines to agencies in establishing and implementing the telecommuting programs required by that section.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Public Law 106-346, &#x00A7; 359 states:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Each executive agency shall establish a policy under which eligible employees of the agency may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance. Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall provide that the requirements of this section are applied to 25 percent of the Federal workforce, and to an additional 25 percent of such workforce each year thereafter.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that, by adopting the definition of telecommuting set forth in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 359, OPM intended to limit telecommuting to the performance of "official duties only." The Arbitrator further determined that, under Authority precedent, the "performance of Union representational duties is distinct from the performance of 'official agency duties.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 45 (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Dallas, Tex</span>., 53 FLRA 20 (1997) (<span class="Italic">AAFES, Dallas</span>)). Based on these determinations, the Arbitrator found that the performance of Union representational duties did not constitute "officially assigned duties" as that term is used in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 359, and specifically adopted in the OPM Manual. He concluded that the Union had failed to demonstrate that &#x00A7; 359 and its legislative history, the OPM Manual, or Authority precedent contemplated "a right for Union representatives to perform Union representational activities [in] telework status" or that "telework was to be made applicable to Union representatives performing Union representational work...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the parties' agreement, the Arbitrator reviewed the bargaining history of Supplement 3, Item 11 and found that the supplement did not authorize Union representatives on 100 percent official time to perform representational activities while telecommuting. In this regard, the Arbitrator determined that there was no evidence that, during the <span id="page_609"></span>negotiations resulting in Supplement 3, Item 11 that the parties agreed that "Union representatives could perform Union representational duties on telework status...." The Arbitrator also determined that the Agency's Telework Program Policy Guide (Agency Guide), which was developed by a joint labor-management committee, specifically referenced the OPM Manual and that there was no indication during the development of the Agency Guide that "the Union ever raised as an issue...the performance of Union representational duties...while in a telework status."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator found that no past practice of permitting Union representatives on official time to telecommute existed within the Agency. In this connection, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency, at the national level, had the authority to interpret and apply the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator also determined that local supervisors had authorized certain Union representatives on official time to telecommute and that Agency headquarters had approved some Union representatives' telecommuting applications. The Arbitrator found that, upon discovering that Union representatives on official time had been authorized to telecommute, the Agency, at the national level, ordered local supervisors to discontinue such arrangements. The Arbitrator concluded that the "individual approval" of "a few" requests of Union officials to perform representational work while in telecommuting status did not demonstrate acquiescence in, or awareness of, a general practice at the national level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 359 requires executive agencies to "establish a policy under which eligible employees...may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible...." Dep't of Transp. &#x0026; Related Agencies--Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 106-346 &#x00A7; 359, 114 Stat. 1356 (2000). "Telecommuting" is defined in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 359 as "any arrangement in which an employee regularly performs officially assigned duties at home or other work site...." <span class="Italic">See</span> Award at 45; and H.R. CONF. REP. No. 106-940, &#x00A7; 359, at 151 (2000), <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>2000 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1063, 1143.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties cite, and we are otherwise aware of, no basis for a Federal agency to establish a telecommuting program, except pursuant to &#x00A7; 359. Accordingly, we find that Congress intended &#x00A7; 359 to be the sole authority for such programs. Further, in considering &#x00A7; 359 together with its legislative history, it is clear that Congress intended to limit telecommuting to the performance of "officially assigned duties." Although &#x00A7; 359 and its legislative history do not provide a specific definition for the term "officially assigned duties," the Authority has, in a recent decision involving a similar issue, applied its own precedent to determine the meaning of undefined wording in another statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.,</span> 60 FLRA 20, 22-23 (2004) (Authority applied own precedent to determine the meaning of "performs work," an undefined term in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546(b)). Accordingly, we apply our precedent to determine the meaning of "official agency duties," as used in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 359.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the performance of representational duties does not involve the performance of "work" as used in the phrase "technology of performing work" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Council 214, AFL-CIO</span>, 31 FLRA 1259, 1261-62 (1988). The Authority has similarly held that the performance of representational activities does not involve "work" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> AAFES, Dallas</span>, 53 FLRA at 24. The Authority also has determined that, under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, job performance encompasses the performance of agency-assigned duties and does not include duties performed on behalf of a union. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals</span>, 48 FLRA 357, 364 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the precedent, we conclude that, just as the performance of representational duties does not constitute agency-assigned duties under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or the work of an agency under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the performance of representational duties does not constitute the performance of "officially assigned duties" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 359. Consequently, &#x00A7; 359 does not apply so as to authorize union representatives on official time to telecommute. As such, the award, finding that Union representatives on official time are not authorized to telecommute, is not contrary to &#x00A7; 359 and its legislative history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's claims that the award is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3911</span> and <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65</span>. In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3911</span>, there was no argument before the Authority concerning whether union representatives on official time were prohibited by law from telecommuting and, thus, the Authority did not address that issue. In <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65</span>, the Authority found that employees on flexible work schedules who were required to attend an agency scheduled labor-management meeting before or after the employee's basic work requirement were permitted to earn credit hours because attendance at such meetings constituted "duty time" and counted toward meeting the employee's basic work requirement under the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6120-6133. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65</span>, 25 FLRA at 376-77. As <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65</span> concerns basic work requirements under the Work Schedules Act, and does not address whether Union representatives on official time are authorized to telecommute under &#x00A7; 359, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Union has failed to establish that the award, finding that Union representatives on official time are not authorized to telecommute, is contrary to &#x00A7; 359, its legislative history, or Authority precedent. As such, we deny the exceptions.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In light of this conclusion, we also reject the Union's claim that the Arbitrator improperly relied on the OPM Manual, which merely adopts the definition of telecommuting set forth in &#x00A7; 359 and its legislative history. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exceptions at 8 9. As the award is not deficient under &#x00A7; 359, neither is the Arbitrator's reliance on the OPM Manual. We note, in addition, that the Agency Guide, which was jointly developed by the parties, specifically provides that telework options are established in accordance with the OPM Manual.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although the statute discussed in <span class="Italic">Council of HUD Locals 222</span> did not authorize telecommuting for union officials performing representational duties on official time, union officials could obtain authorization for telecommuting for the same purpose through a contract or past practice under <span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and AFGE Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 62 FLRA 364, 367 (2008):</p>

As &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Statute authorizes the negotiation of all aspects of official time and the Agency has pointed to no law which prohibits union officials from performing representational duties at home offices, we find that the Agency's past practice was not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also well-established that an agency is required to fulfill its obligation to bargain in good faith before changing conditions of employment, which may be established by past practice. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Bd.

<p class="noindent-1">Q 29. On what topics must agencies bargain in connection with directing employees to return to the worksite?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A. There may be a number of topics an agency may be asked to collectively bargain over in connection with directing employees to return to the worksite. Some topics that may come up include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; How much advance notice will employees be provided before they are required to return to the office?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; How will any decision to return to the office be communicated to the workforce?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; What safety measures will be established to help protect the workforce when returning to the work location and how will they be implemented?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; What options are available to employees who are telework eligible and otherwise interested in continuing to telework on a greater basis?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; Will the agency be able to provide assistance to employees on dependent care issues?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; What transit subsidies or parking benefits will be available to employees directed to return to agency worksites?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; What steps will the agency take to enforce new safety requirements?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These are some examples of issues that may come up through the collective bargaining process. In light of this, agencies are strongly encouraged to take the necessary time to work with their unions to address any issues that come up. Agencies should consult with offices of human resources and agency legal counsel to determine appropriate labor relations obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Q 30. How does the EO 14003 direction to bargain over permissive subjects contained in 5 USC 7106(b)(1) impact agency plans to return workers to their official office of record?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A. Agencies are reminded that Section 4 of Executive Order (EO) 14003 provides that "[t]he head of each agency subject to the provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, shall elect to negotiate over the subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and shall instruct subordinate officials to do the same."

<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; the technology, methods, and means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Through various decisions, the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) has provided some explanation of these subjects over the years:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; "Numbers, types, and grades" concerns the establishment of agency staffing patterns, or the allocation of staff, to agency subdivisions, work projects, or work shifts;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Numbers" refers to the number of employees or staff to be assigned duties (to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Types" refers to distinguishable classes, kinds, groups or categories of employees or positions that are relevant to the establishment of staffing patterns (for any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Grades" refers to the grades of employees to be assigned duties (to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty)[1];</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Organizational subdivision" refers to the organizational structure;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Work project" means a particular job or task;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Tour of duty" refers to periods when employees are on duty or hours of work shifts;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; "Technology" has been construed to refer to the technical method an agency will use in accomplishing or furthering the performance of its work; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; "Method" has been construed to refer to the way in which an agency performs its work;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">&#x2022; "Means" has been construed to refer to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(14) excludes "the classification of any position" from "conditions of employment" for determining when matters are subject to collective bargaining. Generally, "numbers, types, and grades" are considered together when discussing establishment of agency staffing patterns. For example, a union may seek to negotiate that a certain "type" of employee be assigned to a "work project." Typically, a specific 'type' of employee has a position description containing the duties of the job along with the job title and occupational series. Based on those duties, the job has already been classified by the agency at a particular grade level.</p>
