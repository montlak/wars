<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-27"><span class="space">3.</span> Identity of Issues</h4>
<p class="noindent">In recent years FLRA decisions attempt to avoid duplicative ULP charges and contract grievances. The 2020 decision in <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 1594</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-154.html">71 FLRA 785</a>, 786 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, focused on a pragmatic rather than legalistic approach: "substantially similar legal theories...based on the same agency action and...the same remedies." Times change. Decisional trends change. That much should be remembered as the decisions below, issued before 2020, are considered.</p>
<p class="noindent">At least through 2018 and <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic and IBPO Local 800</span>, <span class="blue">70 FLRA 512</span>, 514-18 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., 70 FLRA 860 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and with a cautionary admonition that the decisions that follow may not be reliable precedent, depending on the circumstances, one party may file a grievance protesting a contract violation and the same party may file a ULP charge from the closely related unilateral change in employment conditions. For a ULP charge to block a grievance, the issues in the ULP and grievance cases must be the same. An arbitrator may review conduct of an agency in one office despite similar, but not identical, conduct leading to an unsuccessful ULP charge involving another office. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, OHA, Region II and AFGE Local 1760</span>, 36 FLRA 448, 451 (1990) (involving alleged failure of agency to bargain over prohibition of playing of radios and televisions in work areas); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Library of Congress and FPO Library of Congress Labor Comm.</span>, 58 FLRA 486, 488 (2003) (separation in years and particular circumstances prevented ULP charge pertaining to official charge usage by one union official in one set of circumstances from barring subsequent grievance concerning official time usage by different official in different circumstances). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS</span>, 52 FLRA 658, 663-64 (1996) (arbitrator properly declined jurisdiction when ULP and grievance both challenged change in dress code, but earlier ULP apparently pertained to broader group of personnel than were encompassed by grievance). A grievance and ULP charge may be litigated independently if they raise distinct issues, e.g., a ULP charged that a suspension violated the Statute because of the improper procedures used in implementing the suspension; as to the grievance, the question was whether on the merits the suspension was for just cause. <span class="Italic">DOD, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and AFGE Local 2317</span>, 37 FLRA 1268, 1275 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 919 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Leavenworth</span>, 68 FLRA 573, 575-76 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), is one of many decisions confirming that a union could file a ULP charge concerning a unilateral change in working conditions on facts that also permit it to file a grievance concerning a breach of the collective bargaining agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the framework set forth above, we find that the Union's grievance is not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) because it does not "advance a substantially similar legal theor[y]" as the earlier-filed ULP charge. Here, the Union's ULP charge is based on a statutory claim that the Agency failed to negotiate with the Union regarding the impact and implementation of the new software, in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. The Union's ULP charge does not mention the parties' agreement at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's later-filed grievance is based on a contractual claim that the Agency is violating Article 18(p) of the parties' agreement by failing to equitably distribute overtime assignments by skipping bargaining-unit members in assigning overtime. As discussed above, the Authority has long held that "an alleged statutory violation relies on a different legal theory than an alleged contract violation." Therefore, the Union's ULP charge, which alleged a violation of the Statute, does not result in a &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar on the Union's later-filed grievance, which alleges a violation of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the Arbitrator misapplied &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, we reject, as we have in other cases,[40] the dissent's suggestion that a union's grievance--alleging only a contractual violation--and its ULP charge--alleging only a violation of the Statute--"raise the same issue over the same subject matter." The dissent notes that "[t]he only difference between" the Union's claims is that, in the grievance, the Union did not mention the Statute. The dissent describes this distinction as a "sleight of hand" or "ruse" by the Union. But it is well settled under Authority precedent "that purely contractual violations are not ULPs and, thus, may not be litigated in the statutory-ULP process."[44] And the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, "[e]ndorsing this distinction under &#x00A7; 7116(d)...observed that it 'would be strange indeed...to contend' that a ULP 'charge concern[ing] a statutory violation' and a grievance alleging a 'violation of [a parties'] agreement...present an identical issue.'"[45] The dissent provides no basis for abandoning this well-established distinction when applying the &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Chicago grievance and the San Francisco grievance are based on the same legal theories as the ULP charge because each alleges that the Agency improperly implemented and applied the 2018 agreement. The Union disputes this characterization of the grievances. We note that the earlier-filed ULP charge alleges that the Agency refused the Union's multiple requests to negotiate, failed to bargain in good faith, and unilaterally implemented the 2018 CBA, all in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. The grievances, on the other hand, allege that, by requiring the Union to vacate Agency-owned office space that had previously been designated to the Union, the Agency violated specific articles of the 2013 agreement and &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114 and 7121 of the Statute. While the Chicago grievance also contains a separate charge of union animus, in violation of &#x00A7; 7116, it does not concern a failure to bargain, as did the earlier-filed ULP charge. Thus, in addition to being based on different factual circumstances,[28] the grievances and the ULP charge plainly allege violations of different sections of the Statute. They are not based on the same--or substantially similar--legal theories.[29] Accordingly, we deny these exceptions.</p>

<p class="noindent">But if both a grievance and ULP allege a violation of a collective bargaining agreement's provision concerning dues deduction, because the gravamen of the complaint and the grievance appears to be the same, the earlier filing of the grievance precludes processing of the ULP relating to the same matter as the grievance.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 39 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Norfolk</span>, 44 FLRA 1291, 1297-99 (1992), provides an example of analysis of similarity of issues, affirming an arbitration award that rejected a grievance (following a ULP charge) protesting the agency's failure to negotiate a higher level of environmental differential pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Arbitrator properly refused jurisdiction over the grievance in accordance with section 7116(d) of the Statute. We also conclude that the Union's exceptions do not establish that the Arbitrator's award fails to draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement or is otherwise deficient. Therefore, we will deny the Union's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) of the Statute provides that issues which may be raised under a negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under that procedure or as an unfair labor practice, but not under both procedures. For a grievance to be precluded under section 7116(d) by an earlier-filed unfair labor practice charge, all of the following conditions must be met: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the unfair labor practice; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedures; and (3) the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures must have been in the discretion of the aggrieved party....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's award finding that the grievance filed on October 5, 1990, was barred by the ULP charge of August 31, 1990, is consistent with the above requirements of section 7116(d) of the Statute. The Arbitrator found that the issue in the grievance and the ULP charge was the same and there is no dispute that the ULP charge was filed prior to the filing of the grievance. "In determining whether the grievance and the ULP charge involve the same issue, the Authority will look at whether the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances and whether the theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2317</span>, 37 FLRA 1268, 1272 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>). The Arbitrator compared the statement of issue in the ULP charge with the issue framed in the grievance and found that the issues were the same. We agree with the Arbitrator that the issue in the ULP charge and the issue in the grievance are "virtually identical." Both issues derived from the same set of facts and both issues clearly concerned the Union's contention that the Agency failed to negotiate over a proposed new category of EDP at the rate of 8 percent to replace the existing 4 percent rate of EDP for exposure to toxic chemicals. Based on the plain wording of the ULP charge and the grievance as set forth in the Arbitrator's award, we reject the Union's contention that the grievance concerned the Agency's failure to pay EDP in accordance with applicable Government-wide regulations and that the grievance did not allege the same failure to negotiate that was alleged in the ULP charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we conclude that the theories relied on by the union in support of its contentions were the same in the ULP charge and in the grievance. The Union argued in both the ULP charge and in the grievance that the Agency had violated its obligation to negotiate over the Union's request for a higher rate of EDP. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>, 37 FLRA at 1272-73 (theories advanced in support of ULP charge and grievance found to be the same when both theories alleged violation of collective bargaining agreement in reissuing a notice of proposed suspension). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 43 FLRA 318, 323-26 (1991) (Authority found that a ULP proceeding was not barred by earlier-filed grievances because the theory underlying the ULP was different from the theories underlying the grievances, although the ULP and the grievances arose from the same factual circumstances).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no merit in the Union's contention that the ULP charge could not be a bar to the Arbitrator's consideration of the grievance because the ULP charge was withdrawn and never adjudicated. The Authority has consistently held that an issue is "raised" within the meaning of section 7116(d) of the Statute at the time of the filing of a grievance or a ULP charge, even if the grievance or ULP charge is not adjudicated on the merits....&#8197;Therefore, for purposes of section 7116(d), the Union raised the issue of the Agency's failure to negotiate over a new higher rate of EDP when it filed the ULP charge, even though the charge was subsequently withdrawn. The Union's argument that it withdrew the ULP charge "upon the advice of the FLRA Field Agent" does not alter the fact that the issue was raised under the ULP procedures. Further, the Union has not contended, and it is not apparent from the record in the case, that the Union did not exercise its discretion when it filed the ULP charge before filing the grievance. Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator properly determined that the grievance was not arbitrable under section 7116(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that because it had filed a grievance in February 1989, seeking a higher rate of EDP, the ULP charge was precluded under section 7116(d) of the Statute, thus making the grievance of October 5, 1990 arbitrable. According to the Arbitrator's award, the grievance that was filed in February 1989 asserted that "the plating operations warranted 8% or high degree of hazard [EDP] as opposed to the 4% or low degree hazard [EDP] the employees had been receiving." We find that the issue in the February 1989 grievance and the issue in the ULP charge were not the same. The February 1989 grievance concerned the substance of the Union's request for a higher rate of EDP and the ULP charge concerned the Union's allegation that the Agency <span id="page_1705"></span>failed to negotiate over a later request for a higher rate of EDP. Therefore, there is no basis for the Union's contention.</p>
<p class="noindent">Summing matters up, FLRA described in <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA, Defense Depot Memphis and AFGE Local 2501</span>, 40 FLRA 334, 339 (1991), the type of findings that an arbitrator should make when he is faced with an election or remedies issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]o find that the ULP charge and the grievance present the same issue within the meaning of section 7116(d), the arbitrator must determine that the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances and that the theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar. Should the arbitrator find that the ULP charge and the grievance present the same issue, the arbitrator must then consider the remaining factors set forth previously before finding that section 7116(d) bars the grievance in this case. Specifically, the arbitrator would have to consider: (1) whether the issue in the grievance had been earlier raised under the ULP procedures; and (2) whether the aggrieved party in the grievance and the ULP proceedings was the same and, if so, whether the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures was in the discretion of that party.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216 and EEOC</span>, 49 FLRA 906, 914-16 (1994), provides an example of how a single problem, e.g., a suspension, may be litigated under both ULP and grievance procedures if issues are carefully isolated and litigated independently in each forum. In <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> isolation of issues allowed litigation in the ULP forum of whether the suspension was motivated by union animus; in the contract forum the dispute was whether the suspension was for just cause:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a grievance to be precluded under section 7116(d) of the Statute by an earlier-filed ULP charge: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the ULP; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the ULP procedures; and (3) the selection of the ULP procedures must have been in the discretion of the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2317</span>, 37 FLRA 1268, 1272 (1990). In determining whether a grievance and a ULP charge involve the same issue, we will look at whether the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances and whether the legal theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that section 7116(d) of the Statute did not bar the portion of the grievance concerning whether the grievant's suspension was issued for sufficient cause as will promote the efficiency of the Federal service because he found that that issue was not raised in the earlier-filed ULP charges. The Agency excepts to this finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Arbitrator that the portion of the grievance addressed by the Arbitrator is not barred from consideration by the earlier-filed ULP charges. Both the grievance and the ULP charge in Case No. 2-CA-00001 arose from the Agency's decision to suspend the grievant, but the legal theories advanced in the cases are different. The theory advanced in the relevant portion of the ULP charge is that management proposed to suspend the grievant in retaliation for her Union activity and that doing so constituted unlawful discrimination in violation of section 7116(a)(1), (2), and (4) of the Statute. In contrast, the theory advanced in the relevant portion of the grievance is that there was not sufficient cause under the parties' agreement to support issuing the grievant a 14-day suspension. Thus, the grievance raises a contractual matter not contained in the ULP charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the theory advanced in the relevant portion of the grievance involved solely a question of contract interpretation and application, whereas the theory advanced in the ULP charge concerned solely a statutory violation based on retaliation and discrimination, we find that the issues in the two proceedings are clearly different. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Contract Audit Agency, Northeastern Region, Lexington, Massachusetts and American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Locals 163</span>, 47 FLRA 1314, 1320-21 (1993) (where the legal theory advanced in the grievance involved solely a question of contract interpretation and application, and the theory advanced in the ULP charge concerned a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute based on discriminatory treatment of the union and unlawful interference with union activity, the issues in the two proceedings were different for purposes of section 7116(d)); <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d at 178 (noting that the ULP charge and the grievance in <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>), were based on different legal predicates because "the ULP charge in OEA alleged a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a) [of the Statute], while the grievance claimed a breach of the collective bargaining agreement").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, <span class="Italic">INS</span>, and <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span> as support for its argument that the grievance should be barred based on Authority precedent. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span> and <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, the Authority found that the issues raised in the ULP and grievance proceedings were the same because in both proceedings the aggrieved parties alleged that management was taking, or proposing to take, disciplinary action against the grievants because of their union activity. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, the Authority found that "[b]ecause the theory to support both [the ULP charge and the grievance] is that the grievant was disciplined because of [u]nion activities,...the grievance raised the same issue as had been raised previously in the ULP charge." 38 FLRA at 1352 (citing <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 18 FLRA at 315). Unlike those cases, the portion of the grievance addressed by the Arbitrator in this case does not raise the issue of retaliation for Union activities that was raised previously in the ULP charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is also distinguishable from <span class="Italic">VAMC</span> because both the grievance and the ULP charge in that case alleged that the agency's actions violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement, whereas in this case, only the grievance, not the ULP charge, raised the issue of whether the Agency's actions violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Further, we find that the Agency has not shown that the circumstances in <span class="Italic">INS</span> are sufficiently similar to this case so as to warrant the conclusion that the ULP charge bars the grievance here. In this regard, there is no indication that the grievance in <span class="Italic">INS</span> raised a contractual issue not advanced in the earlier-filed ULP charge. On the contrary, the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">INS</span> found that the issues raised in both proceedings were the same, whereas the Arbitrator in this case found that the issues in the ULP and grievance proceedings were, in part, different. Accordingly, we find that the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, VAMC</span>, <span class="Italic">INS</span>, and <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we reject the Agency's remaining assertions that the issue raised by the grievance was necessarily addressed by the Regional Director in the ULP proceedings and that allowing the grievance to proceed will permit the grievant to relitigate the issue of retaliation. We stated previously that the ULP charge alleged in relevant part that the Agency violated the Statute by proposing to suspend the grievant in retaliation for her Union activities and that the charge did not allege any separate contractual violation. We also stated that the Arbitrator addressed only that portion of the grievance alleging, through reference to Article 45, Section 45.01, that the suspension was not taken for sufficient cause as will promote the efficiency of the Federal service and did not address the portion of the grievance alleging retaliation. As we have found that the ULP charge and the relevant portion of the grievance addressed by the Arbitrator clearly concerned different issues, we reject the Agency's remaining assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another case involving a suspension, the agency issued an order restricting the use of the grievant's official time. A ULP was filed as to the order. The grievant was then suspended for violating the order and the case proceeded to arbitration. The arbitrator refused to consider the legitimacy of the order because that had been raised in the ULP case. FLRA sent the case back to the arbitrator because the legal theory differed in the ULP and grievance cases, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2096 and Dept. of Air Force, 20th Space Control Squadron</span>, 67 FLRA 30, 31 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for an issue raised in a grievance to be barred from consideration under &#x00A7; 7116(d) by an earlier-filed ULP charge: (1) the issue that is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue that is the subject matter of the ULP; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the ULP procedures; and (3) the selection of the ULP procedures must have been at the discretion of the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., N. Chi., Ill.</span>, 52 FLRA 387, 392 (1996). In determining whether a grievance and a ULP charge involve the same issue, the Authority examines whether the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances and whether the legal theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 39293.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the ULP charged that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a) of the Statute by issuing the order. The grievance, on the other hand, challenged the validity of the grievant's suspension, alleging in part that the suspension was not for just cause because the order on which the suspension was based violated Article 5.8 of the parties' agreement. Because the ULP alleged that issuance of the order violated the Statute and the grievance alleged that issuance of the order violated the parties' agreement, and because there is no claim that the pertinent agreement provision mirrors the Statute, we find that the legal theories underlying the ULP charge and the grievance are not substantially similar. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 112, 115 (2003) (Member Armendariz dissenting) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (finding that &#x00A7; 7116(d) did not apply because the ULP charge alleged a statutory violation and the grievance alleged a contractual violation). Therefore, the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7116(d), and we set it aside, because the Arbitrator incorrectly found that the issue of the validity of the order was barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Indian Health Serv., Alaska Area Native Health Servs., Anchorage, Alaska</span>, 56 FLRA 535, 538 (2000) (finding that the grievance was not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) because the ULP and the grievance were based on different legal theories). Because the Arbitrator addressed the merits of the grievant's suspension without considering the validity of the order, we remand this matter for resubmission to the <span id="page_1706"></span>Arbitrator, absent settlement, to reconsider the grievant's suspension in light of our decision that &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not preclude the Arbitrator from determining whether the order violates the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Human Res. Command, St. Louis, Mo.,</span> 64 FLRA 140, 144 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of the how different theories avoid a bar to a grievance is <span class="Italic">DOD, DCAA, Northeastern Region, Lexington and AFGE Council of Locals 163</span>, 47 FLRA 1314, 1320-21 (1993). At issue was denial of official time. The arbitrator considered a grievance claiming the denial violated the contract. A ULP charge was filed claiming that the denial interfered with union activity. FLRA concluded the grievance was not barred:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator compared the allegation contained in the ULP charge in Case No.&#x2003;BN-CA-20173 with the issue framed in the grievance and found that the legal issues presented in the ULP charge and grievance were different. We agree. Although the ULP charge and the grievance both arose from the Agency's denial of the Union official's requests for official time, the legal theories advanced in the cases are different. The theory advanced in the grievance was that the Agency should not have denied the Union official's requests for official time for work relating to the preparation and investigation of ULP cases because the parties' collective bargaining agreement provides for official time in those circumstances. Therefore, the issue presented for resolution in the grievance was whether the parties' contract provides for official time under the specific circumstances. On the other hand, the theory of the ULP charge was that the Agency should not have denied the official time requests because denying the requests constituted discrimination against the Union and unlawful interference with Union activity in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. Thus, the issue presented by the ULP charge was whether the Agency's conduct constituted unlawful discrimination and interference within the meaning of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the theory advanced in the grievance involved solely a question of contract interpretation and application, whereas the theory advanced in the ULP charge concerned a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute based on discriminatory treatment of the Union and unlawful interference with Union activity, we find that the issues in the two proceedings are clearly different. Specifically, the grievance involved whether the official time provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement entitled Union officials to official time for certain activities, while the ULP charge alleged an interference with the Union's statutory rights....&#8197;Accordingly, we find that section 7116(d) of the Statute did not bar the grievance in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the grievances filed by the Union were not based on the same factual circumstances that were involved in the ULP charges, and, consequently, the factual predicates in the two matters were not the same....&#8197;In resolving the three grievances numbered C-216-G-001, C-216-G-002, and C-216-G-003, filed on April 1, May 7, and May 14, 1992, respectively, the Arbitrator stated that the issue presented by the grievances was "[w]hether or not the Agency breached Article 22 of the [collective bargaining agreement] and the memorandum of understanding dated April 29, 1991[,] by terminating negotiations in September[&#8197;] 1991 and by implementing the performance appraisal plans in April[&#8197;] 1992."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the ULP charges did not concern the Agency's implementation of the performance appraisal plans in April 1992. The issue in the ULP charge in Case No. WA-CA-20145, filed by the Union on December 3, 1991, was whether the Agency had committed a ULP by violating Article 22 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and the memorandum of understanding dated April 29, 1991, when it failed "to meet and confer...to collaboratively develop a new performance appraisal system, including but not limited to critical job elements and standards." Similarly, the issue in the ULP charge in Case No. WA-CA-20284, filed by the Union on January 23, 1992, was whether the Agency committed a ULP when it "refused to continue bargaining with the National Council of EEOC Locals #216 over the substance and/or the impact and implementation of the Agency's [p]erformance [a]ppraisal [s]ystem covering all bargaining unit employees." The ULP charges do not allege that the Agency committed a ULP by actually implementing a performance appraisal system, and indeed, could not have contained such an allegation because the Agency had not implemented a performance appraisal system at the time the ULP charges were filed. The factual situation facing the Union at the time the grievances were filed was different from the situation facing the Union at the time the ULP charges were filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 72. Thus, it is clear that the underlying factual circumstances of the ULP charges and the grievances were not the same for purposes of applying section 7116(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that the underlying legal theories in the ULP charges and the grievances were not the same.&#x2003;In the ULP charges, the Union objected to the Agency's failure to negotiate over PARS. Specifically, in Case No. WA-CA-20145, the Union alleged that the Agency "negotiated Article 22 of the [collective bargaining agreement] and the MOU in bad faith." In Case No. WA-CA-20284, the Union alleged that the Agency's failure to bargain "over the substance and/or the impact and implementation of the Agency's Performance Appraisal System" violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, in the consolidated grievances, the issues framed by the Arbitrator concerned whether the Agency breached provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and the memorandum of understanding by terminating negotiations in September 1991 and by implementing the performance appraisal plans in April 1992. Thus, the grievances are based on a theory not contained in the ULP charges--that the Agency had improperly implemented the performance appraisal plan. Consequently, the Union's underlying legal theory in the ULP charges is not the same as the underlying legal theory in the grievances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 824 F.2d at 72; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Contract Audit Agency, Northeastern Region, Lexington, Massachusetts and AFGE, Council of Locals 163</span>, 47 FLRA 1314, 1320-21 (1993) (where the legal theory advanced in the grievance involved solely a question of contract interpretation and application, whereas the theory advanced in the ULP charge concerned a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute based on discriminatory treatment of the union and unlawful interference with union activity, the issues in the two proceedings were different for purposes of section 7116(d)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the grievance is barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute because it raises the same issues as an earlier-filed ULP charge. In order for a grievance to be precluded under &#x00A7; 7116(d) by an earlier-filed ULP charge: (1) the issue that is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue that is the subject matter of the unfair labor practice charge; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedure; and (3) the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures must have been in the discretion of the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, Norfolk Dist., Army Corps of Eng'rs, Norfolk, Va.</span>, 59 FLRA 906, 909 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims the grievance is barred because the subject matter of the grievance is the same as the subject matter of the earlier-filed ULP. Specifically, the Agency argues that Articles III and XII were raised as grounds for the Union's claims in both the grievance and the ULP. Although the Agency is correct that the Union relies on Articles III and XII in both proceedings, the factual circumstances underlying the Union's reliance on these provisions in each proceeding are different. In this regard, there is no dispute that the Union's ULP charge concerns actions that occurred prior to the RIF, while the grievance concerns the Agency's actions in implementing the RIF. Specifically, the ULP charge alleges that the Agency violated the Statute by not providing the Union with certain information, by not bargaining over VSIP buyouts, and by not consulting the Union before changing conditions of employment. Conversely, the grievance alleges that the RIF was a sham and that the Agency made numerous errors implementing the RIF in connection with job placements.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the grievance alleges the Agency violated the parties' agreement by not providing employees who had received RIF notices copies of the retention registers. Although this issue <span id="page_1707"></span>is similar to the Union's ULP charge that the Agency repudiated the parties' agreement by not providing the Union with retention registers, it is not factually the same. In this regard, the ULP concerns the Agency's alleged failure to provide the Union with retention registers before any RIF notices were issued, while the grievance concerns an alleged failure to provide employees with retention registers after individual RIF notices were issued. As such, the grievance is not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). <span class="Italic">See LOC</span>, 58 FLRA 486. In any event, the Arbitrator did not resolve the issue of whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement by failing to provide retention registers to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the grievance and the ULP arise under different factual circumstances and legal theories, we find that the grievance is not barred by the earlier-filed ULP, and we deny the Agency's exception.<span class="Italic"> See Library of Congress</span>, 58 FLRA 486, 488 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting on other grounds) (<span class="Italic">LOC</span>) (grievance that arose under different factual circumstances as an earlier-filed ULP not barred); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C., </span>59 FLRA 112 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (Member Armendariz dissenting) (grievance not barred by earlier-filed ULP where legal theories raised in each proceeding were different).</p>

The Arbitrator concluded that the grievance was not barred by the earlier-filed ULP charge under &#x00A7; 7116(d) because they are factually distinct.

<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's finding that the grievance concerned "a different request, in a different year, for different information" is a nonfact, we defer to it. And based upon this finding, we conclude that the Arbitrator did not err by finding that the grievance, which concerned the Agency's denial of a request for documents that arose <span class="Italic">after</span> the facts giving rise to the ULP charge, is not barred by the earlier-filed ULP charge under &#x00A7; 7116(d).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievance and the ULP rest on different legal theories. The grievance alleges that the Agency did not have just cause to suspend the grievant under Article 20 of the parties' agreement. The ULP charge alleges that the supervisor's instructions constituted unlawful unilateral changes in conditions of employment under the Statute. Because the grievance rests on a contract theory and the ULP charge rests on a statutory theory, the grievance was not barred by section 7116(d) of the Statute.</p>

The court in <span class="Italic">Local 1411</span> explained that, unlike <span class="Italic">Local 1411</span>, <span class="Italic">OEA</span> "did not depend upon the distinction...between proposed and actual agency action." <span class="Italic">Local 1411</span>, 960 F.2d at 178.

<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, in this case the legal theories underlying the ULP and the grievance are different.

A ULP was filed complaining of the failure to bargain over the impact of the experiment. A grievance was filed to protest claimed violations of the negotiated agreement, specifically, that the program was not implemented uniformly throughout the country and compromised the OSHA inspectors. The grievance was not barred. The ULP concerned bargaining rights, and the grievance concerned <span id="page_1708"></span>contract rights not involving bargaining obligations. A particular set of facts may give rise to a refusal to bargain problem, as well as a dispute whether management violated substantive contract provisions. In <span class="Italic">DOL,</span> Section 7116(d) only prohibited duplicate filings of an issue actually raised in the grievance and ULP forums; it did not extend to an issue that the aggrieved party could have, but did not, raise in the earlier selected forum. On a common set of facts, it was permissible for the union to file a ULP charge over a unilateral change in practice in overtime assignment that constituted an improper refusal to bargain, and to grieve another aspect of management's action, elimination of existing overtime balances, as a violation of the substantive provisions of the contract. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 40</span>, 18 FLRA 412, 414 (1985). Still, identical issues cannot be pursued under both procedures.

<p class="noindent">Issues having but a peripheral connection are not the same for purposes of &#x00A7; 7116(d).

<p class="noindent-1">The threshold question in this case is whether the complaint is barred by the second sentence of section 7116(d), which provides in pertinent part: "...issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice...but not under both procedures."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have developed a test for determining whether issues raised in a grievance proceeding are the same as the issues that are raised in an unfair labor practice proceeding, relying on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 72 (D.C. Cir. 1987).

<p class="noindent-2">For a grievance to be precluded under section 7116(d) by an earlier-filed unfair labor practice charge: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the unfair labor practice; (2) such issue must have been earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedures; and (3) the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures must have been in the discretion of the aggrieved party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Only the first of the three elements is at issue in this case.&#x2003;With regard to the determination of whether the unfair labor practice charge and the grievance involve the same issue,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the Authority will look at whether the ULP charge and the grievance arose from the same set of factual circumstances and whether the theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar. (Citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts that three separate grievances involve the same issue that is raised as an unfair labor practice in this case, and points out that all were filed before the date of the filing of the unfair labor practice charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two of the grievances were filed July 14, 1989. Grievance I concerned the reprimand given to Wooten on June 22, 1989, for distributing Union publications to employees' workplaces on June 19, 20 and 21, while he was on official time, assertedly in violation of Article 12, Section 2 of the negotiated agreement. The grievance sought retraction of the reprimand "as to [Wooten's] alleged violation of Article 12, Sec. 2 of the National Contract."...&#8197;The basis for the grievance was that management had circumvented the negotiated agreement "by personally charging the Union Representative for conduct that could only be chargeable against the Union since Art. 12 National Contract only applies to Union-Management disagreement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Grievance II concerned the Respondent's alleged failure to notify the Union in advance of employee rotations, specifically referring to "Article 24 and any other available articles of the National Agreement." The request to distribute that grievance to the employees, which led to the unfair labor practice complaint in this proceeding, was attached to the grievance on a separate sheet.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Grievance III was filed on August 18, 1989. Grievance III concerned the Respondent's answer to the Union's inquiry as to whether the July 14 memorandum was an "internal union publication" that could not be distributed at the workplace on duty time under Article 12, Section 2A of the negotiated agreement....&#8197;Thus, the dispute in Grievance III related only to the interpretation of a specific term of Article 12, Section 2A.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts underlying the unfair labor practice allegation also concern the Respondent's refusal to permit the Union on July 14 to distribute the memorandum. However, the theory of the alleged unfair labor practice is that the refusal to permit distribution of the July 14 memorandum violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because the Union was prohibited from making a distribution during work time to duty stations, while numerous other non-union distributions had been permitted under similar circumstances. In other words, the General Counsel maintains that the Respondent violated the Statute because it treated the Union disparately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievances, on the other hand, involved specifically only the meaning of various articles of the negotiated agreement and, to some extent, earlier incidents. Grievance I involved whether the Agency could give an oral warning to Wooten, in his capacity as an employee, for distributing documents allegedly in violation of Article 12, Section 2A. Grievance II concerned alleged violations of the negotiated agreement regarding the Respondent's alleged failure to notify the Union in advance of employee rotations. We conclude that the factual bases of Grievance I and Grievance II do not involve the same subject matter as that of the alleged unfair labor practice. Therefore, the issues are different for the purposes of section 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, Grievance III questioned whether the material the Union sought to distribute was an official publication of the Union within the meaning of Article 12, Section 2A. Grievance III sought to require that before the Union would be prohibited from making distributions in the future, the Respondent should "make sure that all such materials meet the criteria of section 2 A."...&#8197;We conclude that although Grievance III and the unfair labor practice allegation both arose from the Respondent's conduct in prohibiting distribution of the July 14 memorandum, the issues involved are completely different. The theory of Grievance III was that the Respondent should not have prohibited the Union's distribution because the Respondent did not first show that the material was an official publication within the meaning of the contract, whereas the theory of the unfair labor practice charge was that the Respondent should not have prohibited the Union's distribution because doing so constituted disparate treatment in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. Put simply, the grievance sought to establish a solely contractual right to distribute the material, based upon a specific provision of the collective bargaining agreement, while this proceeding seeks to establish a statutory basis for that right, based on discriminatory treatment of the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we conclude that this unfair labor practice proceeding is not barred by section 7116(d) of the Statute....</p>

Although the arbitrator addressed both the adverse actions and the security measures through a remedial order, the case was also brought as a ULP to FLRA based on the imposition of the security procedures (the adverse actions themselves would not have been reviewable by FLRA because of the election procedure of 5 USC 7121(f), reserving adverse action review procedures to the Federal Circuit). FLRA concluded it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the ULP:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I. Statement of the Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on exceptions to the attached decision of the Administrative Law Judge filed by the Charging Party.&#x2003;The Respondents Human Resources Command (HRC) and Information Support Activity (ISA) filed an opposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The consolidated, amended complaints allege that Respondent ISA issued proposed removals of the Charging Party's president and chief steward that were motivated by their protected activities. The complaints also allege that both Respondents directed that the employees' tours of duty be fixed at 7:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 4:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>, that they be barred from their official duty locations, that they report daily to the union office, and that they be accompanied by military escorts at all times while in the Respondents' facilities. The complaints allege that, by this conduct, the Respondents violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (2), and (4) of the Federal Service Labor-Management<span id="page_1709"></span> Relations Statute (the Statute). The Judge recommended that the Authority dismiss the complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Judge erred in determining that the &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) and (4) allegations are barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute, and we remand for a decision on the merits. We defer resolution of the independent &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) allegation pending that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background and Judge's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent ISA proposed to remove the chief steward on the basis of four charges: (1) fraudulently receiving pay for work not performed; (2) absence without leave (AWOL); (3) falsifying official time sheets; and (4) lying during an investigation. Respondent ISA proposed to remove the president on the basis of five charges: (1) fraudulently obtaining entitlements; (2) failing to request leave properly; (3) AWOL; (4) falsifying official time sheets; and (5) lying during an investigation. The Charging Party filed unfair labor practice (ULP) charges, which alleged that the proposed removals were motivated by the employees' protected activities. The charges also alleged that both Respondents unlawfully directed that the employees' tours of duty be fixed at 7:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 4:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>, that they be barred from their official duty locations, that they report daily to the union office, and that they be accompanied by military escorts at all times while in the Respondents' facilities. The General Counsel issued amended complaints, which were consolidated, and alleged that, by this conduct, the Respondents violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (2), and (4). Both complaints also alleged that, by this conduct, Respondents independently violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, Respondent ISA removed both employees on the basis of all of the charges against them, and each employee filed a grievance, which was denied by Respondent ISA. The removal grievances were consolidated and submitted to arbitration. An arbitrator issued separate awards that sustained the grievances, in part. As to the chief steward, the arbitrator found that Respondent ISA had failed to prove the charges of falsifying official time sheets, fraudulently receiving pay, and lying during an investigation. The arbitrator mitigated the removal to a 30-day suspension. As to the president, the arbitrator found that Respondent ISA had failed to prove the charges of falsifying official time sheets, fraudulently receiving pay, failing to request leave properly, and being AWOL. The arbitrator mitigated the removal to a 15-day suspension. The arbitrator also ordered Respondent ISA to immediately terminate the military escort and confinement policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge first considered whether any issues raised in the complaints were barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) as issues that could properly be raised under an appeals procedure. The Judge concluded that the &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) and (4) allegations ((a)(2) and (4) allegations) were barred, but that the independent &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) allegation (independent (a)(1) allegation) was not barred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In examining the (a)(2) and (4) allegations, the Judge noted that, once the Respondent ISA issued the removal decisions, the Authority no longer had jurisdiction over the proposed removals, and the General Counsel had amended the complaint to reflect the lack of jurisdiction. However, the Judge examined whether the security measures and restrictions that were placed on the employees at the time of their proposed removals were matters separable from their removals. According to the Judge, if the security measures and restrictions were not separable from the removals, then the (a)(2) and (4) allegations were barred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge concluded that the security measures and restrictions were inseparable from the removals because they were "clearly bound up with the [removal] actions." In so concluding, the Judge relied on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Naval Resale Activity, Guam,</span> 40 FLRA 30 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Naval Resale Activity</span>). The Judge stated that, although the grievances did not specifically raise the matter of the security measures and restrictions, the measures and restrictions were part of the factual matters presented to the arbitrator. In addition, the Judge viewed the security measures to be "the direct result of the [removal] actions and any discussion of those measures returns to the basis of the [removal] actions themselves. Finally, the Judge addressed whether the Authority has jurisdiction because the ULP focused on the Charging Party's institutional interests rather than on the rights of the employees. The Judge found that the Authority did not have jurisdiction on this basis because the (a)(2) and (4) allegations did not focus on the Charging Party's institutional interests. Consequently, the Judge concluded that the (a)(2) and (4) allegations were barred as issues that could properly be raised under an appeals procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the independent (a)(1) allegation, the Judge found that the allegation was not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). In contrast to the focus of the (a)(2) and (4) allegations, the Judge found that the focus of the independent (a)(1) allegation was on the Charging Party's institutional interests. Addressing the merits of the independent (a)(1) allegation, the Judge concluded that the security measures and restrictions did not interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights under the Statute. The Judge recognized that the standard for determining interference with, or restraint or coercion of, employees in the pursuit of protected rights is an objective one: "[W]hether, under the circumstances, the statement or conduct would tend to coerce or intimidate the employee, or whether the employee could reasonably have drawn a coercive inference from the statement [or conduct]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding no violation, the Judge stated that, once the chief steward and the president lost their security badges, they no longer had free access to the facilities. The Judge noted that both the General Counsel and the Charging Party claimed that the usual practice was to use civilian escorts. However, the Judge found that the General Counsel and the Charging Party did not address the testimony of the commanding officer of</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent HRC that she used military personnel because of the logistical problems of using civilian personnel to be escorts and guards on a daily basis.&#x2003;The Judge found this testimony to be "unrefuted and compelling." The Judge also stated that there was no indication that civilian escorts would have been satisfactory to the General Counsel or the Charging Party. In addition, she found no evidence that: (1) unit employees were aware of the presence of the military escorts when they were stationed in the Union office; (2) employees were unable to seek the assistance of the Union; or (3) the chief steward or the president expressed any specific concern to the Respondents (other than initial filing the ULP charges). The Judge further found that "the escort policy is clearly a security issue reserved to management under [&#x00A7;] 7106(a)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under all of these circumstances, the Judge concluded that the security measures and restrictions during the notice period of proposed removals did not have a chilling effect on unit employees so as to constitute an independent violation of (a)(1). In so concluding, the Judge noted that unit employees work with the military on a regular basis and found that the use of military escorts was not a substantial departure from the use of civilian escorts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Judge erred in concluding that the (a)(2) and (4) allocations are barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Interpretation and Application of &#x00A7; 7116(d)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) provides, in the first sentence, that "[i]ssues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices[.]" In determining whether an issue is barred by this provision, the Authority examines whether the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the MSPB appeal or grievance and whether the legal theories advanced in support of the ULP charge and the MSPB appeal or grievance are substantially similar. When they are, the Authority concludes that the ULP allegation is barred. <span class="Italic">E.g., Bureau of the Census,</span> 41 FLRA 436, 446-47 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd sub nom. Dep't of Commerce, Bureau of the Census v. FLRA,</span> 976 F.2d 882 (4th Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Commerce</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census,</span> the Authority concluded that a ULP allegation was not barred by the first sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 437. The employee in that case had filed a ULP charge, and the General Counsel had issued a complaint, over a record of infraction and a letter of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the respondent removed the employee, the employee filed a grievance over the removal. The Authority ruled that, because the record of infraction and letter of proposed removal could not be appealed to the MSPB, the complaint was not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 446-47. The court in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Commerce</span> reversed the Authority, ruling that the challenge to the record of infraction and letter of proposed removal and the challenge to the removal were inseparable and that the complaint was barred. 976 F.2d at 888. In this regard, the court emphasized that, although the MSPB cannot adjudicate ULP complaints, facts underlying ULP charges can be challenged in the MSPB process as prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 890.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">SBA, aff'd in part, rev'd in part sub nom. Wildberger,</span> the Authority clarified that, when the factual predicate of the ULP allegation and the grievance or MSPB appeal is the same and the legal theory of the ULP allegation is within the jurisdiction of the MSPB, the Authority will determine that there is no jurisdiction over the ULP allegation on the basis of &#x00A7; 7116(d). 51 FLRA at 421-22. The Authority emphasized that it would apply this approach only in cases when the matter raised as a ULP ripens into, or is inseparable from, a matter appealable to the MSPB. In addition, the Authority stated that it would continue to assert jurisdiction when the ULP allegation focuses on a union's institutional interests rather than on the rights of employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 422. Applying this clarified approach, the Authority determined that all three complaints in SBA were barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 422-25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal of <span class="Italic">SBA,</span> the court in <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span> affirmed that a ULP allegation is barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d) when the following circumstances are present: (1) the employee has raised all of the issues that underlie the ULP in a grievance or MSPB appeal; (2) these issues are within the MSPB's jurisdiction; and (3) the arbitrator or the MSPB has not declined jurisdiction over any of these issues. 132 F.3d at 790. The court held that the Authority had <span id="page_1710"></span>correctly applied &#x00A7; 7116(d) to two of the three complaints, but that, because the MSPB never addressed the theory raised in the remaining complaint, which alleged disparate treatment, the Authority had erroneously determined that this complaint was barred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 794. The court emphasized that &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars Authority jurisdiction over ULP charges only if the same issues were considered by the MSPB or arbitrator as affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 792. The court also emphasized that its holding was narrowly tailored and did not address the proper application of &#x00A7; 7116(d) when the specified circumstances were not present. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 790-91.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the court in <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span> stated that its decision should not be interpreted to mean that all ULP charges involving an employee who subsequently appeals an adverse action to arbitration or the MSPB "should necessarily be subsumed" in the grievance or MSPB appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 795. The court stated that, in such a case, the Authority must resolve whether the ULP charge "could be or should be subsumed" into the grievance or MSPB appeal or whether, instead, the charge and the grievance or MSPB appeal are sufficiently separate that the Authority has jurisdiction over the charge notwithstanding the grievance or MSPB appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also stated that its decision was "not intended as either an endorsement or a rejection of the Fourth Circuit's holding in [<span class="Italic">Dep't of Commerce</span>]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Application of &#x00A7; 7116(d) to the (a)(2) and (4) allegations</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span> and <span class="Italic">Dep't of Commerce,</span> the Authority's analytical framework for determining jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7116(d) is to examine whether the factual predicate of the ULP charge is the same as the factual predicate of the MSPB appeal or grievance and whether the legal theory advanced to support the ULP and the grievance or MSPB appeal is substantially similar. Applying this analytical framework, we conclude that the factual predicate of the grievances over the removal actions and the factual predicate of the ULP charge over the imposition of the security measures and restrictions are different and that, therefore, the (a)(2) and (4) allegations are not barred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The factual predicate of the grievances before the arbitrator was the removal of the chief steward and the president on the basis of the specified charges.&#x2003;In imposing the security measures and restrictions, Respondent ISA did not rely on any of the specified charges for removal. Instead, the expressed basis of the security measures and restrictions was a need to protect government property and the past volatile behavior of both of the employees. In addition, the evidence presented to the Judge confirmed that no other employees who received a notice of proposed removal were required to be escorted by military personnel and to be confined to one office. Consequently, proposed removals do not directly result in the imposition of security measures and restrictions. This demonstrates that, contrary to the finding of the Judge, the removals and the security measures and restrictions are separable and that the complaints are not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). <span class="Italic">See Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA,</span> 824 F.2d 61, 72 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (factual predicates were different because the situations and corresponding actions confronting the aggrieved party were different); <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n,</span> 48 FLRA 822, 829 (1993) (factual situation underlying the grievance was different from the factual situation underlying the ULP). Moreover, because Respondent ISA did not rely specifically on any of the specified charges for removal in imposing the security measures, consideration of the security measures does not "return[&#8197;] to the basis of the [removal] actions themselves[,]" as found by the Judge. Furthermore, although the (a)(2) and (4) allegations focus on the president and chief steward, as found by the Judge, the allegations also implicate the Union's institutional interests that are conceptually separate and distinct from the individual interests raised by the removal grievances. <span class="Italic">See 305th Air Mobility Wing, McGuire Air Force Base, N.J.,</span> 54 FLRA 1243, 1261-62 (1998) (ALJ decision) (every &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) violation implicates an institutional interest of a labor organization). Therefore, we conclude that the (a)(2) and (a)(4) allegations are not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the (a)(2) and (4) allegations are not barred, we have applied the decisions in both <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span> and <span class="Italic">Dep't of Commerce.</span> Consistent with <span class="Italic">Wildberger,</span> the allegations are not barred because, although the security measures and restrictions were mentioned in the grievances and the arbitrator's awards, similar to the disparate treatment complaint remanded by the court in <span class="Italic">Wildberger,</span> the security measures and restrictions were not addressed by the arbitrator, and these issues were not necessary to the arbitrator's resolution of the removal grievances. Moreover, for the reasons already discussed, we find no basis for concluding that the allegations should have been subsumed into the removal grievances. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Dep't of Commerce,</span> the allegations are not barred because the challenge to the security measures and restrictions and the challenge to the removals are not inseparable. In addition, unlike <span class="Italic">Dep't of Commerce,</span> it is not clear that the facts underlying the (a)(2) and (4) allegations can be challenged in the MSPB process as prohibited personnel practices. In this regard, the security measures and restrictions do not appear to be appealable personnel actions, the legality of which can properly be challenged before the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Barnes v. Small,</span> 840 F.2d 972, 981 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (MSPB's jurisdiction to reverse agency actions that are not in accordance with law does not "give the MSPB authority to administer a body of law entrusted...to the exclusive jurisdiction of the FLRA.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that, in concluding that the security measures and restrictions were "clearly bound up" with the removal grievances, the Judge relied on <span class="Italic">Naval Resale Activity.</span> However, <span class="Italic">Naval Resale Activity</span> interpreted and applied the jurisdictional bar of &#x00A7; 7122(a), not &#x00A7; 7116(d), and the Authority addressed the question of whether the award "relat[ed] to a matter described in [&#x00A7;] 7121(f)[.]" [3] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). As the Authority advised in <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census,</span> which rejected reliance on case law under &#x00A7; 7122(a), a ULP complaint under &#x00A7; 7116(d) is not barred "simply because it 'relates to' a matter that is the subject of an appeals procedure." 41 FLRA at 448. Consequently, the Judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Resale</span> <span class="Italic">Activity</span> was misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Section 7122(a) provides that exceptions may not be filed, to an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in [&#x00A7;] 7121(f)[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the (a)(2) and (4) allegations are not barred by the first sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d). We remand these allegations for a decision on the merits because the record is insufficient to resolve whether the Respondents violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) and (4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Olam Southwest Air Defense Sector and NAGE Local R12-85</span>, 51 FLRA 797, 801-07 (1996), employees grieved a scheduling change as unfair; their grievances were processed by the union through the grievance process. The union filed a ULP because the scheduling changes were implemented without bargaining. No election was required:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second sentence of section 7116(d) of the Statute governs whether a ULP is barred by a previously-filed grievance.[5] Pursuant to this provision, an aggrieved party has an option of raising certain issues [6] under a grievance procedure or as a ULP charge, "but not under both procedures." [7] As stated by the U.S. Supreme Court, this statutory scheme precludes the same aggrieved party from raising "identical issues" under both procedures, but does not "preclude a union in its institutional capacity as an aggrieved party from filing an unfair labor practice charge to enforce its own independent rights merely because an employee has initiated an appeal or grievance procedure, based on the same factual situation, to enforce his individual rights." <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 665 n.20 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The same provision also applies to determining whether a ULP charge bars a subsequently-filed grievance. The Authority's approach to determining whether a bar exists under section 7116(d) applies in the same way without regard to which action is filed first.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Excepted from this requirement are matters wherein, under section 7121(e) and (f) the Statute, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Contrary to the Respondent's assertion that the Authority requires "that the parties be the same in both the grievance and the unfair labor practice[,]," the Authority requires only that both actions be initiated at the discretion of the aggrieved party. In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176, 177-78 (D.C. Cir. 1992), for example, the court sustained the Authority's decision that a ULP charge filed by the union barred a subsequent grievance filed by an individual employee where both actions rested on the same factual predicate and alleged the same statutory and contractual violations. There is no dispute in this case that both the second-step grievance and the ULP charge were filed in the discretion of the same aggrieved parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In each case, the determination whether a ULP charge is barred by an earlier-filed grievance requires examining whether "the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the theory advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Army Finance and Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411</span>, 38 FLRA 1345, 1351 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Army Finance), petition for review denied sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176, 177-78 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Local 1411</span>). Only if both requirements are satisfied is a subsequent action barred by a former one. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Overseas</span> <span class="Italic">Education Association v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 72-73 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>), the court, affirming the Authority, concluded that a ULP charge alleging discrimination in management's proposal to eliminate a position held by a union official, and a grievance protesting that official's notice of dismissal, were based on different theories. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 72-73. Similarly, the Authority has found that the filing of a ULP charge did not bar a subsequently-filed grievance where the theory advanced in the ULP was that the grievant's proposed suspension violated the Statute because it was based on retaliation for participation in union activities and the theory advanced in the grievance was that the suspension violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement because it was not <span id="page_1711"></span>taken for just and sufficient cause. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Council of EEOC Locals No. 216 and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 49 FLRA 906, 914-15 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, in <span class="Italic">Local 1411</span>, 960 F.2d at 178, the court held in agreement with the Authority that, in contrast to <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, a ULP charge barred a subsequently-filed grievance where the grievance rested on the same factual predicate and alleged the same statutory and contract violations. In another case, the Authority similarly found that a ULP charge and a grievance were based on the same theory where the ULP alleged that the activity violated the Statute by proposing to discipline the grievance based on reprisal for engaging in union activities and the grievance alleged that the suspension "constituted harassment of the grievant for his union activities." <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3690</span>, 18 FLRA 314, 315 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case now before us, it is undisputed that the grievance and the ULP arose from the same set of factual circumstances. The issue is whether the "theory advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar." <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>, 38 FLRA at 1351. If the theories are not substantially similar, section 7116(d) compels a conclusion that the ULP is not barred by the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the theory advanced in support of the grievance, the ALJ found that the second-step grievance "addresse[d] only preferential treatment afforded to some employees." An examination of the grievance itself confirms the ALJ's finding. The grievance consists of a form and an attachment, which explains the nature of the grievants' complaint. In the attachment, the Union representative filing the grievance asserts that the purpose of the grievance was to "convinc[e]" a representative of the Respondent to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">grant [the grievants] the opportunity [the Respondent] ha[d] so obligingly allowed the employees who work straight days to do. This is to select between four work schedules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union representative referenced "the segregation the [grievants] felt":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It does not stem from the fact they are the only twenty-four hour manned duty section. It stems from the fact [that] all other installation employees are allowed to make choices in their available work schedules and the Radar work center employees are not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's recognition that the grievance concerned discrimination against the grievants is clear from the Station Manager's denial of the grievance, in which he concluded that he had found "no evidence of discrimination between employees who work uncommon tours of duty and those who do not[.]" The denial of the grievance does not refer to the Statute and does not discuss the issue of whether the Respondent was required to bargain with the Union before changing crew assignments. Although the grievance states as a fact that the Respondent "altered the personnel crew schedules as some employees were moved to other crews[,]" the grievance does not raise or mention any issues concerning the Agency's failure to notify or bargain with the Union before implementing the changes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the theory advanced in support of the ULP charge, the ALJ found that the charge asserted only that the crew changes violated the Statute because they were implemented without an opportunity for the Union to bargain over them. We agree that the charge encompassed only this theory. More particularly, the charge includes no mention of preferential treatment, and states only that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On 14 February 1992, the Activity implemented crew personnel changes in the Radar work center without consulting in good faith and/or affording the Union the opportunity to negotiate at its request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that section 7116(d) bars the ULP because both the grievance and the ULP requested bargaining as remedies. First, the record does not establish that the grievance and the ULP requested bargaining over the same matters and, even if bargaining is ultimately ordered by both tribunals, there is no reason to conclude that such bargaining will result in a redundant or even overlapping remedy.[11] Second, even assuming that the remedy sought in both fora are the same, the Agency has provided no support, and none is apparent, for the proposition that actions seeking the same remedy present the same issue under the second sentence in section 7116(d) and/or substantially similar theories under the Authority's <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> test.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;In the grievance, the Union requested bargaining over selections for "crew schedule[s]." In the ULP charge, on the other hand, the Union objected to the Agency's alleged failure to bargain over "crew personnel" changes. As the only changes effected by the Respondent related to crew pairings, not hours of work, it would be reasonable to read the reference to "crew personnel" in the ULP charge as encompassing only assignments of affected employees to pairs. It is unclear whether the different wording in the grievance indicates that bargaining over different matters was requested. Specifically, in view of the grievance's reference to the four work schedules available to other of Respondent's personnel, the "crew schedule" bargaining referred to therein could be read as encompassing various hours-of-work schedules.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;It is axiomatic that the same remedy may be awarded as a result of pursuing a myriad of legal theories. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Helena District and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 42</span>, 37 FLRA 1410, 1422 (1990) (Back pay ordered as remedy for race and national origin discrimination);<span class="Italic"> U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Dallas, Texas and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 140</span>, 37 FLRA 1022, 1026 (1990) (Back pay ordered as remedy for reprisal taken against employees for whistleblowing activities); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1698 and Department of the Navy, Aviation Supply Office</span>, 34 FLRA 939, 943 (1990) (Back pay ordered as a remedy for the violation of a collective bargaining agreement); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1915 and Wm.

Even though back pay was ordered as a remedy in all of these cases, each case advanced a different issue and proceeded on a distinct legal theory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the record supports the Judge's conclusion that the theories in the grievance and the ULP charge are different. The issue in the grievance was whether "Radar Center employees were being segregated, or discriminated against, by not being able to choose their own schedules." This is clearly a different theory than that advanced in the ULP charge. As the Judge found, "there would be no need for the arbitrator to address the unfair labor practice issue" because the "grievance sought only to establish preferential treatment to employees, while the [ULP] sought to establish a statutory violation of Respondent's failure to bargain a change in working conditions." As the legal theories are different, the ALJ's conclusion that the ULP charge was not barred by the grievance is fully consistent with, and compelled by, not only the plain wording of the Statute but also by judicial and Authority precedent interpreting and applying the Statute.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;We note that the Fourth Circuit also has interpreted section 7116(d) as encompassing an analysis of factual predicates and legal theory. <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Bureau</span> <span class="Italic">of the Census v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 889 (4th Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Commerce). Commerce</span> involved the first sentence of 7116(d). However, the court stated that the Authority's test under the second sentence, examining whether the two actions arose from the same set of facts and are based on the same legal theory, is "transferable[,]" 976 F.2d at 889, and the court applied that test to determining whether, under the first sentence of section 7116(d), an issue may be raised as a ULP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we find that the Respondent's reliance on the position argued by the Authority, and adopted by the court in <span class="Italic">Local 916</span> is misplaced. In that case, a union sought court review of the Authority's decision setting aside an arbitration award. 951 F.2d at 276. The court agreed with the Authority that, under section 7123(a)(1) of the Statute, which provides for judicial review of FLRA orders reviewing arbitration awards only where the orders involve a ULP, the court had no jurisdiction over the proceeding because it did not involve a ULP. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 278-79<span class="Italic">. Local 916</span> did not concern whether any subsequent ULP filed over the matter raised in the grievance would have been barred by section 7116(d); the court specifically held that the case did "not involve the duplication...prohibited by 7116(d)...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 279. The decision, and the Authority's decision reviewed therein, speak only to the fact that, whether or not the matter raised in the grievance could have been raised as a statutory ULP, the grievance itself did not raise a statutory ULP issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the latter point, there is no argument, or other basis on which to conclude, that, in the case now before us, the Union was prevented from raising in its grievance an allegation that the Agency's change in crew assignments violated the Statute. However, unlike the first sentence in section 7116(d), which precludes adjudication in a ULP proceeding of issues which "can properly be raised under an appeals procedure," whether or not they are in fact raised [14], the second sentence of section 7116(d), which is applicable here, states a different rule. It plainly precludes only subsequent litigation of issues that, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, were raised earlier. Accordingly, whether or not the Union could have raised statutory issues in its grievance, the fact remains that the Union did not do so. Accordingly, we conclude, in agreement with the ALJ, that the filing of the grievance did not bar the filing of the ULP charge under section 7116(d) of the Statute, and we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator erred in finding that &#x00A7; 7116(d) of the Statute did not bar the portion of the grievance that she resolved. As set forth above, &#x00A7; 7116(d) provides, in pertinent part, that "issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as [a ULP]..., but not under both procedures."[23] For almost thirty years, the Authority has held that this wording "precludes duplicate filings of an issue <span class="Italic">actually raised</span> in the grievance and [ULP] forums [but] does not extend to an issue [that] the aggrieved party could have, but did not, raise in [an] earlier[-]selected forum."[24] In particular, and as relevant here, in order for an earlier-filed ULP charge to bar a grievance under &#x00A7; 7116(d), the issue that is the subject matter of the grievance must be the same as the issue that is the subject matter of the ULP charge.[25] Using a test that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) has upheld,[26] the Authority will find that a grievance and a ULP charge involve the same issue when they arise from the same set of factual circumstances <span class="Italic">and</span> advance substantially similar legal theories.[27]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Of particular relevance to the latter requirement, the Authority has long held that an alleged statutory violation relies on a different legal theory than an alleged contract violation, and, as a result, a ULP charge alleging a violation of the Statute does not result in a &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar on a subsequent grievance alleging a breach of the parties' agreement.[28] Endorsing this distinction under &#x00A7; 7116(d), the D.C. Circuit has observed that it "would be strange indeed...to contend" that a ULP "charge concern[ing] a statutory violation" and a grievance alleging a "violation of [a] collective[&#8197;]bargaining agreement...present [an] identical issue."[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the earlier-filed ULP charge alleged violations of the Statute--but not the parties' agreement--while the portion of the grievance submitted for arbitration alleged only violations of the agreement. Although the Agency challenges the Arbitrator's &#x00A7; 7116(d) analysis by asserting that "the issue raised in the grievance was raised...[in the] ULP" charge, the Agency does not identify any contractual violations asserted in the ULP charge. Moreover, the record supports the Arbitrator's finding that the Union did not raise contractual violations in the ULP charge.[32] That is significant because the determination of whether &#x00A7; 7116(d) applies to the portion of the grievance before the Arbitrator depends on the content of the Union's earlier-filed ULP charge[33]--and <span class="Italic">not</span> on any subsequent analysis of the charge by the FLRA's Boston Regional Office, such as the dismissal letter's statement that the Agency "followed the rules in [Article 18 of the parties' agreement] for posting the new schedule." Indeed, the ULP charge does not mention the parties' agreement at all. Consistent with the standards set forth above, the Arbitrator correctly determined that the ULP charge and the portion of the grievance submitted to the Arbitrator involved different issues.[36] Therefore, the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator erred in finding that &#x00A7; 7116(d) did not bar her from addressing the contractual violations alleged in the portion of the grievance submitted for her resolution.[37]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we note that when applying &#x00A7; 7116(d), the Authority looks at the individual issues raised by a grievance, not the grievance as a whole. For example, if a ULP charge alleges a statutory violation, <span class="Italic">and</span> a later-filed grievance alleges the same statutory violation and a separate contractual violation, then &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars only the portion of the grievance alleging the statutory violation.[38] In other words, &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not bar the portion of the grievance alleging a purely contractual violation.[39] In fact, this approach is so longstanding that it predates the Statute. Specifically, in interpreting Section 19(d) of Executive Order 11,491--on which Congress modeled &#x00A7; 7116(d)[40]--the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations applied a similar approach.[41] Therefore, under well-settled law, even if the Arbitrator had resolved both the ULP allegation and the contractual allegations initially set forth in the grievance, &#x00A7; 7116(d) would warrant setting aside only the Arbitrator's resolution of the ULP--not her resolution of the contractual allegations.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the Arbitrator properly applied &#x00A7; 7116(d), we reject the dissent's suggestion that we should treat the terms "matters" and "issues" as meaning the same thing. In keeping with the U.S. Supreme Court's guidance, we "refrain from concluding" that Congress intended different terms in &#x00A7; 7116(d) to have the "same meaning."[44] Like the Court, we recognize the "well-established canon of statutory interpretation"[45] that "every word of a statute must be presumed to have been used for a purpose,"[46] so as not to "construe different terms within a statute to embody the same meaning."[47] Such a presumption has even greater <span id="page_1713"></span>force where, as here, distinct terms are used within the very same sentence.[48] The dissent provides no basis for abandoning these well-established legal principles and finding that two different terms in &#x00A7; 7116(d)--"issues" and "matters"--have precisely the same meaning.</p>

We note that both the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have issued regulations implementing &#x00A7; 7121(d) in a manner that preserves the Statute's distinction between a "matter" (i.e., an underlying agency action)[49] and an "issue" (i.e., a particular legal allegation).[50] For example, the EEOC's regulations prohibit an employee who has grieved a &#x00A7; 7121(d) "matter" from filing a "complaint on the same matter...irrespective...of whether the [earlier-filed] grievance...raised an <span class="Italic">issue</span> of discrimination."[51] Applying that provision, federal district courts have dismissed federal employees' civil complaints alleging equal-employment-opportunity violations after finding that the complaints involved the same agency actions ("matter[s]") as earlier-filed grievances, even though the earlier-filed grievances did not include the same allegations of discrimination ("issue[s]") as the court complaints.[52] These regulations and the cases decided under them further demonstrate that, for purposes of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(d) and 7121(d) of the Statute, "matter" and "issue" mean different things.</p>

But applying that standard would deny aggrieved parties a choice of forums in certain circumstances. In that regard, it is well settled that purely contractual violations are not ULPs and, thus, may not be litigated in the statutory-ULP process.[55] Therefore, under the dissent's standard, if a party wanted to allege that the same facts established both a ULP and a contractual violation, then the party would have only one route to get both issues resolved: the negotiated-grievance procedure. And that assumes, of course, that the parties' negotiated-grievance procedure does not exclude grievances alleging ULPs[56] and that the opposing party stipulates, or the arbitrator frames, any disputes that reach arbitration to include both statutory and contractual issues.[57] That is not a meaningful choice.

<p class="noindent">Member Pizzella dissented in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3148</span>, arguing that the ULP process or the grievance process, but not both, should have been involved to address an interrelated bargaining obligation and contractual violation remedial request arising out of a single management action--a change in schedules, 67 FLRA 442, 451-54 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Over thirty years ago, in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>,[1] then-Judge Antonin Scalia, writing for a unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, commented on the "confusing duplicity"[2] of otherwise "conventional"[3] terms that are found throughout the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (our Statute).[4] The court observed in that case that the prologue of &#x00A7; 7106(b)[5] could "serve two distinct purposes, which are often difficult to distinguish."[6] Donald P. Moynihan, Professor of Public Affairs at the Robert M. LaFollette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, similarly observed that Congressional committees drafting the provisions that would become our Statute purposely used "fuzzy" and "ambivalent statutory language" in order to gain the support of competing interests with "diverg[ent] views."[7]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Since then, other similarly "fuzzy" terms contained in our Statute have continued to bedevil the Authority, and the Authority has been criticized for its "narrow" interpretations of those terms.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Fed. BOP v. FLRA</span>, 654 F.3d 91, 97 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">My colleagues conclude that the grievance, filed by the Union, advanced a different legal theory than was presented in an earlier-filed unfair labor practice (ULP) charge and that, therefore, the grievance is not barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). I disagree with the framework that the majority applies to reach that conclusion but, even if I were to apply the same framework, I would still conclude that &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars the grievance. Therefore, I dissent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case raises the question of when, and under what circumstances, a grievance will be barred by an earlier-filed ULP charge. That question, however, turns on the interpretation of a ubiquitous word--"issues"--that is used in &#x00A7; 7116(d) to preclude a party from raising the same dispute as a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure and also as a <span id="page_1714"></span>ULP charge--"<span class="Italic">issues</span> which can be raised under a grievance procedure may...be raised under the grievance procedure or as [a ULP]...<span class="Italic">but not under both procedures</span>." Section 7121(d) uses a different, but similarly common term--"matter"--to preclude an employee (or a union) from filing a grievance on the same "matter" that was previously raised under a statutory appeals process (typically as an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). Interestingly, Webster's Dictionary and other esteemed reference resources, including the Oxford Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, Webster's Thesaurus, Dictionary.com, and Vocabulary.com, as well as Black's Law Dictionary, all recognize the terms as synonyms and include "matter" in the definition of "issue."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A casual observer might then be shocked to learn that the meanings of these simple terms have been disputed more than 200 times in cases that have been brought before the Authority for resolution.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In establishing the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), Congress was well aware that it was creating new and additional review processes from which federal employees and unions could seek redress for workplace grievances and that overlap was bound to occur.[12] But in the debate that led to the passage of the CSRA, Congress made clear that it intended to prevent "<span class="Italic">duplicative proceedings by</span> requiring an aggrieved party to make <span class="Italic">an election of remedies</span>."[13] Sections 7116(d) and 7121(d) were included in our Statute to function as those checks.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is apparent, then, that by modeling &#x00A7; 7116(d) after the preclusionary language used in Section 19(d) of Executive Order 11,491,[15] Congress intended to reinforce the idea that aggrieved employees and unions should have the opportunity to air workplace disputes before a fair and impartial tribunal.

<p class="noindent-1">That is a simple and unremarkable proposition.&#x2003;But over time, the Authority has developed a complex framework that strays from this longstanding principle, and now rarely finds that an earlier-filed ULP charge and a later-filed grievance "involve the same issue," even when it is clear that the grievance and the ULP charge arise "from the same set of factual circumstances."[16] Consequently, the Authority has permitted unions and grievants, time and again, to parse into separate grievances and ULP charges disputes that involve the same parties and that arise out of the same factual circumstances.[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Over the past decade, however, several Members have questioned this approach.[18] I share their concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz</span>., 64 FLRA 355, 364 (2009) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Beck) (prior filing of MSPB appeal that challenges agency's application of CBA provisions bars employee from seeking individual relief in later-filed ULP charge); <span class="Italic">NATCA, AFL-CIO</span>, 62 FLRA 526, 528 (2008) (Concurring Opinion of Chairman Cabaniss) (Authority should reexamine how we address grievances that raise matters that have been addressed in previously filed ULP charges); <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 59 FLRA at 118 (Dissenting Opinion of Member Armendariz) (&#x00A7; 7116(d) precludes a party from getting "two bites of the apple"; a ULP charge that alleges the agency violated the Statute when it would not schedule grievances for arbitration in violation of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) does not advance a sufficiently distinct legal theory from a grievance that alleges the agency violated the same provisions of the CBA when it would not schedule the same grievances for arbitration).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As I noted in my first opinion as a Member of the Authority,[19] it is imperative that the Authority be mindful of those circumstances where workplace grievances "unwisely consume[&#8197;] federal resources...and serve[&#8197;] to undermine 'the effective conduct of [government] business'"[20] and our responsibilities to the taxpayer who foot the bill for these grievances.[21] I am not convinced that the framework applied by the majority is consistent with Congress' original intent to avoid duplicative complaints and grievances. I am even less certain that it promotes the "effective conduct of government business"[22] when a party is permitted to parse, into separate grievances and complaints, those issues or matters--that involve the same parties, the same collective-bargaining agreement (CBA), and involve issues or matters that easily could have been consolidated into a single action--simply because the party frames the underlying issue in a slightly different manner.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union argues that its ULP charge addressed only that the Agency violated our Statute when it "<span class="Italic">failed to bargain in good faith</span>" concerning the Agency's "unilateral elimination of the lunch break." But the Union also argues that the earlier-filed ULP charge does not preclude the later-filed grievance (that was filed while the ULP charge was still in process) because the grievance alleges "a violation of <span class="Italic">both</span> [our Statute] <span class="Italic">and the [m]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">aster [a]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">greement</span>." Even a cursory review of the underlying ULP demonstrates that the allegation of a statutory violation involves an application of the very same contract provisions that are alleged to constitute separate contract and statutory violations in the later-filed grievance. In this respect, the Union's argument sounds a bit like "Bluto" Blutarsky in the movie <span class="Italic">Animal House</span>: "Over? Did you say 'over'? Nothing is over until we decide it is!"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, I can only conclude that the Union's grievance is barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d). But even if I were to apply the framework that is applied by the majority, I would still conclude that the Union's grievance is barred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The clear mandate of &#x00A7; 7116(d) is to avoid "duplicative proceedings."[25] And as noted above, it states, quite simply, that "issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may...<span class="Italic">be raised</span> under the grievance procedure or as an [ULP], <span class="Italic">but not under both procedures</span>." Before the Arbitrator, the Agency argued that "the grievance in the instant case contains <span class="Italic">the same subject matter</span> as the ULP charge; the <span class="Italic">issue raised in the grievance</span> was raised under the ULP procedures...[a]ccordingly, &#x00A7; 7116(d) bars the instant grievance."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 963 F.2d 429, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">My colleagues make the incredible assertion, however, that even "if a ULP <span id="page_1715"></span>charge alleges a statutory violation, and a later-filed grievance alleges <span class="Italic">the same</span> <span class="Italic">statutory violation</span>, and <span class="Italic">a separate contractual violation</span>, then...&#x00A7; 7116(d) <span class="Italic">does not bar</span> the portion of the grievance alleging a <span class="Italic">contractual violation</span>," regardless of how intertwined, or foundationally similar, are the issues, so long as the union is clever enough to use different words to describe its grievance. That gives an entirely new meaning to &#x00A7; 7116(d). In other words, my colleagues now read &#x00A7; 7116(d) as though it states: <span class="Italic">issues (which are inseparably bound up with the express language of the CBA) and have been raised as a statutory violation in a ULP may be raised again in a later-filed grievance so long as the union frames the grievance issues separately as contractual and statutory violations</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator, and now the majority, ignore the plain fact that in addressing (and ultimately dismissing) the earlier-filed ULP charge, the Regional Director had already determined that the Agency had not violated its obligation to bargain because the "disputed matter" (eliminating the lunch schedule for certain employees) was "inseparably bound up with" "the express language of the contract." Specifically, the Regional Director found that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the CBA <span class="Italic">expressly covers</span> the subject of hours of work, and it specifically provides that some shifts may be eight consecutive hours without <span class="Italic">the paid lunch break</span>. The A[gency] followed the rules in the CBA...[t]herefore the issue was covered by the CBA and the A[gency] had <span class="Italic">no further obligation</span> to bargain on this subject matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this later-filed grievance, the Union again asserts that the Agency violated the Statute <span class="Italic">and</span> the CBA when it eliminated the lunch schedules for certain employees without bargaining first with the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite its protestations to the contrary, the Union simply reframed the same issues in its later-filed grievance. As the Authority determined in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Air Engineering Station, Lakehurst, New Jersey</span>,[32] "there can be no doubt that the same facts and the same decision are involved."[33] At the time the Union filed its grievance, it raised issues that were "substantially similar"[34] to those raised in its earlier-filed ULP charge.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It does not matter now that the Regional Director declined to issue a complaint.&#x2003;The Authority has long held that "an <span class="Italic">issue is 'raised'</span> within the meaning of [&#x00A7;] 7116(d) at the time <span class="Italic">of the filing</span> of a grievance or a ULP charge."[35] In advising teenagers about the consequence of their choices, author Sean Covey notes that while "[w]e are free to choose our paths...we can't choose the consequences that come with them."[36] And, under these circumstances, the Union should not be permitted to avoid the consequence of an earlier-filed ULP charge simply because it did not like the outcome.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">I doubt that Congress intended the application of &#x00A7; 7116(d) to depend on how a union words its complaints and grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I also question the manner in which the majority resolves the Agency's management-rights and covered-by arguments. But it is not necessary for me to address those concerns because I would conclude that the Union's grievance is barred by &#x00A7; 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent">Separate statutory and contract violations involving the extent of union involvement in procedures used to determine details, temporary assignments, and the filling of vacancies, sufficed to avoid an election between ULP and grievance procedures, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 55 FLRA 951, 953-54 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) of the Statute provides that issues that may be raised under a negotiated grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under either procedure, but not under both procedures. The determination of whether a ULP charge is barred by an earlier-filed grievance requires examining whether "the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the theory advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Army Finance and</span> <span class="Italic">Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411, </span>38 FLRA 1345, 1351 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom.

Cir. 1992) <span class="Italic">(Local 1411). </span>Only if both requirements are satisfied is a subsequent ULP charge barred by a former grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether the theory advanced in support of a ULP charge and a grievance are substantially similar, the Authority has held, in a variety of circumstances, that a ULP alleging a violation of the Statute raises a sufficiently distinct theory from a grievance alleging a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, such that section 7116(d) does not preclude the later proceeding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, North Chicago, Illinois</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2107, </span>52 FLRA 387, 392-93 (1996) <span class="Italic">(VAMC,</span> <span class="Italic">North Chicago); American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, National Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 49 FLRA 906, 914-15 (1994) <span class="Italic">(EEOC). See also Local</span> <span class="Italic">1411, </span>960 F.2d at 178. For example, in <span class="Italic">VAMC, North</span> <span class="Italic">Chicago, </span>the Authority found that a ULP charge alleging that the agency implemented a policy denying cash performance awards without providing the union with notice and an opportunity to bargain was not barred by a prior grievance alleging that the agency's denial of performance awards was not fair and equitable, as required by the parties' collective bargaining agreement. 52 FLRA at 392-93.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievance and the ULP rest on different legal theories. Specifically, the issue in the grievance is whether the Agency's unilateral decision to exclude the Union from the selection process nationwide is "contrary to well established past practice and AF Order 3330.1." In contrast, the issue in the amended ULP complaint is whether the Respondent's unilateral decision to exclude the Charging Party from interview panels at the local level is a repudiation of the parties' MOU and, for this reason, a violation of the Statute. The grievance does not assert that the Agency violated the Statute, and the charge and amended ULP complaint do not include any mention of a violation of a past practice or an Agency order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Allegations involving violations of the Statute present distinct legal theories from those alleging violations of past practice or an agency order.&#x2003;For example, in determining whether an agency has violated a past practice, it must be established, among other things, that the agency exercised a consistent policy concerning a condition of employment for an extended period of time and that the agency acted inconsistent with that policy<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation</span> <span class="Italic">Depot, Pensacola, Florida and American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 1960, Pensacola, Florida, </span>48 FLRA 731, 734 (1993). In this connection, the national grievance at issue in this case alleges that the Agency had a nationwide policy regarding Union participation in the selection process and that the Agency violated the policy. On the other hand, in establishing whether an agency has violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by repudiating a collective bargaining agreement--as alleged in this case--it must be determined whether the respondent's action was a "clear and patent breach of the terms of the agreement[,]" and whether the provision of the agreement breached goes to "the heart of the parties'...agreement[.]" <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, 375th Mission Support Squadron, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois and National Association Of Government Employees, Local R7-23, SEIU, AFL-CIO,</span> 51 FLRA 858, 862-63 (1996). In this case, the Respondent is charged with violating the Statute by repudiating the parties' MOU and as a result, it must be determined whether the Respondent breached a term of the MOU, whether the breach was clear and patent, and whether the provision breached went to the heart of the MOU. These issues are distinct from those presented by the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the record supports the Judge's conclusion that the amended complaint was not barred under section 7116(d) of the Statute.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, we note that the Judge's conclusion that section 7116(d) does not apply to the process of amending ULP complaints is incorrect.

In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command and NFFE Local 2096</span>, 45 FLRA 138, 146 (1992), a ULP protested unfavorable treatment of a union official during a RIF. The grievance alleged that the RIF violated law for several reasons including: the absence of a feasibility study; the RIF eliminating quality review functions required by procurement regulations; the competitive areas involved not being properly structured; and management inappropriately assigning managers to unit positions during the RIF. The ULP charge alleged that the employer violated the Statute by attempting to "bust the Union" by the manner that it structured the RIF. Deciding that the issues raised by the grievance were not the same as those involved in the ULP charge, FLRA discerned no bar presented by &#x00A7; 7116.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1716"></span>Should a party receive a favorable arbitration award and then be faced with a compliance problem and file a grievance to resolve it, that party cannot then file a ULP concerning compliance. Subsequent reopening by FLRA of the first grievance case through the exceptions process does not negate the election of the compliance grievance. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3320 and DHUD, Region VI</span>, 23 FLRA 20, 23 (1986).</p>
