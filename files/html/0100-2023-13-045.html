<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-46"><span class="space">l.</span> Whistleblowing Reprisal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"Just as in 'otherwise appealable actions,'...a resignation is actionable in an IRA appeal only if the appellant shows that it was involuntary." <span class="Italic">Lawley v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 84 MSPR 253, 257 &#x00B6; 8 (1999). An IRA case, <span class="Italic">Zygmunt v. DHHS</span>, 61 MSPR 379, 380, 382-84 (1994), commented on the materiality of the employer's intentions toward the appellant as well as the employee's motivation in an appeal from a forced resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an IRA appeal in which she alleged that the agency forced her to resign from her Medical Officer position because of her whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is empowered to "order such corrective action as [it] considers appropriate" in an IRA appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). As noted above, the appellant alleges that she resigned approximately four days after the agency threatened to terminate her. As corrective action, she seeks reinstatement and back pay. Such a remedy goes well beyond mere abatement of the threat; if she made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the threat to terminate her was a prohibited personnel practice, and nothing more, we could not conclude that reinstatement and back pay is appropriate corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under well-established doctrine interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other laws proscribing discrimination in employment, an individual who resigned from his or her job in the face of allegedly unlawful discrimination, and who seeks reinstatement and back pay, must show that he or she was "constructively discharged." In order to establish that he or she has suffered a constructive discharge, an employee must show that the working conditions were "so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's shoes would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig</span>, 963 F.2d 2, 6 (1st Cir. 1992).[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Accord Clowes v. Allegheny Valley Hospital,</span> 991 F.2d 1159, 1161 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 114 S. Ct. 441, 126 L. Ed.2d 374 (1993); <span class="Italic">Woodward v. City of</span> <span class="Italic">Worland</span>, 977 F.2d 1392, 1401 (10th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 113 S. Ct. 3038, 125 L. Ed.2d 724 (1993); <span class="Italic">Snider v. Consolidation Coal Co.,</span> 973 F.2d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 113 S. Ct. 981, 122 L. Ed.2d 134 (1993); <span class="Italic">Boze v. Branstetter,</span> 912 F.2d 801, 804 (5th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Steele v.</span> <span class="Italic">Offshore Shipbuilding,</span> 867 F.2d 1311, 1317 (11th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Nationwide</span> <span class="Italic">Insurance,</span> 823 F.2d 360, 361 (9th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Citibank,</span> 762 F.2d 212, 221 (2d Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Marsh,</span> 665 F.2d 1168, 1173-74 (D.C. Cir. 1981); EEOC Dec. No. 84-1, 33 F.E.P. Cases 1887, 1892 (Nov. 28, 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We adopt a similar approach here. The appellant is not entitled to reinstatement and back pay as corrective action, even if she makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the threat to terminate her was a prohibited personnel practice, unless she can also show that a reasonable person in her shoes would have resigned in the face of the threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant must show that she resigned because of the threat, and not for some other reason. Reinstatement and back pay would not be appropriate corrective action if, for example, before the agency threatened to terminate the appellant, she had made plans to submit her resignation prior to the expiration of her probationary period. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> EEOC Dec. No. 84-1, 33 F.E.P. Cases 1887, 1892 (Nov. 28, 1983) (to demonstrate that there has been a constructive discharge, the former employee must show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that his or her resignation "resulted from" the discriminatory working conditions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, the appellant's resignation will be evaluated under both an objective and a subjective standard. It must have been reasonable under the circumstances, and it must actually have been the result of the threatened termination. <span class="Italic">Cf. Harris v. Forklift</span> <span class="Italic">Systems</span>, [510 U.S. 17], 114 S. Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993) (in a hostile environment sexual harassment claim under Title VII, an employee must show that a reasonable person would find the working environment hostile or abusive, and that the employee himself or herself actually perceived the environment to be hostile).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some courts also require a former employee to show, in a constructive discharge action, that the employer intended to force the employee to quit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Clay Printing</span>, 955 F.2d 936, 944 (4th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Hervey v. City of</span> <span class="Italic">Little Rock,</span> 787 F.2d 1223, 1231 (8th Cir. 1986). Other courts expressly reject such an approach, and hold that the employer's intentions are irrelevant. <span class="Italic">Boze v. Branstetter</span>, 912 F.2d 801, 804 (5th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Nationwide Insurance</span>, 823 F.2d 360, 361 (9th Cir. 1987). We find the latter authorities more persuasive. An employer "must be held to have intended those consequences [of its actions] it could reasonably have foreseen." <span class="Italic">Clark v. Marsh,</span> 665 F.2d 1168, 1175 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (citation omitted). The appellant in the present appeal, therefore, need not show that the agency, when it threatened to terminate her, intended to exact her resignation.</p>

VA</span>, SF-1221-20-0387-W-1 (NP 7/18/2022) ("Among other things, she noted that the appellant took extensive leave for nearly 2 years before eventually resigning from the agency. She further noted that, during that time, the appellant had virtually no contact with the CBOC clinic and most of the officials he had routinely clashed with retired or otherwise left the agency. For these reasons and others, the administrative judge concluded that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would not have felt compelled to resign when the appellant did so."); <span class="Italic">Peasley v.

He also submitted a letter from his treating physician, which describes a deteriorating medical condition and suggests that it may be due to his work situation. The appellant further alleged that his supervisor, C.L., retaliated against him due to his reportedly uncovering and disclosing that C.L. had been violating agency regulations and authorizing unlawful payments to recipients of Federal funding for years."); <span class="Italic">Bravo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The voluntariness of a resignation is determined based on whether the totality of the circumstances supports the conclusion that the employee was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter. <span class="Italic">See Braun v. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs</span>, 50 F.3d 1005, 1007 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1574; <span class="Italic">Perlman,</span> 490 F.2d at 933; <span class="Italic">Heining,</span> 68 MSPR at 519-20. The application of the totality of the circumstances test must be gauged by an objective standard rather than by an employee's subjective evaluation. <span class="Italic">See Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1575. In cases where the employee has alleged that intolerable working conditions led to her resignation, the appropriate test for involuntariness is whether under all the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign<span class="Italic">. See Conover v. Department of the Army,</span> 78 MSPR 605, 612 (1998). In this case, the appellant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his resignation was involuntary in order to establish that the Board has IRA jurisdiction over the resignation as a "personnel action" as that term is defined at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] (the appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, with respect to issues of jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Shelly v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 75 MSPR 411, 413-14 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the petition for review, counsel for the appellant argue that he had been subjected to an ongoing pattern of reprisal and harassment that eventually resulted in the appellant's resignation when he was unable to return to work due to anxiety. Specifically, the appellant alleges that the agency's acts of reprisal and harassment included a detail to another position, a letter of warning threatening disciplinary action up to and including termination, a reassignment to a position for which the appellant was not qualified, and the denial of the appellant's requests to be reassigned to one of several open quality assurance positions for which the appellant was fully qualified. The appellant also alleges that the agency placed him on administrative leave and abolished his position while he was detailed elsewhere to prevent the appellant from investigating DAWIA funding discrepancies and to punish him for "blowing the whistle" on these activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Essentially, the appellant alleged that several agency actions that occurred shortly after he made his disclosures, and shortly before he resigned, resulted in the appellant's inability to work due to work-related anxiety. He alleged that he suffered loss of appetite and had trouble sleeping, and that he experienced extreme chest pains and dizziness while at the office. The appellant also alleged that a physician told him that he was suffering from acute anxiety and referred the appellant to <span id="Page_1971"></span>a work stress program. Finally, the appellant alleged that when he discussed the possibility of resigning and seeking other employment with his doctor, his doctor concurred and congratulated the appellant on his "clarity of thought." In support of these claims, the appellant submitted copies of several medical certificates documenting the appellant's inability to return to work during the period from March 9, 1998 through April 5, 1998. Several of the certificates indicated that the appellant was suffering from anxiety. We find that these allegations are sufficient to entitle the appellant to a jurisdictional hearing on the issue of whether his resignation amounted to a "personnel action" for the purposes of the Board's IRA jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 MSPR 421, 424 (1995) (the appellant raised a nonfrivolous claim that his resignation was involuntary where he alleged that he resigned due to health concerns caused by agency harassment); <span class="Italic">Swift v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 29, 32-33 (1994) (appellant was entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue where he alleged that he suffered from depression with anxiety as a result of specified particular acts of harassment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an appellant could attempt to show that a resignation was forced by intolerable working conditions, a claim of whistleblowing reprisal without the showing of intolerable working conditions cannot be independently adjudicated by the Board unless the appellant has followed IRA procedures described in <a href="0100-2023-20-109.html#sec13-105">Chapter 13</a>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walsh v. EPA</span>, DA-0752-13-0171-I-1 n.4 (NP 7/31/2014) ("The appellant also asserts that the source of his ill treatment by the agency was 'whistle blowing.' Absent jurisdiction over the appellant's termination as an adverse action, the Board cannot adjudicate a claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) as an affirmative defense, and it cannot adjudicate such a claim as an individual right of action appeal because the appellant did not seek corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although whistleblowing reprisal may be found, a resignation may be determined to be voluntary if the appellant was challenging the reprisal and resigned before adjudication of the reprisal claims, <span class="italic">Ingram-Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-1221-14-0633-W-2 (NP 2/23/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have found that the appellant suffered a significant change in her duties, responsibilities, and working conditions, the Board has held that the fact that an employee is faced with an inherently unpleasant situation or that her choices are limited to unpleasant alternatives does not make her decision to resign involuntary. <span class="italic">Lawson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 345, 350 (1995). Here, the appellant already had begun seeking redress on her retaliation claims and could have waited for the outcome of her IRA appeals to determine if resignation was necessary. <span class="italic">See Axsom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 17 (2009). Instead, the appellant opted to resign prior to adjudicating her retaliation claims. Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant has failed to prove by preponderant evidence that her resignation was involuntary.</p>
