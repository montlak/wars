<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Norton v. VA,</span> PH-0752-08-0442-C-2 (NP 7/13/2011), generally noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority to ensure make-whole relief may also extend to areas over which it would not otherwise have jurisdiction, in order to remedy any retaliation to which an appellant may have been subjected. <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 319, &#x00B6; 12 (2011); <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 13 (2009). The agency has the burden of proving that it has fully complied with a Board final decision. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the</span> Navy, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 498, 501 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Back Pay Act or another statute does not provide specific authorization for the equivalent of a monetary remedy, the Board is disinclined to create a remedy in the form of equitable relief because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 105 MSPR 634, 638-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-19, 2007 MSPB 133 (2007), involving an appeal from a constructive suspension based upon enforced leave status, the Board concluded that the limitations of the FAA personnel management system (the Ford Act) precluded an award of back pay, despite the Board's authority to entertain the constructive suspension appeal. That appeal was sustained, but an award of back pay was denied. The Board declined to fashion an equivalent remedy of restoration of the leave the employee was required to use:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties to this appeal stipulated that the agency did not provide the appellant with advance notice of its plan to place him on enforced leave, that it did not provide him with an opportunity to respond to a proposal to take that action, and that it did not give him "a decision letter prior to the October 7, 2005 verbal notification" that he would be placed in a leave status. Relying on these stipulations, the administrative judge found that the agency's action violated the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process and could not be sustained. The agency has identified no error in this finding (aside from the jurisdictional claim that we have found to be without merit), and we see none.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4965"></span>We have indicated above that the administrative judge ordered the agency to cancel the appellant's suspension and to provide the appellant with the appropriate amount of back pay. After the administrative judge issued his initial decision, the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Ivery v. Department of Transportation</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 356 (2006), a case in which the employee had filed a petition for enforcement of a Board order. In its earlier decision on that appeal, the Board had overturned the employee's removal and had ordered the agency to pay the employee back pay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 2. In the more recent decision cited above, however, the Board noted that payment of funds from the public fisc could not be ordered without an express waiver of sovereign immunity, and that, although the Back Pay Act provided such a waiver, the 1995 legislation cited above, in which the FAA was required to develop its own personnel system, had the effect of making certain provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code--including the provisions of the Back Pay Act--inapplicable to FAA employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14. It noted further that, although the Administrator of the FAA had the authority to adopt the substance of any portion of title 5, and although this authority had been exercised as to some portions of that title, the provisions of the Back Pay Act had not been made applicable to FAA employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 12. Finally, the Board held that the back pay provision of the personnel system adopted under that legislation did not apply to Board appeals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16. In the absence of any authority to award back pay to the employee, the Board vacated the portion of its previous decision in which it had ordered restoration of pay and benefits the employee had lost as a result of the improper personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in the present appeal has stated without contradiction that he was placed on sick leave during his constructive suspension, and that, when his sick leave was exhausted, he was placed on leave without pay. His placement on leave without pay caused him, like the employee in <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>, to lose an opportunity to earn pay and benefits. In a case covered by the Back Pay Act, the Board would order the agency whose improper personnel action caused the loss of such an opportunity to compensate the employee by providing him with back pay, i.e., to pay him damages in an amount equal to the amount he would have earned in the absence of the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). For the reasons stated in <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>, however, we have no authority to issue such an order in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's order also would, in effect, require the agency to restore the sick leave the appellant took during the period of his constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Teel v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2006) (the appropriate remedy for improperly charging an employee annual leave for his military absence was to order the agency to restore the improperly charged leave), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 201 Fed. Appx. 770 (Fed. Cir. 2006). This remedy differs from the remedy initially ordered in <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>. That is, while an order to pay an employee back pay for a period when he did not work constitutes an award of monetary damages as a substitute for the pay he would have earned if he had been permitted to do so, restoration of leave improperly charged to an employee constitutes "specific relief," i.e., an equitable remedy that returns to the employee "the very thing that was taken from him." <span class="Italic">See Hubbard v. Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 982 F.2d 531, 533 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Ivery</span> holding described above was based in part on <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 205 F.3d 1315, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2000). <span class="Italic">See Ivery</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 14. In <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span>, the court addressed the Board's authority to award monetary damages, i.e., back pay for a period when the plaintiff, as a result of the agency's improper failure to employ him, had not been permitted to work. <span class="Italic">See Hubbard</span>, 205 F.3d at 1316. In holding that the Board lacked this authority, it stated that, "[t]o sustain a claim that the Government is liable for awards of <span class="Italic">monetary damages</span>, [a] waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1318 (emphasis added). Neither the court in <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span> nor the Board in <span class="Italic">Ivery</span> addressed the effect of the absence of a waiver of sovereign immunity on the Board's authority to award specific or equitable relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the enactment of legislation in 1976, there appeared to be some disagreement or uncertainty about whether, absent a waiver, sovereign immunity barred not only monetary damage awards, but the granting of equitable relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> H. Rep. No. 94-1656, at 7 (1976), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6121, 6127-28. Decisions of the U.S. courts of appeals seemed to indicate that it did bar such relief. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Penn v. Schlesinger</span>, 490 F.2d 700, 704 (5th Cir. 1973) (sovereign immunity bars a "declaratory judgment, if equivalent to a claim for injunctive relief"), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 497 F.2d 970 (5th Cir. 1974); <span class="Italic">Littell v. Morton</span>, 445 F.2d 1207, 1213 (4th Cir. 1971) (sovereign immunity applied to request that government be required to compensate attorney for services he rendered)[4]. The U.S. Supreme Court also seemed to have indicated or suggested that specific relief, if not permitted by a waiver, would be barred by sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See Dugan v. Rank</span>, 372 U.S. 609, 620 (1963) ("The general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign...if the effect of the judgment would be 'to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.'"). In light of these decisions, we find that the Board is barred from ordering the agency in the present case to restore the appellant's sick leave unless there has been an express waiver of sovereign immunity covering the awarding of such specific relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Littell</span> sought monetary payment, this remedy may have constituted specific relief, rather than damages. <span class="Italic">See Hubbard</span>, 982 F.2d at 534 n.4 (a backpay award may constitute specific relief, rather than money damages, if the pay is owed to the employee for work he performed, and for which he was not paid).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Decisions such as <span class="Italic">Penn</span> and <span class="Italic">Littell</span>, the uncertainty noted above, and a belief that the doctrine of sovereign immunity had led to injustice prompted Congress to enact legislation in 1976 "remov[ing]...[this] defense as a bar to judicial review of Federal administrative action otherwise subject to judicial review." H. Rep. No. 94-1656, at 1; <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 5-10, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6121, 6125-30; Act of Oct. 21, 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-574, 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. (90 Stat.) 2721 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 702, 703). Specifically, Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 702 to provide that an "action in a court of the United States seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity...shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States...." 90 Stat. 2721.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It could be argued that this waiver of sovereign immunity extends to administrative proceedings such as those before the Board. In <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212 (1999), the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted somewhat similar statutory language, containing no specific reference to administrative proceedings, as waiving sovereign immunity against compensatory damages in proceedings before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In doing so, it noted that a contrary decision "would undermine [the] remedial scheme" under which a complainant was to pursue administrative relief prior to court action, that it "would force into court matters that the EEOC might otherwise have resolved," and that, "by preventing earlier resolution of a dispute, it would increase the burdens of both time and expense" related to the resolution of discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 218-19. The same considerations appear applicable here. That is, construing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 702 as authorizing a court to award relief that the Board cannot award would appear illogical and inconsistent with the employee appeals system, under which an employee must exhaust his administrative remedy with the Board before proceeding to court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the Court in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> did not rely solely or even primarily on the considerations described above. Instead, it relied primarily on the statutory language, the purpose of the statute, and legislative history, and only secondarily on considerations such as those described above--considerations it described as showing "the absence of any convincing reason for denying the EEOC the relevant power...." <span class="Italic">See Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. at 217-222. We note further that the statutory language at issue in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> is materially different from that at issue here. The provision in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by providing that a "complaining party may recover compensatory...damages" in "an action brought" under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act, pertaining to federal employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 215. Although section 717 included a paragraph related to civil actions, it also included a paragraph providing the EEOC with the authority to enforce, "through appropriate remedies," the federal government's employment antidiscrimination standard. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 214-15, 217. The Court found that, by adding compensatory damages to the remedies available under section 717, and by failing to limit the applicability of the amendment to civil actions, Congress had intended to authorize the EEOC, and not just federal courts, to award compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 217-21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 702 refers specifically, as noted above, to "[a]n action in a court of the United States...." It also is included in a chapter of title 5, U.S. Code, that is entitled "Judicial Review." The plain language of this section and of the chapter in which it is included therefore does not support a finding that the Board is authorized to award equitable relief in cases such as this. Moreover, the House report cited above indicates that the purpose of the amendment at issue here was to close a gap in the judicial review that was available under statutes such as the Tucker Act of 1875, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1346, 1491, and the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(b). H. Rep. No. 94-1656, at 4-5, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6124-25. Nothing in the report indicates that Congress intended to modify remedies available in administrative proceedings such as this. Under these circumstances, we cannot find that Congress intended, by amending 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 702, to broaden the remedies available in administrative proceedings before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency acknowledges, the Ford Act had the effect of restoring the applicability of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204, 1221, and 7701 to FAA employees. Section 7701 authorizes the Board to adjudicate appeals; section 1204 authorizes it to enforce compliance with its orders; and section 1221 <span id="Page_4966"></span>authorizes it to order appropriate corrective action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), 1221(e)(1), (g)(1). Section 1221 applies only to cases in which the employee or applicant for employment has raised a claim of reprisal for making a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), however, and no such claim has been raised here. Moreover, neither section 7701 nor section 1204 addresses the relief the Board may direct agencies to take in compliance with its final decisions and orders.[5] In addition, we see no other provision authorizing the Board to order either damages or equitable relief in a case such as this.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Section 7701 authorizes the Board's judges to grant, on an interim basis, "the relief provided in the [initial] decision[s]," but it does not otherwise address the nature of the relief that may be granted. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not often considered remedies aside from back pay and counsel fees.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, a financial loss arising from the sale of a home or otherwise would not constitute irreparable harm on which to base a stay. Clearly, the Board ultimately has the power under its broad corrective action authority to order a Federal employee made whole if it is found on appeal that the employee has been subject to a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1206(c)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit has not offered much by way of substantive guidance involving remedies for prohibited personnel practices. It has implied, however, that the Board should consider a little creativity in its orders. <span class="Italic">Kagel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 126 F.3d 1455, 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1997), offered commentary in an appeal involving an employee threatened with discipline unless his spouse divested a business activity that allegedly placed the employee in an apparent conflict of interest:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing Kagel's appeal, the administrative judge also concluded that even if Kagel's appeal was properly before the Board and even if Kagel prevailed on the merits of his claim of a whistleblowing violation, the Board could not fashion an effective remedy. We disagree. In disposing of an IRA appeal, the Board may order corrective action that may include an order "that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred." 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(i). If Kagel is able to prove that the threat to remove him violates the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Board could fashion a remedy consistent with that statutory authority by, for example, directing that the agency not remove him or threaten to remove him for the reasons given in the August 10 directive, even if Ms. Kagel resumes her activities within the Walla Walla district.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For victims of whistleblowing reprisal, 5 USC 3352 creates a right to preferential treatment of a transfer request if the employee is qualified for the job, eligible for appointment, and MSPB determined that the employee was the victim of whistleblowing reprisal.
