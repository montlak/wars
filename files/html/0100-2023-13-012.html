<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-13"><span class="space">C.</span> CONSTRUCTIVE ADVERSE ACTION</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Adverse actions are involuntary, yet some actions that appear voluntary are not. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-15-0097-I-1 (NP 6/30/2015) ("However, the Board has always recognized that employee-initiated actions that appear voluntary on their face are not always so. <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 140, 141 (1980)."). A resignation, a retirement, and a downgrading initiated by the employee are examples of actions that, if produced by managerial coercion or deceit, or if resulting from the employee's inability to comprehend the nature of his actions, are adverse under the law and subject to MSPB appellate jurisdiction. Voluntary actions that are legally adverse are called constructive adverse actions. Included in this category of cases, and discussed under the category of involuntary downgradings, is a peculiar type of case involving the employee reassigned from position A to B at the same grade. Position A is then reclassified to or reestablished at a higher grade, and the employee feels that he has been the victim of a downgrading: he lost out on an upgrade that would have been his but for the reassignment. This species of appeal is more akin to a classification appeal than to an adverse action appeal. The Board takes jurisdiction and adjudicates the appeal as though it were a constructive adverse action, yet the Board considers classification principles. [For decisions involving constructive adverse actions involving administrative law judges, refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-179.html#sec6-175">Constructive Action Against Judge: <span class="Italic">Tunik</span></a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-13-180.html#sec6-176">Forced Retirement"</a>; refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-228.html#sec1-225">Abandonment of Position.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A suspension is initiated by the agency. It is not the same as a constructive suspension, <span class="italic">Maibie v. USPS</span>, DE-0752-17-0030-I-1 (12/21/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant's placement on leave was involuntary and we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant established jurisdiction over an actual suspension of longer than 14 days. The agency took affirmative steps to instruct the appellant not to report to work. A constructive suspension, by contrast, arises when an absence that appears voluntary actually is not. Abbott, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee does not initiate the action, it is not presumed to be voluntary. For an action to be "initiated by" the employee, it is not required that the employee first suggest the change. The employee may initiate an action by voluntarily accepting the agency's proposal. The employee's decision to accept the agency proposal is not involuntary just because the employee must choose between two unpleasant options. An employee cannot establish that acceptance is involuntary merely by making a written notation that the action was accepted "under duress" or "signed under protest." <span class="Italic">Loggins v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 471, 476 &#x00B6; 12, 2009 MSPB 202 (2009) (relying on <span class="Italic">Reed v. USPS,</span> 99 MSPR 453, 460 &#x00B6; 12 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 198 Fed. Appx. 966 (Fed. Cir. 2006)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Weng v. Dept. of Labor,</span> CB-7121-13-0180-V-1 (NP 3/12/2015) ("written statement, <span id="Page_1894"></span>made in connection with her resignation, 'I do not waive my appeal rights'.... The Board has found that an employee cannot make an accepted agency action involuntary solely by writing the words 'under duress' or 'signed under protest.' <span class="Italic">Reed v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 15 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 198 F. App'x 966 (Fed. Cir. 2006).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bean v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BEAN_KEVIN_CORTEZ_AT_3443_12_0159_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_942807.pdf">120 MSPR 397</a>, 401-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, 2013 MSPB 96 (2013), attempted to establish a grand unifying theory of constructive adverse action law--developed over decades on a case-by-case basis in decisions of the Board and the Federal Circuit. Under <span class="Italic">Bean</span> the lowest common denominators in constructive adverse action appeals are that employees lack meaningful choices because of agencies' improper actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the appellant's retirement was a constructive removal within the Board's jurisdiction because he reasonably based his decision on the agency's incorrect advice. The choice to retire in that case was not meaningful because it was based on misinformation. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 943 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (a decision made "with blinders on," based on misinformation or a lack of information, cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process). In addition, it was the agency's improper action, i.e., the supplying of misinformation, that deprived the appellant of his choice. In contrast, a retirement decision based on misinformation that was not the agency's fault is not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Holser v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 92, 95 (1997). <span class="Italic">But see Bannister v. General Services Administration</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 362, 366-67 (1989) (a retirement may be appealable as a constructive removal even if the Office of Personnel Management, rather than the employing agency, supplied the misinformation). Although the appellant's choice to retire in <span class="Italic">Holser</span> was no more meaningful than the appellant's choice in <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, the difference between the two cases is that, in <span class="Italic">Sharf</span>, the misapprehension was due to the agency's improper act, while in <span class="Italic">Holser</span> it was not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, in <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the appellant's resignation was a constructive removal within the Board's jurisdiction because she resigned to avoid a threatened adverse action that the agency knew or should have known could not be substantiated. The appellant's choice between resigning and contesting the unfounded adverse action was not a meaningful one because it was a choice between false alternatives. <span class="Italic">See Murray v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 177, 181-82 (1995). In addition, it was improper for the agency to threaten a baseless adverse action. In <span class="Italic">Garland v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 537 (1990), the appellant likewise resigned because of a threatened adverse action. His resignation, however, was not a constructive removal because the agency had reasonable grounds for proposing the action. <span class="Italic">Garland</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 540. Thus, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Garland</span> had a meaningful choice (not one between false alternatives), and the agency action precipitating his retirement was not improper. He therefore failed to establish either of the jurisdictional conditions of a constructive adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The two types of constructive adverse action appeals discussed in &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9 and 10 above illustrate the principle that jurisdiction is established by showing: (1) the appellant lacked a meaningful choice, and (2) this was because of the agency's improper actions. Although we cannot fully discuss every fact pattern of constructive adverse action that the Board and the Federal Circuit have recognized, we believe that they are all consistent in this regard, and that this two-part jurisdictional standard is a unifying principle for all of them. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vaughan v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2011) (the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his disability retirement was a constructive removal because his disability forced him to retire and the disability was caused by the agency's improper acts); <span class="Italic">Levy v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 444, &#x00B6; 18 (2008) (a resignation or retirement is a constructive removal if the appellant tried to withdraw her application before its effective date and the agency unjustifiably refused to honor the withdrawal, thus taking the choice away from the appellant and doing so improperly); <span class="Italic">Peoples v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (1999) (to establish jurisdiction over a constructive suspension on the basis of intolerable working conditions, the appellant must show both that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to absent himself under the conditions and that the agency was culpable for those conditions); <span class="Italic">see also Brown U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 17, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F. App'x 852 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (even if the appellant's medical condition left her no alternative but to retire, she failed to tie her circumstances to an improper agency act); <span class="Italic">Searcy v. Department of Commerce</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 15 (2010) (even if the appellant's resignation was occasioned by improper agency actions, he failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that those improper actions deprived him of meaningful choice).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bean</span> noted past weaknesses in development of the common law of constructive adverse actions, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board and the Federal Circuit often emphasize the involuntariness aspect of constructive adverse action claims to the detriment of the improper agency action aspect.[6] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holloway v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 993 F.2d 219, 221 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("[T]he dispositive inquiry in determining whether there has been [an appealable constructive suspension] is whether the employee's absence from the agency was voluntary or involuntary."); <span class="Italic">Aldridge v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 670, &#x00B6; 7 (2009) (when the Board concludes that an appellant's action was involuntary, the Board not only has jurisdiction but the appellant also wins on the merits and is entitled to reinstatement). Because the focus is usually on the issue of voluntariness, it is easy to make the mistake of treating that as the only issue in the appeal and of examining all of facets of a case under that lens--even the ones that relate only to agency culpability. This is just what happened in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Notwithstanding, the Federal Circuit has explicitly recognized, at least in some contexts, that there must be an improper agency action involved as well. <span class="Italic">E.g., Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> took leave from work for medical reasons and subsequently requested to return in light duty status.[7] 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 2. The agency denied this request on the basis that there was no work available within the appellant's medical restrictions. The appellant therefore continued his absence and filed a Board appeal alleging constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4. The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant's "unpleasant" choice between taking leave and returning to work outside of his medical restrictions was voluntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. We disagree with the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, and we find that the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> led her to an incorrect result. First, we note that the basic premise of <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> is that working outside of medical restrictions is somehow a viable option for federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 15. It is difficult to imagine circumstances in which this premise would be acceptable. Second, it appears that, in <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> the real reason for the dismissal was not that the absence was voluntary (it was not) but that it was not precipitated by an improper agency action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 10 (the administrative judge found that the agency was under no obligation to provide the requested light duty work). The appellant in <span class="Italic">Crutch v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 11 (2013), was likewise faced with the choice between taking leave and working outside his medical restrictions, yet the Board found in his favor. Mr. Crutch's absence was no more or less voluntary than Mr. Johnson's. The difference between the two cases has nothing to do with voluntariness. It has everything to do with the impropriety of the agency actions that forced the choice--the failure to accommodate in <span class="Italic">Crutch</span> was improper whereas the failure to accommodate in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was not. In fact, the Board in <span class="Italic">Crutch</span> overruled <span class="Italic">Moon v. Department of the Army,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 419-20 (1994), the case upon which <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> relied in finding that the "unpleasant choice" was voluntary.[8] <span class="Italic">Crutch</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6; 11 n.2. We likewise overrule <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;As in the instant appeal, the appellant's medical condition in Johnson had not been ruled compensable. 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 2 n.1. If it had, the appeal would have been analyzed as a restoration appeal, rather than as a constructive suspension appeal. <span class="Italic">See Kinglee v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-22 (2010) (a restoration appeal subsumes a related constructive suspension claim).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The administrative judge in this case issued her initial decision before the Board issued <span class="Italic">Crutch</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, had not been overruled implicitly or explicitly at the time the administrative judge relied on it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Bean was summarized by <span class="italic">Lewis v. USPS</span>, DA-0752-16-0347-I-1 (NP 6/28/2022):</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prior to the issuance of the initial decision, the Board clarified its jurisprudence regarding constructive suspension claims, such as alleged here, in <span class="italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397 (2013). In particular, the Board noted that it has recognized several fact patterns that may give rise to an involuntary constructive suspension and it therefore rejected as misleading the statement in a line of Board cases (including Hahn on which the administrative judge relied) that constructive suspensions arise in only two situations. <span class="italic">Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8 n.4. Instead, the Board held that, assuming the jurisdictional requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 are otherwise met, proof of the following by preponderant evidence is sufficient to establish jurisdiction over a constructive suspension claim: (1) the employee lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived the employee of that choice. <span class="italic">Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="italic">see Romero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8 (2014) (applying the jurisdictional standard set forth in Bean); <span class="italic">see also Rosario-Fabregas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 833 F.3d 1342, 1345-46 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (finding that the Board's standard for establishing jurisdiction in constructive suspension cases, as set forth in Romero, is appropriate). If the appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, then he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="italic">Barrand v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 210, &#x00B6; 8 (2009). A nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is an allegation of fact that, if proven, <span id="Page_1895"></span>could establish that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">See Khenaisser v. Dept. of Interior, SF-0752-16-0665-I-1 (NP 1/23/2023) ("The touchstone of the 'voluntariness' analysis is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, factors operated on the employee's decision-making process that deprived him of freedom of choice. Vitale, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 19."); <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Freeman v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-15-0920-I-1 (NP 3/10/2016) ("The doctrine of coerced involuntariness is a narrow one and does not apply if the employee retires because he does not like agency decisions such as 'a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant...that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave.' <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The coercion must be 'the result of improper acts by the agency.' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant has alleged that he disagrees with the agency's actions but has not made specific allegations regarding how the actions were improper. Additionally, we find that the appellant's allegations concerning the more favorable treatment of other employees does not support a finding that his retirement was coerced. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 15 (2011) (finding that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her retirement was coerced where she claimed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that she was treated less favorably than other employees because of her status as an older woman)."); <span class="Italic">Savage v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bean</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Ramsay v. DOD</span>, PH-0752-14-0013-I-1 (NP 3/26/2014), concluding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over a constructive suspension appeal when the agency terminated a light duty assignment and the employee could not continue with a full workload because of medical restrictions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with Bean, we find that the appellant lacked a meaningful choice when the agency terminated her light duty assignment, but that she failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency acted improperly in terminating the assignment. The agency provided the appellant with light duty work on her request, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, which called for reassignments that were "temporary, generally not exceeding 90 days." The appellant's light duty assignment lasted from late April 2013 until August 29, 2013, a period of more than 120 days. Accordingly, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's constructive suspension appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bean</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0343-I-2 (NP 12/5/2014), determining that an employee was not constructively suspended when he did not inform the agency that he sought return to work following a medical condition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish jurisdiction over a constructive adverse action, including a constructive suspension such as is alleged here, the appellant must show that: (1) he lacked a meaningful choice in his facially voluntary decision; and (2) this was because of the agency's improper actions. <span class="Italic">See Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 11. A decision based on misinformation may satisfy this standard. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 943 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has not shown that he lacked a meaningful choice. Instead of remaining in a leave status indefinitely, he could have exercised his restoration rights if he were able to return to work with restrictions, or he could have returned to full duty if he were able to obtain a medical clearance from the agency's medical unit. He could have requested reasonable accommodation. He could have bid for a job with less strenuous duties. Rather than exercising any of these options, the appellant submitted cursory medical documentation on a monthly basis stating that he was unable to work, as well as (as relevant here) additional documentation, dated May 28, 2010, stating that he was able to work with restrictions, that was in direct conflict with other documentation from the same doctor dated the same day indicating he was unable to work at all. This conflicting medical documentation created an ambiguity in his medical status that he failed to clarify, and he never requested to return to work,[4] submitting instead a retirement application in September 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's submissions of medical documentation finding him unable to work were not requests to return to work because they did not inform the agency that he was able to work and they did not inform the agency that he wished to return to work. <span class="Italic">Cf. Bynum v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 14 (2009) (submission of medical restrictions did not constitute requests for restoration because they did not indicate a desire to return to duty), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 382 F. App'x 934 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the appellant has not shown that his continued absence from work was caused by the agency's bad actions. As noted above, the appellant created an ambiguous situation. The agency could not simply return him to work because he never requested to return to work, the vast majority of his medical documentation indicated that he was unable to work, and he indicated that he did not want to return to work when he filed his retirement application in September 2010. Therefore, even under the new jurisdictional standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, the appellant has not shown that the Board has jurisdiction over his constructive suspension claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the agency does not dispute that it placed him on enforced leave in June 2010. Because the question of jurisdiction is a legal conclusion to which the parties cannot stipulate, a statement of the agency's general position on the matter, without any facts on which a finding of jurisdiction could be based, is not relevant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McCarty v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6; 10 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Romero v. USPS</span>, 121 MSPR 606, 611 &#x00B6; 11, 2014 MSPB 76 (2014) (analyzing <span class="Italic">Bean</span> factor 2--improper agency action, and finding none when the agency did not immediately return the employee to work because of his medical restrictions: "Given the significant restrictions of less stress, less noise, and less hours, we find that there was not any improper or wrongful agency action. To the contrary, the record reflects that the agency worked diligently to find the appellant a position that met these restrictions, it held two DRAC meetings, it reasonably determined that a supervisory position did not meet these restrictions, and it offered the appellant three nonsupervisory positions. Moreover, when the agency finally learned at the end of March 2013, that the appellant could return to work with only hearing protection and hours not to exceed 12 hours a day, the agency promptly returned him to work in his Supervisor position on April 1, 2013.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trinkl v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-2356.Opinion.4-16-2020_1571150.pdf">809 Fed. Appx. 947</a>, 950-51 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), summarized decisions considering retirements or resignations challenged as involuntary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee retires from government employment, the Board has jurisdiction to review the circumstances of the employee's departure only if the employee proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the retirement was involuntary, and thus "tantamount to forced removal." <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric</span>., 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). While a decision to retire is presumed voluntary, <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 941, the presumption can be overcome by establishing that the decision was the result of coercion or deception, among other circumstances that undermine the employee's ability to exercise free choice. <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that a retirement was involuntary due to coercion, the employee must generally prove that (1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation, (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and (3) the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341. Alternatively, to establish that a retirement was involuntary based on deception or misrepresentation, the employee must establish that the agency provided misleading information on which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment in deciding to retire. <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 942; <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1575. Under both theories, the voluntariness inquiry is objective, and the Board must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or would have been materially misled to his detriment. <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1575.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Trinkl</span>, the AJ properly considers the evidence from the perspective of a reasonable person, unless there is evidence of diminished mental capacity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in this analysis by the AJ under the totality of the circumstances standard. Contrary to Mr. Trinkl's argument, the mere fact that the AJ preceded this discussion with a detailed assessment of the evidence regarding each incident does not render the ALJ's reasoning "piecemeal." Rather, a thorough and impartial evaluation of the totality of the circumstances must often begin with a detailed and methodical assessment of the evidence concerning each contested fact at issue. In order to fully evaluate whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or would have been materially misled to his detriment, <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1575, the AJ must first engage in fact finding to determine what the relevant circumstances are.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Trinkl also contends that the AJ should have considered the alleged incidents in light of his symptoms of PTSD, which he traces to stressful circumstances he encountered while traveling abroad on and immediately after September 11, 2001. The AJ's decision, however, expressly addressed Mr. Trinkl's allegations of PTSD and concluded that regardless of any effect the condition might have had on Mr. Trinkl's perception of the alleged events leading to his retirement, the totality of the circumstances did not render his departure involuntary under an objective standard. This is consistent with our precedent, which generally evaluates voluntariness from the perspective of a reasonable person. <span class="Italic">See Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1575. Here, Mr. Trinkl did not allege or present any evidence that his PTSD symptoms rendered him mentally incapable of exercising free choice or constituted a disability under the <span id="Page_1896"></span>Americans with Disabilities Act for which he had requested reasonable accommodations. <span class="Italic">Cf. Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1574 (citing <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489, 492 (1972) (recognizing that a retirement is involuntary where an employee fails to understand the situation due to mental incompetence)); <span class="Italic">Benavidez v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 241 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (noting that a claim of involuntary disability retirement requires a showing that there was an accommodation available on the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his employment, and that the agency did not provide him that accommodation). Thus, the AJ did not err in declining to consider how Mr. Trinkl's alleged PTSD may have affected his subjective perception of events.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the most common type of constructive adverse action claim--involving the assertion that a resignation, retirement, or downgrading was coerced--the structure of the appeal was outlined in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a>, 1328-30 (Fed. Cir. 2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, which enumerates specific adverse actions over which the Board has jurisdiction, extends the Board's jurisdiction to facially voluntary acts. A long line of cases, however, starting with the Board's predecessor, the Civil Service Commission (the "CSC"), dealt with this question, and generally held that seemingly voluntary actions in some circumstances may be considered adverse actions. As this court recently stated, although an "employee who voluntarily resigns or retires has no right to appeal to the MSPB[,]...the MSPB possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee who has resigned or retired if...his or her resignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal." <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citations omitted). In other words, "it is hornbook law...that an involuntary resignation constitutes an adverse action by the agency." <span class="Italic">Gratehouse v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1104, 1108 (Ct. Cl. 1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Claimants have alleged involuntariness in a number of different ways. <span class="Italic">See Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341. In <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, the allegation of involuntariness with regard to a resignation was based on the agency's threats of an adverse action against the employee. 934 F.2d 1240, 1251-53 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). In <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, involuntariness was based on the agency's alleged misinformation or deception. 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Also, claimants have alleged that the agency coerced them "by creating working conditions so intolerable for the employee that he or she is driven to involuntarily resign or retire." <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 587 (Ct. Cl. 1975)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has adopted the so-called <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> test for establishing involuntary coercion by an agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]o establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion this court requires an employee to show: (1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire; and (3) the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">see also Fruhauf Sw. Garment Co. v. United States</span>, 111 F. Supp. 945, 951 (Ct. Cl. 1953); <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124; <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587. In evaluating involuntariness, the proper test is "an objective one," <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587, and one that "consider[s] the totality of the circumstances," <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1342. The employee must "establish that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstances would feel coerced into resigning." <span class="Italic">Middleton v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">see also Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1342. In other words, when adjudicating a claim of coercive involuntariness, the three elements of the <span class="Italic">Fruhauf</span> test are evaluated from the perspective of the reasonable employee confronted with similar circumstances. <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341-42.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying this objective test, our case law has also emphasized that freedom of choice is a central issue. For example, in <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, our predecessor court held that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[w]hile it is possible plaintiff, herself, perceived no viable alternative but to tender her resignation, the record evidence supports CSC's finding that plaintiff chose to resign and accept discontinued service retirement rather than challenge the validity of her proposed discharge for cause. The fact remains, plaintiff <span class="Italic">had a choice</span>. She could stand pat and fight. She chose not to.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">518 F.2d at 587; <span class="Italic">see also Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 942. As described more recently by this court in <span class="Italic">Staats</span>,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[coercive involuntariness] does not apply to a case in which an employee decides to resign or retire because he does not want to accept a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave. As this court has explained, the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">99 F.3d at 1124.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our cases recognize that most resignations and retirements are not constructive removals, and that "the doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one" requiring that the employee "satisfy a demanding legal standard." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, it has long been held that "[e]mployee resignations are presumed voluntary [and] [t]his presumption will prevail unless plaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to establish that the resignation was involuntarily extracted." <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 587. "The MSPB possesses jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee...if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that [his or her action] was involuntary and thus tantamount to [a forced enumerated adverse action]." <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">see also Dabney v. Freeman</span>, 358 F.2d 533, 536 (D.C. Cir. 1965).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A constructive removal, as opposed to enforced leave or a constructive suspension, requires separation from a position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. DHHS</span>, CH-0752-16-0290-I-1 (NP 9/29/2016) ("An action cannot constitute a constructive removal over which the Board may exercise jurisdiction unless the employee was actually separated from her position. <span class="Italic">Donahue v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 387, &#x00B6; 21 (2005). The evidence in this appeal unequivocally shows that the appellant is an agency employee on approved leave. The fact that she has now exhausted all her paid leave and is in an unpaid leave status, as she asserts on review, does not change the fact that she remains employed by the agency.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appealable action is constructively adverse, it was imposed without constitutional due process, meaning it will be reversed. Under prevailing law, in a resignation appeal (applicable as well to retirements or involuntary downgradings), <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 107 MSPR 466, 471 n.3, 2007 MSPB 304 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board's jurisdiction and the merits of an alleged involuntary separation are inextricably intertwined. In most cases, if an appellant establishes that his resignation was involuntary, he not only establishes Board jurisdiction, but the appellant also wins on the merits. <span class="Italic">Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136; <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 789 F.2d 892, 895 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Thus, the jurisdictional question and the merits of the appeal may rise and fall together.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The converse is true, <span class="Italic">Brothers v. MSPB</span>, 502 Fed. Appx. 939, 941 (Fed. Cir. 2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Brothers contends that the Board failed to consider that he was demoted after completion of his probationary period without due process as set forth in either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303. These statutes provide procedures that an agency must follow when imposing an adverse action on an employee. The due process procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, however, do not apply to voluntary personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1328-29....</p>
