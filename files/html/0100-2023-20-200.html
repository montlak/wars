<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-194"><span class="space">c.</span> Evidence Other Than Timing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The temporal relation of a disclosure and a personnel action challenged as retaliatory may be telling, but it is not the only means of demonstrating reprisal. The AJ should take care to follow the correct analytical framework, <span class="Italic">Caddell v. DOJ</span>, 52 MSPR 529, 533-34 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who brings an IRA appeal must show by preponderant evidence that retaliation was a contributing, rather than a significant or predominant, factor in the action at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rychen v. Department of the Army</span>, 51 MSPR 179, 183 (1991). One of the many possible ways to make this showing is by establishing that the agency official taking the action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once an appellant shows that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's action, the agency must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 183-84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision in the present case, however, does not follow this analytical framework. Instead, the administrative judge simply concluded that the appellant's disclosures were not a contributing factor in the agency's decisions for the following reasons: The agency had no motive to retaliate against the appellant because it knew of the wrongdoing that the appellant was disclosing; agency witnesses testified that the appellant's conduct warranted disciplinary action; and the agency presented a logical and credible explanation for its decision to reassign the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In doing so, the administrative judge relied upon the evidence that the agency would use to show that it would have taken the action in the absence of the appellant's disclosure, to determine that the appellant did not show that retaliation was a contributing factor in the action at issue. This constitutes legal error, however, because, if the appellant establishes that retaliation was a contributing factor, the agency's evidence must be analyzed under the "clear and convincing" evidence standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rychen</span>, at 183-84.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board remained dissatisfied after the remand decision in <span class="Italic">Caddell</span> and again sent the case back for adjudication, as it explained the adjudicatory standards that the AJ should follow. The second Board decision made plain the distinction between the analysis of the appellant's burden of proof and the agency's burden of rebutting the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, <span class="Italic">Caddell v. DOJ</span>, 57 MSPR 508, 513-17 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the remand initial decision, the administrative judge first summarized the appellant's contentions regarding his suspension. The administrative judge stated that the appellant contended that both the proposing and deciding official were aware of the appellant's whistleblowing and took the suspension action against the appellant within a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in that action. The administrative judge then found that the agency did not "essentially dispute" the proposing and deciding officials' knowledge of the appellant's whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found, however, that "the fact that a proposal to suspend the appellant followed the alleged misconduct by some 3 months does not necessarily prove that the appellant's whistleblowing, which was even earlier, as a contributing factor in the agency's decision...[and] the mere fact that disciplinary action followed the appellant's confrontation with Marshal Cox is unconvincing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge then found that the length of time the agency took to suspend the appellant after he confronted Marshal Cox, the proposing and deciding officials' lack of a motive to retaliate, and the appropriateness of the appellant's suspension for the incident in question, convinced him that the appellant failed to establish that his whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the agency's <span id="Page_3959"></span>decision to suspend him. The administrative judge then went on to discuss additional evidence that demonstrated to him that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action against the appellant regardless of his whistleblowing activities. In this regard, the administrative judge found that the proposing and deciding officials were concerned about the possibility that a personnel action could be viewed as retaliation, and that they had no motive to retaliate against the appellant because they also sought Marshal Cox's removal from office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's analysis of the suspension claim is erroneous in several respects. First, the administrative judge's examination of the time between the alleged misconduct and the initiation and effectuation of the suspension as proof of whether the appellant met his initial burden of showing that his protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's action, misses the point. The relevant inquiry is the time between when the agency official taking the action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and the time that the action was taken. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McClellan v. Department of Defense</span>, 53 MSPR 139, 146 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision's analysis is also erroneous because, as in the first initial decision, it relies upon evidence that the agency would use to show that it would have taken the actions at issue against the appellant in the absence of his disclosures, to determine that the appellant did not show that retaliation was a contributing factor in his suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> 52 MSPR at 533-34. Relevant matters, such as the length of time the agency took to suspend the appellant after his confrontation with Marshal Cox, the proposing and deciding officials' lack of a motive to retaliate, and the appropriateness of the appellant's suspension for the confrontation, relate to the agency's evidentiary burden to show, under the stricter "clear and convincing" evidence standard, that it would have taken the action against the appellant in the absence of his disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, motive evidence may sometimes be properly considered in determining whether an appellant has met his initial burden of showing that reprisal was a contributing factor in the agency's decision. For example, in <span class="Italic">McDaid v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 46 MSPR 416, 421 (1990), the Board held that there are many possible ways for an appellant to show by preponderant evidence that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. There, the Board examined the issue of motive after first concluding that the appellant failed to show that the deciding officials, who had actual knowledge of the appellant's disclosure, acted within a time period reasonably evidencing a retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 422-23. Proof that the official taking the action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action, is sufficient, by itself, to satisfy the appellant's burden of proof on this issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 421. Motive became important to the appellant's showing in <span class="Italic">McDaid</span> only because he did not meet his burden under this other test. The absence of a motive to retaliate, however, does not overcome the conclusion that the appellant met his or her burden of proof unless it, along with other evidence, satisfies the agency's "clear and convincing evidence" burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, we find that the deciding official for the appellant's suspension learned in February or March of 1990, that the appellant had turned over documents to the U.S. Attorney's Office. He then suspended the appellant in July of that year. We hold that, in the circumstances here, this period of time was sufficiently short that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rychen</span>, 51 MSPR at 183. Applying the correct test to the facts of the present case, we therefore find that the appellant demonstrated that reprisal was a contributing factor in his suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of this determination, the question becomes whether the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 52 MSPR at 533. Although the administrative judge discussed some of the evidence relevant to this inquiry, he subjected that evidence to the appellant's lesser preponderant evidence standard, instead of the agency's higher "clear and convincing" standard. We are unable to correct this error on review, however, because the initial decision does not contain findings on all of the material issues presented in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Remand is appropriate for new findings and conclusions on all of the material issues presented in this case</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed earlier, we directed the administrative judge to specifically address the appellant's claim that the agency had a motive to retaliate against him because he went outside of the U.S. Marshals Service and made disclosures to the U.S. Attorney's Office. 52 MSPR at 534. Although the administrative judge found that the proposing and deciding officials had no motive to retaliate because they were not the subject of the appellant's whistleblowing and also sought Marshal Cox's removal, he did not fully address this aspect of the motive issue, as directed in our prior decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also directed the administrative judge to consider two affidavits submitted during the pendency of the appellant's prior petition for review, and to allow additional discovery and evidence that may be appropriate in light of this new evidence. 52 MSPR at 535 n.7. These affidavits, and resulting evidence, pertain to the appellant's claim that Marshal Cox contacted various agency officials, including those who suspended and reassigned him, in an attempt to remove him. Although the administrative judge mentioned the existence of such correspondence, and found it probative, he concluded that it was not persuasive because the proposing and deciding officials had no reason to retaliate against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's findings regarding the agency officials' lack of motive cannot be accepted, however, because they do not address the appellant's theory that the officials were motivated by the appellant's decision to go to the U.S. Attorney's Office, and by their involvement with Marshal Cox's attempt to have the appellant removed. Further, although we also directed the administrative judge to make credibility determinations that comport with the requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> the administrative judge totally credited the agency officials' testimonies on the basis of their lack of motive. The appellant, however, has identified numerous reasons for not crediting these testimonies, such as the witnesses' bias, internal inconsistencies, and inconsistencies with other evidence, that were not discussed by the administrative judge, as required under both <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> and <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further findings are also required as to the appellant's reassignment. With respect to this action, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show that whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to reassign him for the following reasons: (1) The appellant did not establish that the other employees in the office who were reassigned at the time of his reassignment were also whistleblowers; (2) the appellant's reassignment was a proper attempt to cure the factionalism in the appellant's office; (3) the non-whistleblowing managers who were not reassigned were not part of the factionalism; (4) although the position to which the appellant was reassigned had long been vacant, the agency had a real need to fill it; and (5) none of the agency officials involved in the appellant's reassignment had a motive to retaliate against the appellant because the appellant had already told them about Marshal Cox's alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing the reassignment issue in this regard, the administrative judge failed to follow the instructions contained in our earlier decision. In that decision, we specifically stated that the initial decision did not meet the requirements of <span class="Italic">Spithaler</span> because it did not address the appellant's claim that his protected activity was a contributing factor in the reassignment since the agency officials responsible for that action knew of his whistleblowing and took the action within a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that his disclosures were factors in the actions. We ordered the administrative judge to cure this deficiency. 52 MSPR at 534-35. The initial decision does not satisfy the Board's instructions with respect to this matter because it does not sufficiently identify the agency officials responsible for the actions, the time they learned of the appellant's whistleblowing, including the time that they learned when the appellant went to the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding Marshal Cox's alleged misconduct, and the time they decided to reassign him. Moreover, it once again considers factors relevant to the agency's burden of proof in deciding that the appellant did not meet his burden.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Although the exact substance of the appellant's disclosure is not included in the record, it is clear from the deciding official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis that she perceived him to be a whistleblower, thus satisfying one of the ways an appellant can establish the first element of a whistleblower affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See King v.

Thus, an appellant may satisfy the contributing factor standard by satisfying this knowledge/timing test<span class="Italic">. See Horton</span>, 66 F.3d at 283-84. The record evidence shows that the alleged retaliating official, the appellant's first-line supervisor, did not become the appellant's first line supervisor until after the protected disclosures were made. In a sworn declaration, the first-line supervisor stated that he was unaware that the appellant had been identified as a whistleblower at the time he issued the performance appraisal. While the appellant asserted that the first-line supervisor was aware of his claims against management, there is no record evidence of such an awareness. In addition, a period of at least 16 months elapsed between the last protected disclosure and the performance appraisal rating. Given these circumstances, we find that the knowledge/timing test has not been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The knowledge/timing test is not the only test for a contributing factor finding; the Board considers any relevant evidence on the contributing factor question, including the strength of the agency's evidence as to the reasons cited for taking the personnel action, whether the whistleblowing disclosure was personally directed at the proposing or deciding officials, and whether these individuals had a desire to retaliate against the appellant<span class="Italic">. See Sparks v. Department of the Interior</span>, 62 MSPR 369, 372 (1994). There is no record evidence that the first-line supervisor had a desire to retaliate against the appellant because of his protected disclosures. Moreover, the agency presented persuasive evidence that the appellant's lower rating was due to changes in his grade, performance standards, and supervisor. Therefore, we find that the appellant failed to demonstrate that his whistleblowing disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's performance appraisal rating....</p>

Here, the time between the appellant's protected disclosure in 2006 and the reduction of his clinical privileges in 2010 and performance award in 2011 exceeds four years. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly concluded under existing precedent that the time between the appellant's protected disclosure and the personnel actions was too great to meet the knowledge/timing test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also correctly stated that an appellant may still show a protected disclosure contributed to a personnel action through other circumstantial evidence such as the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the action, whether the whistleblowing was personally directed at the proposing or deciding officials, and whether those individuals had a desire or motive to retaliate against <span id="Page_3961"></span>the appellant.

However, he found neither of the appellant's current supervisors, who the appellant described as "'new'" were alleged to have been implicated in his disclosures or otherwise had a motive to retaliate. He further found that although the appellant alleged that his current supervisors made the decision on his clinical privileges and performance award with the "input and support" of other agency managers who were aware of his 2006 disclosures, he found this an unsupported "bare" allegation with no support in the record. He found that the appellant provided no detail to support the conclusory assertion that individuals with actual knowledge of his disclosures and motive to retaliate had any influence in either personnel action. These findings are supported by the record. Allegations lacking detail and not supported by affidavits or other evidence are not nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">See Marcino v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge noted that at least 4 years passed between the appellant's allegedly protected disclosure and the appellant's non-selection, and the Board has found that a personnel action taken within 1 to 2 years of a disclosure meets the knowledge/timing test; she then concluded that the appellant's non-selection occurred substantially outside this period. However, to the extent that the administrative judge implied that this length of time was dispositive of the issue of whether the appellant could potentially demonstrate that her alleged disclosures contributed to the personnel action in question, she erred. <span class="Italic">See Powers</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 156.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has alleged that she was informed that Ms. Lasater caused the appellant's non-selection by telling the selecting official that the appellant was "slow" and not a "team player."

In both 2005 and 2004, the 2 years preceding the appellant's resignation, she was rated in the highest category. In 2004, her appraisal specifically called her a "[t]eam player" who "[g]ets along well with coworkers."

In the absence of any evidence showing that Parsons was the selecting official or that any of the selecting officials had a motive to retaliate against the appellant, we find that he has failed to establish that his protected disclosure was a contributing factor in his being denied promotions.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Kahn</span>, 618 F.3d at 1316, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stated in dicta that, in an IRA appeal, even where the Board finds a contested merits issue dispositive, it should nevertheless resolve the remaining merits issues to expedite resolution of the case on appeal. However, if we assume, in this case, that the appellant showed that this protected disclosure was a contributing factor in his non-selection for promotions, we are simply unable to determine, based on the insufficiency of the record, including the appellant's failure to identify the agency officials involved, whether the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would not have selected him for the various positions even absent any whistleblowing. Under these circumstances, and because we are able to clearly resolve the contributing factor issue, we have determined not to pursue further analysis of this claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is no direct proof of knowledge of a disclosure by the proposing or deciding official, the Board evaluates other evidence under <span class="Italic">Dorney, supra,</span> but the Board may find the causation or connection lacking, <span class="Italic">Hearn v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...To the extent that the appellant claims that those officials had constructive knowledge of the disclosure, he must show that those with actual knowledge of his disclosure influenced the officials responsible for taking the action. <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Department of State</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 588, &#x00B6; 7 (2014). The appellant has not alleged, much less proven, that the agency officials to whom he made his disclosures, or who were otherwise aware of them, influenced the management officials involved in the underlying suspension action. For example, he has not alleged that those aware of his disclosures directed the proposing and deciding officials to take the suspension action against the appellant or that they were involved in the decision-making process in any way. Rather, his allegations are simply that the proposing and deciding officials had to have had actual knowledge of his disclosures. Accordingly, the appellant also has failed to establish constructive knowledge and, therefore, has failed to meet the knowledge/timing test to demonstrate contributing factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Dorney v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 15 (2012), if an appellant fails to satisfy the knowledge/timing test, the Board must consider other evidence, such as evidence pertaining to the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the whistleblowing was personally directed at the proposing or deciding official, and whether those individuals had a desire or motive to retaliate against the appellant. Here, based on the reasoning set forth in the initial decision, with which we agree, we find that the agency's evidence in support of its action was strong. Further, the appellant has not shown that his disclosures were directed at the proposing or deciding official, and that those officials otherwise had a desire or motive to retaliate against him. In sum, we find that the appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that other evidence supports a finding in this case that his disclosures were a contributing factor in his suspension....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the knowledge portion of the test, although the appellant has provided some additional context regarding the potential promotion and the discussions related thereto, she still has not identified any individual that she believes was responsible for preventing the promotion from taking place; so, it is unclear whether any of the agency officials allegedly responsible for denying the potential promotion are the same individuals <span id="Page_3962"></span>to whom the appellant alleges that she disclosed the needle-stick incident. The Board will not infer knowledge of an appellant's protected disclosures and activities to any agency official based only on a closeness in time between a disclosure or activity and a personnel action and the appellant's conclusory allegation that the action was retaliatory. <span class="Italic">See Kerrigan v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 833 F.3d 1349, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (noting that, even at the jurisdictional phase when the employee's burden is significantly lower than at the merits stage, it is not appropriate to infer knowledge on the part of any agency officials based only on the closeness in timing and the appellant's conclusory allegation that their actions were done in retaliation). Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant's allegation that the decision not to promote her was in retaliation for her disclosure, without identifying any of the individuals she believes were responsible for that decision, does not meet the nonfrivolous pleading standard required to establish jurisdiction over her IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See El v. Department of Commerce</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 76, &#x00B6; 6 (2015) (stating that vague, conclusory, unsupported, and <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations of alleged wrongdoing do not meet the nonfrivolous pleading standard needed to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 663 F. App'x 921 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">Keefer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 687, &#x00B6; 10 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The knowledge/timing test is not the only way for an appellant to satisfy the contributing factor element. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Dorney v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 15 (2012). If the appellant fails to satisfy that test, the Board must consider other evidence, such as that pertaining to the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the whistleblowing was personally directed at the proposing or deciding officials, and whether those individuals had a desire or motive to retaliate against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Dorney</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the same reasons discussed above, we also conclude that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the decision not to promote her was in retaliation for her disclosure, even considering evidence other than knowledge/timing evidence. Here, even if we are to take at face value the appellant's claim that she was promised a promotion that she subsequently never received, her conclusory allegation that the decision not to promote her was in retaliation for her disclosure, without more, makes it difficult to assess her claim. The additional email the appellant provided on review identifies the name of the proposed title change, but it does not provide any information regarding who was responsible for determining whether to grant the title change, identify any potential motive by any agency official for blocking the promotion, or offer an explanation for when or why the title change never came to fruition. Accordingly, we conclude that she also failed to nonfrivolously allege that the decision not to promote her was in retaliation for her protected disclosures, based on nonknowledge/timing evidence, such as the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for doing so or whether any agency official involved in the decision had a motive to retaliate against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other evidence, avoiding reliance on the timing/knowledge test, included mention by an agency official responsible for the challenged personnel action about what may be a long distant disclosure, <span class="Italic">de la Cruz MaGowan v. EPA</span>, 119 MSPR 9, 13-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2012 MSPB 120 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To satisfy the contributing factor criterion at the jurisdictional stage, an appellant need only raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the fact of, or content of, the protected disclosure was one factor that tended to affect the personnel action in any way. <span class="Italic">Mason v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 26 (2011). The administrative judge found that the passage of more than 7 years between the appellant's 2003 disclosure to the agency's OIG and the conversion of her approved sick leave to AWOL for absences on September 30 and October 1, 2010, was too long of an interval to satisfy the knowledge-timing test. Thus, the administrative judge determined that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that her 2003 disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to convert her approved sick leave to AWOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant alleged in her submissions below that when she requested a promotion in May 2010, Ms. Lowery specifically asked her about the 2003 OIG disclosure. Further, the appellant alleges that Ms. Lowery demanded the details of the disclosure and requested that the appellant provide her with a copy of the OIG report. Thus, the appellant alleged that her supervisor asked about that 2003 disclosure and then learned more about it approximately 6 months before taking the personnel action at issue. "Any weight given to a whistleblowing disclosure, either alone or in combination with other factors, can satisfy the contributing factor standard." <span class="Italic">Dorney v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 15 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1140 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 150, 156 (1995)). Therefore, the record reflects that the appellant did not engage in unsubstantiated speculation, but instead raised a material issue about the agency's reasons for its action. <span class="Italic">See Dorney</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 17. We therefore find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that her 2003 disclosure to the OIG was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to convert her approved sick leave for September 30 and October 1, 2010, to AWOL. Again, as noted above, in order to prove her claim on the merits, the appellant will need to establish by preponderant evidence that her allegedly protected disclosures were a contributing factor to the personnel action at issue in this IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Weed</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 21; <span class="Italic">see also Langer</span>, 265 F.3d at 1265.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Knowledge of past disclosures may, along with knowledge of more recent disclosures, establish the element of knowledge of a manager or managers sufficient to carry the appellant's burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Delgado v.
