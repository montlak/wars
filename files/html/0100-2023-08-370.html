<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-362"><span class="space">10.</span> Qualifications for Position; Exclusion From Consideration; Consideration of Experience; Multiple Referral Certificates</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">With the qualifications noted in the decisions that follow, veterans preference does not alone ordinarily affect the ability of an agency to establish qualifications for positions. When statutory preference is required, the appellant must still be qualified for the job to be considered for it. The appellant has no claim if the agency has a choice among grades and competitive certificates and does not select from the certificate that the appellant might have qualified for if that agency has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> basis for making its determination, <span class="Italic">Dale v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DALE_MICHAEL_K_PH_3443_05_0464_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246778.pdf">102 MSPR 646</a>, 651-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 2006 MSPB 225 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After fully considering the record, the AJ found that the appellant was <span id="Page_672"></span>not qualified at the GS-5 level because he lacked one year of specialized experience directly related to the position being filled. The appellant does not dispute this finding on petition for review. Nor does the appellant allege that he had the necessary education or combination of education and experience to qualify at the GS-5 level. The appellant merely alleges that he could have received a veterans recruitment appointment (VRA), and that, if he had received such an appointment, the agency would have been required to train him so that he could satisfy the GS-5 specialized experience requirement. However, the vacancy announcement for the Program Support Clerk position stated that applicants applying under this announcement would not be considered under the VRA. Thus, the appellant has not provided a basis for disturbing the AJ's findings that he was not qualified at the GS-5 level, and that the agency properly referred him on the GS-4 certificate, and not the GS-5 certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filled the Program Support Clerk position at the GS-5 level. Holmes testified that she decided to fill the position at the GS-5 level because the position was located in a remote outpatient clinic setting and she felt that only someone with the requisite specialized experience at the GS-5 level could work with the minimal supervision available there. She testified that she therefore only interviewed and considered candidates on the GS-5 certificate and did not even look at the GS-4 certificate. The appellant argues that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights when it placed him on the GS-4 certificate and then selected a candidate from the GS-5 certificate because he is a veteran and an alleged VRA candidate. The appellant has misconstrued VEOA. VEOA only prohibits an agency from denying a preference eligible the opportunity to compete; it does not provide that veterans will be considered for positions for which they are not qualified. <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). Here, the appellant was allowed to compete for the position he sought and his status as a preference eligible was fairly considered in the selection process. This is all that VEOA requires. <span class="Italic">See Smyth v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 219, &#x00B6; 7 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 41 Fed. Appx. 475 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The appellant has identified no veterans' preference statute or regulation which precluded the agency from filling the position at the higher of the two advertised grades, and we are unaware of any such statute or regulation. Therefore, we find that he has not shown that his nonselection for the Program Support Clerk position violated one or more of his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Easter v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (VEOA does not provide that veterans will be considered eligible for positions for which they are not qualified); <span class="Italic">Smyth</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 219, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the subject of qualifications and VEOA claims, <span class="Italic">Hopson v. VA,</span> AT-3330-10-0319-I-1 (NP 11/10/2010), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that "while the VEOA provides veterans the opportunity to compete for a position, it does not exempt them from the eligibility criteria...that are applicable to all candidates." <span class="Italic">Styslinger v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record reflects that, while the appellant was tentatively selected for the USAR Administrative Technician GS-5 position and the agency's February 11, 2011 email notified him that he was "being considered" for the position, so that the agency could verify his eligibility to be appointed to the position, the appellant had not yet been selected for the position because he was still required to submit copies of his DD-214 forms showing his active duty time and an OF-306 form. Although the appellant disagrees with the corrective action ordered by the administrative judge, we find the remedy appropriate in this case because it allowed the appellant to further compete for the GS-5 position by submitting his documentation so that the agency could determine whether he was eligible to be selected. As stated above, VEOA only prohibits the agency from denying the appellant the opportunity to compete for the position; VEOA does not provide that the appellant will be considered for positions for which he is not qualified. <span class="Italic">Dale</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts in its response to the appellant's petition that the appellant has submitted the documents as ordered by the administrative judge. The agency has determined, however, that the appellant does not meet two critical eligibility requirements, i.e., the appellant does not have Army Reserve membership and he is unable to obtain and maintain a security clearance. Specifically, the appellant is not serving in the United States Army Reserve as required by the dual status position[*], and the appellant was denied a security clearance on June 14, 2011. Thus, the record reflects that the agency provided the appellant the opportunity to compete for the position, and even though he was tentatively selected, the appellant was not offered the position because he does not meet the eligibility requirements. An individual whose veterans' preference rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) have been violated is not automatically entitled to the position sought; rather, such an individual is entitled to a selection process consistent with law. <span class="Italic">Dean v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant requests that the Board order the agency to reconstruct the selection process for the GS-7 USAR Unit Administrator position. To the contrary, the record reflects that the appellant competed for the GS-7 position and he did not score high enough to be referred to the selecting official. While the appellant apparently believes that he should have received a higher rating, the decision to give the appellant a score of 3 and not refer him to the selecting official is not reviewable by the Board, because the VEOA gives the Board no authority to adjudicate the merits of any action. <span class="Italic">Villamarzo</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 5. Instead, the VEOA authorizes the Board to determine only whether an agency, in connection with the action that is the subject of an appeal, has violated a statutory or regulatory provision relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, 5 U.S.C. chapter 33 sets forth the laws which control the examination, selection, and placement process in the civil service, including those provisions for individuals who qualify for veterans' preference. However, we have found no language in chapter 33 requiring an agency to select an individual with veterans' preference who does not meet the requirements of the position. Nor have we found any statutory language that precludes an agency from determining that an applicant has not met the required amount of specialized experience set forth in the vacancy announcement. In addition, the USAR Unit Administrator GS-7 position, like the USAR Administrative Technician GS-5 position, is a dual status position that requires the incumbent to obtain and maintain a security clearance, the same two qualifications that disqualified the appellant from eligibility for the USAR Administrative Technician, GS-5 position.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lazaro v. VA</span>, 666 F.3d 1316, 1316-21 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (on remand to MSPB, <span class="Italic">Lazaro v. VA</span>, AT-3330-10-1005-M-1 (NP 11/15/2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), following Board remand decision, <span class="Italic">Lazaro v. VA</span>, 565 Fed. Appx. 900 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>, explained that an agency must look beyond formal qualification requirements when it assesses the veteran's application for a position, and the case also explained that for certain positions the agency may not impose a requirement of a specific number of years of education when it evaluates a veteran's application; the case also determined that the Board has jurisdiction to determine whether an agency afforded an applicant the right to compete for a position and properly determined, in accordance with relevant veterans preference statutes or regulations, that the applicant was not qualified for the position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 10, 2009, Mr. Lazaro applied for an IT specialist position with the Miami VA Healthcare System. According to the Vacancy Announcement, to be qualified for this position, the applicant needed "[o]ne (1) year of specialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-9 level in the Federal Service...." The announcement explained that education could be used as a substitute for this experience, namely, a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree, or three full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree. On September 2, 2009, Mr. Lazaro was informed by letter that he was not considered for the position. Although Mr. Lazaro had fifty-three hours of relevant educational experience and at least six months of experience equivalent to the GS-9 level, the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") determined that he did not meet the specialized experience requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After exhausting his rights before the Department of Labor, on August 30, 2010, Mr. Lazaro filed an appeal with the Board under the VEOA, asserting that the VA violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veteran's preference when it did not select him for the position of IT specialist. In essence, Mr. Lazaro argued that the VA violated his preference rights when it determined that he did not meet the experience requirements for the IT specialist position. Specifically, Mr. Lazaro claimed that, given his veteran's preference eligibility, the VA was required to consider those experiences specified in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) (2011), one regulation among those implementing the law governing veteran's preference set forth in Title Five of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering Mr. Lazaro's arguments, the AJ concluded that the Board had no authority to review the VA's non-selection of Mr. Lazaro, and, therefore, denied his request for corrective action. Summarizing Mr. Lazaro's argument, the AJ stated, "the appellant believes that the agency did not properly evaluate his 'valuable experience,' by failing to credit work he performed while a GS-7 as experience at the GS-9 level." Relying upon <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 396 (2001), the AJ concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Mr. Lazaro's claim because his "argument challenges the merits of his non-selection," an issue the Board has no authority to adjudicate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the AJ's denial of his claims, Mr. Lazaro filed a petition for review of the Initial Decision. The Board concluded that "[w]e see no error in the administrative judge's analysis finding that the agency afforded the appellant consideration of all of his prior experience as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d)." Accordingly, the Board denied Mr. Lazaro's petition for review because it did not establish the existence of significant new evidence not presented to the Board, or that the AJ erred in interpreting a law or regulation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lazaro challenges the Board's denial of his petition for review of the AJ's Initial Decision, which denied his claim for corrective action on the grounds that the Board lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. The Board grants a petition for review when significant new, previously unavailable evidence is presented, or when the AJ based his decision on an erroneous interpretation of law or regulation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115. We must affirm the Board's decision to deny Mr. Lazaro's petition unless it is "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 359, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 390, preference eligible veterans receive advantages when seeking federal employment. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v. Cohen</span>, 333 U.S. 411, 418-19 (1948) ("The Veterans' Preference Act was accordingly adopted, creating special preference and protection for returning veterans at every stage of federal employment."). To enable veterans to receive these preference rights, Congress enacted statutes and authorized the Office of Personnel Management to adopt regulations related to the hiring of preference eligible veterans. <span class="Italic">See Joseph v. FTC</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (discussing the statutes and regulations enacted to provide veterans with their preference rights); <span class="Italic">MacLeod v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 280 Fed. Appx. 962, 964-65 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (unpublished decision). When a governmental agency fills a vacancy it must comply with these statutes and regulations. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1381-82; <span class="Italic">MacLeod</span>, 280 Fed. Appx. at 964-65. The VEOA provides preference eligible veterans with a right to file a claim for any agency hiring decision that violated the veteran's rights under a statute or regulation relating to veteran's preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the advantages received by preference eligible veterans is that an agency must comply with special statutes and regulations when it determines whether a veteran is qualified for a given position. <span class="Italic">See Kirkendall v. Dep't of Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184 (2008). For example, in determining whether a preference eligible veteran is qualified, the number of years of education completed by the veteran is not relevant. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b).[1] In other words, a preference eligible veteran cannot be deemed unqualified for a position because he lacks sufficient years of education. When experience is a factor in determining qualification for a position, moreover, a preference eligible veteran is entitled to be credited for all valuable experience, including experience gained "in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefor." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311 ("In examinations for the competitive service in which experience is an <span id="Page_675"></span>element of qualification, a preference eligible is entitled to credit...for all experience material to the position for which examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether he received pay therefor."). Despite these statutes and regulations, the VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_676"></span>(1)&#x2003;To further the policy stated in subsection (a) of this section, veterans referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be eligible, in accordance with regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe, for veterans recruitment appointments, and for subsequent career-conditional appointments, under the terms and conditions specified in Executive Order Numbered 11521 (March 26, 1970), except that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;such an appointment may be made up to and including the level GS-11 or its equivalent;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;a veteran shall be eligible for such an appointment without regard to the number of years of education completed by such veteran....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there were essentially two qualifications necessary for the IT specialist position: (1) a minimum level of education; and (2) "[o]ne (1) year of specialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-9 level in the Federal Service." Because of his preference, Mr. Lazaro satisfied the first criteria, regardless of his actual level of education. The VA determined, however, that Mr. Lazaro did not satisfy the second. On appeal, Mr. Lazaro argues that the VA violated his preference rights when it made that determination. He argues that the VA did not determine whether he was qualified in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) because it failed to consider some of his computer-related work experience. In response, the Government argues that the Board properly denied Mr. Lazaro's petition for review because the Board lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the VA violated Mr. Lazaro's preference rights when it determined that he was not qualified for the IT specialist position.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Lazaro does not contend that he has graduate-level education that can substitute for the required experience, nor does he contend that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b) would allow a substitution in the absence of such actual education. He simply argues that he has qualifying experience under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) that was never considered by the VA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is important to keep in mind that this case was decided on jurisdictional grounds, and that the AJ conducted no analysis with respect to the merits of Mr. Lazaro's claims under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d). While the Final Decision indicates that the Board found "no error" in the AJ's determination that the VA considered all of Mr. Lazaro's prior experience in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), the AJ never performed that analysis. First, the AJ concluded that Mr. Lazaro's appeal raised an issue the Board lacked jurisdiction to review. ("[W]hile I recognize that the appellant disagrees with that determination, the Board lacks jurisdiction to review the nonselection action on its merits."). Second, the AJ's only analysis with respect to the merits of Mr. Lazaro's non-selection considered whether the VA properly applied 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b) and <span class="Italic">not</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In light of this fact, we must determine whether the Board correctly determined that the AJ committed no legal error when he concluded that both he and the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Lazaro's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal brought under the VEOA, an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedies with the [Department of Labor] and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the action(s) at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veteran's preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a; <span class="Italic">Campion v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 326 F.3d 1210, 1213, 1215 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In this case, the only issue in dispute is whether Mr. Lazaro made a non-frivolous allegation that the VA violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veteran's preference. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that he has.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When experience is a factor in determining eligibility, an agency shall credit a preference eligible (1) with time spent in the military service of the United States if the position for which he/she is applying is similar to the position which he/she held immediately before his/her entrance into the military service; and (2) with all valuable experience, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefore.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no question that experience was a factor in determining whether Mr. Lazaro was eligible for the IT specialist position. This regulation, moreover, clearly relates to veteran's preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) ("[A]n agency shall credit <span class="Italic">a preference eligible</span>....") (emphasis added). It appears that the AJ and the Board concluded that they lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Lazaro's claims because they believed that addressing the merits of his claim would require the Board to address the "merits of his nonselection," which they believed fell outside the Board's jurisdiction. In support of this belief, both the AJ and the Board relied upon <span class="Italic">Ruffin</span>. This reliance was misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ruffin</span>, the Board held "that [it] has no authority to review, in a VEOA appeal, a claim of discrimination covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">Ruffin</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. at 401. In reaching this conclusion, the Board explained that, in a VEOA appeal, it has authority only to determine whether an agency's actions violated a veteran's preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Absent this nexus between the agency's action and a violation of a veteran's preference rights, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of an agency's personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 400. While this opinion contains sweeping language indicating that the issue in a VEOA appeal "is not whether a particular personnel action is proper and should be sustained," the opinion makes clear that this limitation is applicable only when the agency's personnel action did not relate to an alleged violation of a veteran's preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 400-01. In <span class="Italic">Ruffin</span>, for example, the appellant's age discrimination claim did not and could not give rise to a violation of a statute or regulation relating to veteran's preference. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the position urged by the Government, and accepted by the AJ and the Board, was correct, a veteran could never assert a claim within the jurisdiction of the Board because the only way to determine whether the agency violated the veteran's preference rights would be to analyze whether the agency properly took the veteran's preference rights into account when making its personnel decision, i.e., examining the merits of the agency's decision. There is simply no way to analyze whether a veteran's preference rights were violated without examining the grounds upon which the veteran's non-selection was predicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On at least two occasions, moreover, the Board has conducted exactly the type of analysis sought by Mr. Lazaro. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. at 187-90; <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 604, 606-08 (2003). In <span class="Italic">Clarke</span>, the appellant argued that he was not afforded the opportunity to compete for a position. 94 M.S.P.R. at 605-07. The AJ dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 605. While the Board ultimately denied the appellant's appeal, it concluded that the AJ erred by concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 607. The Board determined that the agency had not violated appellant's right to compete because the appellant was not qualified for the position and the appellant had failed to provide any evidence or arguments that he met the requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 608. In other words, the Board analyzed whether the appellant's preference rights were violated when the agency determined that he was not qualified for the position. The Board concluded that appellant's preference rights were not violated because he failed to provide any evidence or arguments suggesting that he was in fact qualified for the position, even under all preference-eligible criteria. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 607-08.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, the Board examined whether the agency violated appellant's right to compete by improperly concluding that he was not qualified for the position. 110 M.S.P.R. at 187. The Board explained that there was no evidence in the record that demonstrated that the agency had considered whether appellant's experience made him qualified for the position. Instead, "it appears from the agency's submission that it relied on the single fact that the appellant was a GS-6 to conclude that he did not have the minimum qualifications for a GS-8 position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 188. In light of this fact, the Board remanded the case, instructing the AJ to "direct the agency to provide evidence and argument explaining whether it considered the possibility that, for the GS-8 position, the appellant's prior work experience qualified as specialized experience of 1 year equivalent to the next lower grade level." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 190. This inquiry is nearly identical to that sought by Mr. Lazaro.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record indicates that the Human Resources Specialist who reviewed Mr. Lazaro's application concluded that Mr. Lazaro did not meet the specialized experience requirements for the position because his "experience as an assistant Automated Data Processing Applications Coordinator for 6 months...did not fulfill the experience requirements for the position at the GS-11 level." There is no reference in the record indicating that Mr. Lazaro's other valuable experience was considered in accordance with CFR &#x00A7; 302.302(d). Mr. Lazaro argues at length, moreover, that, if his experience is taken into account, he is qualified for the position. On the basis of these arguments and the evidence submitted by Mr. Lazaro, we conclude that the Board has jurisdiction to determine whether the VA properly afforded Mr. Lazaro the right to compete for the IT specialist job and properly determined, in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), that Mr. Lazaro was not qualified for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board committed legal error by concluding that the AJ properly determined that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Lazaro's claim and that the AJ's analysis was not erroneous. Because the record contains insufficient evidence for this court to determine whether Mr. Lazaro's claims have merit, and because his claims have not been addressed on the merits by either the AJ or the Board, we vacate and remand this case for further consideration in accordance with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Board decided that Mr. Lazaro was not qualified for the <span id="Page_677"></span>position he sought, <span class="Italic">Lazaro v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management's "Individual Qualification Standard for Information Technology (IT) Management Series, 2210 (Alternative A)," provides the following information regarding the specialized experience required for IT positions in grades GS-7 and above:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Specialized Experience for GS-7 (or equivalent) and Above:</span> Positions at GS-7 (or equivalent) and above require one year of specialized experience at the next lower GS-grade (or equivalent). Specialized experience is experience that has equipped the applicant with the particular competencies/knowledge, skills, and abilities to successfully perform the duties of the position and is typically in or related to the work of the position to be filled. Such experience is typically gained in the IT field or through performance of work where the primary concern is IT. The employing agency is responsible for defining the specialized experience based on the requirements of the position being filled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's vacancy announcement listed the following specialized experience requirement for the GS-2210-11 position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">A. Specialized Experience:</span> One (1) year specialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-9 level in Federal Service is required. Specialized experience is experience that demonstrates accomplishment of computer project assignments that required a range of knowledge of computer requirements and techniques. For example, *Knowledge of the customary approaches, techniques, and requirements appropriate to an assigned computer applications area or computer specialty area in an organization; *Planning the sequence of actions necessary to accomplish the assignment where this entailed coordination with others outside the organizational unit and development of project controls; and *Adaptation of guidelines or precedents to the needs of the assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The vacancy announcement instructed applicants to address in writing the specified knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) the applicant would need to possess to be able to successfully perform the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted evidence and argument showing that, when it initially considered the appellant's application, it credited and considered all of the valuable experience reflected in the appellant's application for the position, yet determined that the information he submitted did not satisfy the 1-year-of-specialized-experience requirement through education or experience. In particular, the agency provided a declaration from the Human Resources Specialist who reviewed the appellant's application. The Human Resources Specialist provided a detailed and persuasive explanation as to why he found the appellant not qualified for the position. Based on all of the evidence in the record, we find that the agency properly afforded the appellant the right to compete for the IT Specialist position and properly determined, in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), that he was not qualified for the position. <span class="Italic">See Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1319, 1321 (VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified); <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (VEOA does not exempt veterans from meeting the minimum qualification standards for a position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Back to the Federal Circuit. This time the court affirmed the Board's decision that no VEOA violation resulted from Mr. Lazaro's failure to secure the VA job, <span class="Italic">Lazaro v. VA</span>, 565 Fed. Appx. 900, 901-05 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 10, 2009, Mr. Lazaro, a preference eligible veteran, applied for an Information Technology (IT) specialist position with the Miami VA Healthcare System. The vacancy announcement for this position described its "qualification requirements" as "[o]ne (1) year [of] specialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-9 level in [the] Federal Service." The announcement also stipulated that certain levels of education could be substituted for this year of "specialized experience," namely, a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree, or three full years of progressively higher level graduate education leading to a Ph.D. or equivalent doctoral degree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 30 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b), Mr. Lazaro was eligible for certain veterans' preferences. Mr. Lazaro's application stated that he had six months of experience as a medical coder at the GS-7 level with collateral duties as an assistant Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC). His application also specified that he had fifty-three credits of relevant educational experience. Finally, in the "Other Qualifications" section of his application, Mr. Lazaro indicated that he had experience as a "Computer Repair Tech[nician] " and had received "various incentive awards." The Human Resources Specialist who reviewed Mr. Lazaro's application concluded that his experiences and education level fell short of the full year of specialized experience at the GS-9 level, or the educational equivalent thereof, necessary for the IT Specialist position. Accordingly, on September 2, 2009, Mr. Lazaro was informed by letter that he was not considered for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 30, 2010, after exhausting his rights before the Department of Labor, Mr. Lazaro filed an appeal with the Board, asserting that the VA violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) when it did not select him for the position of IT specialist. The Administrative Judge (AJ) concluded that the Board lacked authority to review the merits of the agency's non-selection of Mr. Lazaro. The Board affirmed, and Mr. Lazaro appealed to this court. Reversing, we explained that "[t]here is simply no way to analyze whether a veteran's preference rights were violated without examining the grounds upon which the veteran's non-selection was predicated." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1320. We then remanded Mr. Lazaro's case to the Board for further consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the Board allowed the parties to submit supplemental evidence and argument regarding the propriety of the agency's determination. The government submitted an additional declaration from the Human Resources Specialist that reviewed Mr. Lazaro's application, and Mr. Lazaro submitted additional documentation of his qualifications for the position at issue--documentation which he did not include in his original application. On November 15, 2012, after reviewing the additional information presented, the Board denied Mr. Lazaro's petition for review. The Board concluded that the declaration of the Human Recourses Specialist was credible, and "any asserted prior experience that the appellant raised for the first time on appeal" was "irrelevant because the appellant did not include it in his application for the position." Mr. Lazaro filed an appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must affirm the Board's decision to deny Mr. Lazaro's petition unless it is "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in our previous decision, the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 359, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 390, gives preference eligible veterans certain advantages when seeking federal employment. <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 5 F.3d at 1318 (citing <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Cohen</span>, 333 U.S. 411, 418-19 (1948)). In particular, agencies must comply with special statutes and regulations when determining whether a particular veteran is qualified for a given position. <span class="Italic">See Kirkendall v. Dep't of Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184, 189 (2008). For example, when experience is a factor in determining qualification for a posted position, a preference eligible veteran is entitled to be credited for all of his valuable experience, including experience gained "in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefor." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) ("In examinations for the competitive service in which experience is an element of qualification, a preference eligible is entitled to credit...for all experience material to the position for which examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether he received pay therefor."). If an agency hiring decision violates these rights, preference eligible veterans may secure relief by filing a claim challenging the agency's decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, only one qualification is at issue: whether Mr. Lazaro possesses "[o]ne (1) year [of] specialized experience equivalent to at least the GS-9 level in [the] Federal Service [or the educational equivalent thereof]." Mr. Lazaro continues to argue that the VA did not comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) in determining his qualifications, and therefore violated his opportunity to compete for the IT Specialist position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the remand proceedings, the agency submitted an additional declaration from the Human Resources Specialist who reviewed Mr. Lazaro's application and accompanying documents, John Mondragon. The declaration averred that Mr. Mondragon fully reviewed Mr. Lazaro's application, including Mr. Lazaro's six months of experience as a medical coder, his experience as an assistant ADPAC, his various awards, and his experience as a Medical Specialist in the Army. Mr. Mondragon also examined Mr. Lazaro's educational achievements, including his certification of completion for a VA Learning University (VALU) Course for Basic Networking and 53 hours of study at Miami Dade College. Despite these achievements, Mr. Mondragon ultimately concluded that Mr. Lazaro was "unable to substitute education...for experience."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that Mr. Mondragon's declaration constituted a "detailed and persuasive explanation as to why he found the appellant not qualified for the position." Relying on Mr. Mondragon's statement as well as other evidence, the Board held that the agency properly "credited and considered all of the valuable experience reflected in the appellant's application for the position," and "properly determined, in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), that [Mr. Lazaro] was not qualified for the position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lazaro has not submitted any evidence contradicting these findings. <span id="Page_678"></span>The Board's finding that the declaration is credible and indicates that the agency considered all of Mr. Lazaro's relevant experience in accordance with &#x00A7; 302.302(d) is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lazaro also argues that the Board erroneously rejected as irrelevant evidence of Mr. Lazaro's qualifications that he failed to submit with his original job application but presented to the Board on appeal. Specifically, Mr. Lazaro contends that the Board should have considered a certificate for 600 hours of work experience as a microcomputer technician that he presented on appeal to the Board. The government argues that this document should not be considered because Mr. Lazaro failed to submit it with his application for the position at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lazaro asserts that he did not submit the certificate documenting his 600 hours of work as a microcomputer technician with his application because the government form he completed to apply for the IT Specialist position, Form 612, instructed him not to send documentation unless requested. Form 612 reads in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Other Qualification: Job-related training courses (give title and year). Job-related skills (other languages, computer software/hardware, tools, machinery, typing speed, etc.). Job-related honors, awards, and special accomplishments (publication, membership in professional/honor societies, leadership activities, public speaking and performance awards). <span class="Italic">Give dates, but do not send documents unless requested</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on these directions, Lazaro simply wrote "Computer Repair Tech., Basic Networking, Various Incentive Awards," in the space directly below these instructions.[3] He now contends that he "was never afforded the opportunity to submit all of his additional supporting documents because he was following the instructions stated on Form 612[ ] Section G 'Do not send your documentation unless requested.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Additional space for descriptions of qualifications was provided on following page of Form 612.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the agency nor the Board is required to consider work experience that the veteran did not describe in accordance with the agency's instructions in his application. Form 612 provided Mr. Lazaro with sufficient opportunity to describe his 600 hours of work as a computer technician and, indeed, expressly requested that he list the dates of such experience. Despite these instructions, Mr. Lazaro failed to communicate the nature and length of his work experience in a way that would enable an official reviewing his application to evaluate it. Although Form 612 requests that the applicant not send documentation unless requested, this instruction does not excuse the appellant's failure to provide an adequate description of his relevant experiences and the corresponding dates. The agency's decision not to hire Mr. Lazaro must be evaluated based on the information he provided to the agency. The government was not required to investigate Mr. Lazaro's perfunctory and dateless description of his "other qualifications."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Lazaro appears to contest the qualifications of the veteran who eventually received the IT Specialist position. The qualifications of the veteran whom the agency hired are irrelevant to this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> was interpreted by <span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span>, 640 Fed. Appx. 861, 863-64 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Jones argues that the agency did not credit his experience when reviewing his applications for the four HHS positions. Under the VEOA, agencies are required to give a preference-eligible veteran credit for "all experience material to the position for which examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether he received pay therefor." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d). The Board's role in a VEOA appeal is limited: "the VEOA does not empower the Board to supplant the [agency's] criteria with its own." <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. 2015-3123, 629 Fed. Appx. 956 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 13, 2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Jones argues that <span class="Italic">Lazaro v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2012), stands for the proposition that in a VEOA appeal, the Board must independently review whether the agency properly weighed a veteran's experiences. <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, however, does not stand for that proposition. <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> addresses the situation in which an agency fails to take into account all of the veteran's experiences. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1321 ("the record indicates...that Mr. Lazaro did not meet the specialized experience requirements for the position because his 'experience as an assistant Automated Data Processing Applications Coordinator for 6 months did not fulfill the experience requirements for the position at GS-11 level.' There is no reference in the record indicating that Mr. Lazaro's other valuable experience was considered...."). In this case, the Board found that HHS had reviewed all of Mr. Jones's recited experiences when reviewing his applications for the four positions at issue, and Mr. Jones has not shown that finding to be erroneous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span>, 718 Fed. Appx. 958, 960 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> circuit court decision resulted in a remand in <span class="Italic">Beyers v. Dept. of State</span>, 505 Fed. Appx. 951, 953-54 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) (on remand, <span class="Italic">Beyers v. Dept. of State</span>, 120 MSPR 573, 2014 MSPB 8 (2014), <span class="Italic">post</span>)), distinguishing evaluation of an applicant's experience and his suitability for a position:<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government appears to argue that, even if the Board incorrectly relied on law of the case, the Board should be affirmed because petitioner's suitability claims do not state a claim under the VEOA. We agree that the VEOA does not generally accord any special treatment to veterans who are deemed unsuitable to hold a particular position. <span class="Italic">See Lazaro v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("[T]he VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified."). We also note that, as a general matter, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the merits of suitability determinations that result in an employee's non-selection. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, Beyers can establish a VEOA claim if he successfully "alleges that [the] agency has violated [his] rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A). We have recently held in <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> that, in the context of a VEOA claim, "the Board has jurisdiction to determine whether [an agency] afforded [the petitioner] the right to compete for [a position] and properly determined, in accordance with [relevant veterans preference statutes or regulations], that [the petitioner] was not qualified for the position." 666 F.3d at 1321. We think the question as to whether the Board may (or must) similarly address suitability issues in the context of the petitioner's VEOA claim is an issue best addressed in the first instance by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand the Board denied relief, determining in <span class="Italic">Beyers v. Dept. of State</span>, 120 MSPR 573, 575-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12, 2014 MSPB 8 (2014) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Beyers v. Dept. of State</span>, 593 Fed. Appx. 980 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP)), that veterans preference rights were not violated when a candidate was barred from further consideration based on an unfavorable suitability determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights under 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3941(c) and 22 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 11.20(a)(4) when it delayed a final decision on his application while non-veterans were being hired for a limited number of existing positions, issued a negative suitability determination, incorrectly described his alleged poor social skills and a client complaint as "employment misconduct," ignored his submissions contravening the evidence underlying the suitability determination, failed to follow its own procedures and policy in denying his agency appeal, and denied his internal agency appeal of the suitability determination. Section 3941(c) states that "[t]he fact that an applicant for appointment as a Foreign Service officer candidate is a veteran or disabled veteran shall be considered an affirmative factor in making such appointments." 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3941(c). Section 11.20(a)(4) states that "[v]eterans' preference shall apply to the selection and appointment of Foreign Service specialist career candidates." 22 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 11.20(a)(4). The appellant alleged that the agency's actions denied him affirmative consideration for the position and constituted an inappropriately narrow construction of sections 3941(c) and 11.20(a)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, during the Board appeal process, the appellant was given a full and fair opportunity to show that the agency failed to follow sections 3941(c) and 11.20(a)(4). The agency's submissions include documentary evidence related to its hiring process in this matter. The record shows that the appellant simply failed to meet all qualifications for the Foreign Service position for which he applied. On passing the Foreign Service examination, he received a <span class="Italic">conditional</span> offer of employment <span class="Italic">contingent upon</span> satisfactory security, medical, and suitability clearances. The background investigation turned up suitability issues. The Final Review Panel, which evaluates candidates for suitability for appointment to the Foreign Service, concluded that he was not suitable for the position. The Appeals Committee of the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service upheld that decision, and his candidacy was thus terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Had the appellant been found suitable and thus met all qualifications for employment, the appropriate number of points reflecting his status as a veteran would have been added to his examination score pursuant to the agency's procedures, and his name would have been placed on the rank-ordered register from which the agency hires. He never reached that point in the application process because he was found unsuitable, that is, unqualified for the position. "VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, <span id="Page_679"></span>666 F.3d at 1319. The record evidence does not suggest that the agency improperly concluded that he was unqualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant sought to show that the agency should have given him an "affirmative factor preference" in determining his qualifications for the position at issue. The appellant, however, has not identified any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference allowing an agency to disregard findings made during a suitability determination that would otherwise disqualify a preference eligible. The statute upon which the appellant relied, 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3941(c), states that status as a veteran is an "affirmative factor" in hiring. The regulation he cited, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 11.20(a)(4), states that "[v]eterans' preference shall apply to the selection and appointment of Foreign Service specialist career candidates." Neither section specifies when veterans' preference points must be added, or whether the "affirmative factor" of status as a preference eligible would offset an applicant's inability to meet all qualifications for employment. Neither creates specific obligations for the agency with respect to the assessment of suitability of preference eligibles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances here clearly differ from cases where agencies have failed to heed specific statutes or regulations relating to veterans' preference that require, for example, a more generous assessment of the qualifications of preference eligibles who apply for positions. In <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, the Federal Circuit remanded the appeal to the Board to determine whether the agency had properly assessed the appellant's qualifications under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311, and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d). <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1318-21. These provisions require agencies to consider preference eligible candidates who have not attained the minimum level of education required for some positions and to credit those candidates with all experience material to the position, even if such experience is unpaid. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1318-19 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311; 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, the Board remanded the appeal in part to determine whether the agency had considered whether the appellant's listed experience would satisfy the requirements for the GS-8 level position set forth in the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Operating Manual for Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (2008). It appeared from the agency's documentary submission that the agency "relied on the single fact that the appellant was a GS-6 to conclude that he did not have the minimum qualifications for a GS-8 position," which the Board concluded was improper. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. In <span class="Italic">Isabella v.

In <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, the Board denied the appellant's claim for corrective action on the grounds that the Board lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. Because the appeal was denied on jurisdictional grounds, the Board conducted no analysis with respect to the merits of Mr. Lazaro's claims under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d). The court found, however, that "[t]here is simply no way to analyze whether a veteran's preference rights were violated without examining the grounds upon which the veteran's non-selection was predicated." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1320. Thus, the court remanded the case for the Board to consider whether the agency properly afforded Mr. Lazaro "the right to compete" by considering all of his valuable experience. Here, however, after finding that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's claim, the administrative judge analyzed the application requirements for the Logistics Management Specialist position, i.e., submission of a resume and assorted documents and the determination by a specialist as to whether the applicant met the quality ranking factors, and the administrative judge determined that the agency disqualified the appellant because his resume failed to show that he met the quality ranking factors. Thus, the administrative judge provided the appellant the analysis of the application process that he is entitled to receive. <span class="Italic">See Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 132-21.</p>

The appellant does not challenge this finding on review and we agree with the administrative judge that the record does not reflect that the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights in considering his experience material to the position at issue and in determining that his lack of such experience indicated that he was not qualified for the position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Among the several preferences extended to preference-eligible veterans in federal employment is the right "to credit for all experience material to the position for which examined, including experience gained in religious, civic welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether [the preference-eligible applicant] received pay therefor." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d).

Section 3311 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), therefore, are a statute and a regulation, respectively, "relating to veterans' preference" which may form the basis of a VEOA appeal before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Slater v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant does not have a right to a hearing in a VEOA appeal, we agree with the administrative judge that there existed material facts in dispute which necessitated a hearing in this case. <span class="Italic">See Haasz</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.

The administrative judge found that the appellant did not meet this burden, and, on petition for review, the appellant argues that the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v.

In opposition, the agency argues that the administrative judge applied <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> correctly when he found no violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) based upon the agency's witnesses' testimony that they reviewed and considered the entirety of the appellant's application materials in assessing his qualifications for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency's argument and find that the administrative judge properly applied <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, 573 F.3d at 1324-25, and <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1318-19, in denying the appellant's request for corrective action. The appellant urges that <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> and <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> be read broadly to provide a preference-eligible job applicant with a substantive right to have the Board undertake a qualitative review of an agency's assessment of his experiences and qualifications. We find the more accurate reading of these cases establishes that, although a preference-eligible is entitled to have a broad range of experiences considered by the agency in reviewing his application for a position, how the agency adjudges and weighs those experiences is beyond the purview of the Board's review in a VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Asatov v. Agency for International Development</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 692, &#x00B6; 7 (2013) (the matter at issue in a VEOA appeal is not whether a particular agency action is proper and should be sustained); <span class="Italic">Scharein v.

Cir. Jan. 10, 2008) (NP). Accordingly, we find that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), the Board is limited to assessing whether an agency considered all of an appellant's "valuable experience" which is material to the position for which the appellant has applied, and we conclude that this assessment does not include a review of the weight the agency gave to a preference-eligible's prior experiences in determining that he was not qualified for a position of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we find that the facts of <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> and <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> do not support the reading of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) that the appellant urges us to adopt on review. In both cases, the issues presented concerned the hiring-agencies' failures to consider certain portions or segments of the applicants' work histories. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, the appellant asserted that the agency failed to consider his military experience in connection with his application for employment because that experience was not included on his formal application but rather was included in documentation appended to his application. <span class="Italic">See</span> 574 F.3d at 1323. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, the appellant argued that computer-related work he had performed with the agency at the GS-7 level constituted qualifying experience for a GS-9 level position, but that the agency never considered that experience. <span class="Italic">See</span> 666 F.3d at 1317, 1319 &#x0026; n.2. In <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, the Federal Circuit found that the appellant had established a violation of VEOA and remanded the appeal to the Board for a determination of the proper remedial relief, <span class="Italic">see</span> 574 F.3d at 1325, and in <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, it found that the appellant's allegations of a VEOA violation established jurisdiction over his appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> 666 F.3d at 1321. In neither case, however, did the appellants argue that their prior experiences were judged, weighed, or assessed improperly or inadequately by the hiring agencies. We therefore disagree with the appellant's argument that a preference-eligible has a substantive right to the Board's review of how a hiring agency assessed his prior experiences and qualifications under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) in a VEOA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we note that the Board does not undertake a substantive review of whether an agency should have hired a preference-eligible in other VEOA appeals, and we find that undertaking such a substantive review of how the agency judged the appellant's prior qualifications and experiences in this case would be inconsistent with the Board's role under VEOA. For example, in a VEOA appeal where a preference-eligible argues that he was not credited with his 10-point preference in applying for a federal position, the Board does not reach the substantive question of whether the preference-eligible should have been hired, but instead focuses on the more limited question of whether he was fully credited with his veterans' preference during the selection process. <span class="Italic">See Russell v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2012). If the Board finds such a violation occurred, it generally will order the hiring agency to reconstruct its hiring process rather than appoint the preference-eligible to the position in question. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Gingery v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 354, &#x00B6; 14 (the agency's violation of the appellant's VEOA rights by failing to consider his application entitles him to a lawful selection process, not to an appointment), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 480 F. App'x 588 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">cf. Marshall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 587 F.3d 1310, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (appointment is the appropriate remedy where it is clear that the preference-eligible would have been appointed absent the veterans' preference violation). Similarly, in a right to compete VEOA appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), the Board does not determine whether a preference-eligible is qualified for a particular position of federal employment or whether he should have been selected for the position in question, but rather only assesses whether the preference-eligible was permitted to compete for the position on the same basis as other candidates. <span class="Italic">Harellson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 534, &#x00B6; 11 (2010); <span class="Italic">see Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (an agency "is not required to hire a preference-eligible veteran if...it does not believe that the candidate is qualified or possesses the necessary experience"); <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 13 (2006) (VEOA does not provide that a veteran will be considered for a position for which he is not qualified). In such an appeal, moreover, a preference-eligible's right to compete does not preclude an agency from eliminating a veteran or preference-eligible from further consideration for a position based on his qualifications for the position, and nothing requires that the veteran or preference-eligible be considered at every stage of the selection process, up to that process's final stage. <span class="Italic">Harellson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 534, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_681"></span>Here, we find that it would be inconsistent with the Board's role under VEOA to engage in a fact-based review of how an agency weighed and assessed a preference-eligible's experiences in making its hiring decisions and determinations about the preference-eligible's qualifications for a position of employment. Rather, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), we conclude the Board's role is limited to determining whether the hiring agency improperly omitted, overlooked, or excluded a portion of the appellant's experiences or work history in assessing his qualifications for the vacancy, and the Board will not reevaluate the weight the agency accorded those experiences in reaching its decision that the appellant was not qualified for a given position of employment. <span class="Italic">See Kirkendall</span>, 573 F.3d at 1324 ("Section 3311(2) guarantees that any experience of a veteran that is material to the position for which the veteran is examined will be credited. At the very least, 'credited' means 'considered.'") (citation omitted). VEOA does not empower the Board to reevaluate the merits of an agency's ultimate determination that a preference-eligible veteran is not qualified for a position with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1384-85; <span class="Italic">see also Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have carefully reviewed the administrative judge's initial decision; we agree that the agency credited the appellant with all of his valuable experience material to the Associate Professor position; and we find that the appellant cannot demonstrate that the agency failed to consider or omitted any of his prior experiences under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d). The record reflects that the agency dutifully and thoroughly considered the appellant's work history, and there is no evidence in the record that the agency omitted, overlooked, or refused to consider any of the appellant's teaching or military experiences in reaching its conclusion that he was not qualified for the Associate Professor position, <span class="Italic">cf. Kirkendall</span>, 573 F.3d at 1324 (finding a veterans' preference violation when information "was simply ignored...because it had not been printed in the two-page, self-made application that [the appellant] submitted"); <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (finding that the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it failed to credit him with his veterans' preference as reflected on his SF-50). This finding is reinforced by the fact that the agency solicited additional information from the appellant, which it considered in making its hiring decision. The appellant, moreover, does not dispute that he does not have the educational background in education, leadership, management, or organizational behavior as specified in the job announcement, and he has failed to identify any of his experiences (military or civilian) which the agency overlooked or failed to consider in finding him not qualified for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, as a preference-eligible veteran, was entitled to be credited with "all valuable experience" by the agency in its assessment of his experience for the Associate Professor position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d).

The administrative judge's initial decision denying the appellant's request for corrective action under VEOA is AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 4214 of Title 38 is not a generally applicable veterans' preference statute which exempts all preference-eligibles from satisfying a minimum education requirement imposed by OPM.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not cited by the administrative judge in his initial decision, in conducting our review of the issues presented by the appellant, we have considered the Federal Circuit's statement in <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> that "in determining whether a preference-eligible veteran is qualified, the number of years of education completed by the veteran is not relevant." 666 F.3d at 1318 &#x0026; n.1 (citing 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4212(b)).

The text of section 4214 provides in relevant part that "[t]he United States has an obligation to assist veterans of the Armed Forces in readjusting to civilian life," and that "veterans constitute a uniquely qualified recruiting source" for federal employment. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a). "To further the policy stated in [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a)], veterans referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be eligible, in accordance with regulations which [OPM] shall prescribe, for veterans recruitment appointments, and for subsequent career-conditional appointments" subject to certain limitations. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1). These limitations are, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that veterans recruitment appointments "may be made up to and including the level GS-11 or its equivalent," and that "a veteran shall be eligible for such a [veterans recruitment] appointment without regard to the number of years of education completed by such veteran." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(A), (B). OPM's regulations addressing veterans recruitment appointments are located at 5 C.F.R. part 307, and specify that a veterans recruitment appointment under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b) is an excepted appointment in the competitive service which may only be made to a GS-11 or lower level position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.101-.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4214(b)'s proscription on considering the number of years of a veteran's education in assessing his qualifications for a position of employment, therefore, is limited to veterans recruitment appointments and is not a generally applicable statute limiting an agency's assessment of all preference-eligible job applicants. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.103. Although 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214 and OPM's implementing regulations are a statute and regulations relating to veterans' preference, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a, the appellant has not argued that he was, or should have been, appointed to the Associate Professor position with the agency under this specialized appointment authority. We find, moreover, that, because the Associate Professor position at issue in this appeal was a GS-14 level position, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b) is not applicable to the appellant's instant VEOA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the foregoing, we find the Board's recent statement in <span class="Italic">Beyers</span> that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b) "require[s] agencies to consider preference-eligible candidates who have not attained the minimum level of education required for some positions," 120 M.S.P.R. 573, &#x00B6; 11, is limited to veterans recruitment appointments. <span class="Italic">See Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1318 &#x0026; n.1. We thus clarify <span class="Italic">Beyers</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 573, &#x00B6; 11, to reflect that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b) does not exempt all preference-eligibles from satisfying the minimum education requirements for a position which OPM has established pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308, and we emphasize that section 4214(b)(1)(B)'s exemption from a minimum education requirement only applies to veterans recruitment appointments under 5 C.F.R. part 307.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Miller v. FDIC</span>, 818 F.3d 1361, 1365-68 (2016), recounting Mr. Miller's qualifications and experience, and the procedural history leading to the Board appeal, but the court explained that while it was affirming the result, "[p]recedent requires that the Board determine whether the record was adequately considered by the agency":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (VPA), Pub. L. No. 359, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 390, established the principle of veterans' preference, whereby preference eligible veterans receive certain advantages when seeking federal employment. The VPA is codified in scattered sections of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lazaro v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (discussing some of the statutes and regulations enacted to provide veterans with their preference rights); <span class="Italic">Joseph v. FTC</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (same). The VEOA provides preference eligible veterans with an administrative challenge to an agency hiring decision that a veteran believes violates a veteran's rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Federal agencies generally use two types of selection to fill vacancies: (1) the open 'competitive examination' process and (2) the 'merit promotion' process." <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1381 (citations omitted). The competitive examination process is typically open to the public. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.101. The merit promotion process is used when the position is to be internally filled by a current agency employee or a "status" applicant, such as a preference-eligible veteran. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(1). Veterans receive certain advantages under both processes, but the advantages differ. An agency may accept applications under both procedures and retains "the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method." <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1384 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In competitive examination procedures, "an agency must comply with special statutes and regulations when it determines whether a veteran is qualified for a given position." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1318. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2), when experience is a factor in determining eligibility for a competitive service position, preference eligible veterans are entitled to "credit" "for all experience material to the position." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), "an agency shall credit a preference eligible...with all valuable experience." Despite these provisions, precedent has recognized that "the VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1319.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Miller argues that the Board misinterpreted the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d) that an agency must "credit" a preference eligible veteran "for all experience material to the position for which examined." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2). He argues that the Board applied <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> incorrectly in holding that the Board's role "is limited to determining whether the hiring agency improperly omitted, overlooked, or excluded a portion of the appellant's experiences or work history," <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. at 96. In response, the FDIC argues that the <span id="Page_682"></span>VEOA does not authorize the Board to conduct a substantive review of a preference eligible veteran's qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board stated that its "role is limited to determining whether the hiring agency improperly omitted, overlooked, or excluded a portion of the appellant's experience or work history in assessing his qualifications for the vacancy." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. at 96. MSPB review is not so limited. The VEOA, the MSPB statute and regulations, and Federal Circuit and Board precedent all indicate that not only must the MSPB determine whether the experience record was complete, but it must also assess whether that record was adequately considered by the agency. The FDIC is correct that the VEOA does not authorize the MSPB to conduct, on appeal, a substantive review of the veteran's qualifications and adjudicate the correctness of the agency's hiring decision. But the MSPB must assure that the veteran's experience and work history were actually considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides preference eligible veterans with a right to challenge agency hiring decisions that violate a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330(a). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2), when experience is a factor in determining eligibility, preference eligible veterans are entitled to "credit" "for all experience material to the position." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d), "an agency shall credit a preference eligible...with all valuable experience." We have recognized that "the VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1319. <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> illustrates the operation of the VEOA, whereby the MSPB reviews whether a veteran's qualifications were appropriately determined and considered, without intruding into the selection process when the qualifications were considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court has explained that "[a]t the very least, 'credited' must mean 'considered.'" <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, 573 F.3d at 1324. In <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, the agency had refused to consider military experience submitted in a document separate from an application, and the court held that the agency's refusal to look at a relevant document is a statutory violation of &#x00A7; 3311(2)'s guarantee of credit for all material experience. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> ("We can barely imagine a stronger case of violation of a veteran's preference rights."). <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> requires not only a complete record, but consideration of that entire record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> the court rejected the Board's ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to review an allegation of failure to credit experience because it would amount to a review of the non-selection action on its merits. The <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span> court explained that the Board misapplied "sweeping language" that the issue in a VEOA appeal "is not whether a particular personnel action is proper and should be sustained," from <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 396, 401 (2001). The court explained "[t]here is simply no way to analyze whether a veteran's preference rights were violated without examining the grounds upon which the veteran's non-selection was predicated." <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1320; <span class="Italic">see McCandless v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (holding "[t]he MSPB inquiry into whether it has jurisdiction cannot be...divorced from the factual record").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that "examining the grounds upon which the veteran's non-selection was predicated," <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1320, involves more than determining whether something was improperly omitted, overlooked, or excluded from the agency record. In <span class="Italic">Robert E. Miller v. Department of Navy</span>, the Board applied the principles of <span class="Italic">Lazaro,</span> while recognizing that "the VEOA gives the Board no authority to review the merits of the agency's action beyond determining whether the agency violated a law or regulation related to veterans' preference." 2013 WL 9659019, at *5 (MSPB Nov. 27, 2013). The Board reviewed and upheld the AJ's "analysis of the application process that [the veteran] is entitled to receive," including analyzing the application requirements, the veteran's r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;, and the determination by a specialist at the agency that the veteran lacked the specified experience. <span class="Italic">Id</span> at *5 n.2<span class="Italic">;</span> s<span class="Italic">ee also Clarke v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 604, 607 (2003) (ruling that MSPB has jurisdiction of VEOA appeals and sustaining the agency's nonselection because nothing in the appellant's application "indicate[d] that this experience 'cumulated to the equivalent of at least two years of full-time special collections work,' as required by the vacancy announcement.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles, in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184 (2008), the Board found a VEOA violation because "[t]here was no evidence in the record that the agency actually considered whether the appellant's listed experience would satisfy OPM's requirement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 188. As remedy, the MSPB ordered the agency to take corrective action and to reconstruct the selection processes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the MSPB does not reevaluate the weight the agency accorded to a veteran's experience, the MSPB's jurisdiction extends to determining whether the agency actually evaluated "experience material to the position," as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found, based on review of the record, "that the agency dutifully and thoroughly considered [Mr. Miller's] work history," a finding "reinforced by the fact that the agency solicited additional information from the applicant." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. at 97. The record contains declarations, deposition and hearing testimony, and documentation presented at the hearing conducted by the AJ; this information was discussed in the AJ's initial decision, and reviewed by the full Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this appeal, Mr. Miller concedes that he does not meet the minimum requirement of twenty-four semester hours of coursework. He argues that the FDIC should have found him qualified on the basis of his experience, citing OPM's "Policies and Instructions for Interpreting Minimum Education Requirements," which state that "on rare occasions, there may be applicants who may not meet exactly the educational requirements for a particular series, but who may be in fact demonstrably well qualified to perform the work in a series because of exceptional experience or a combination of education and experience." OPM Qualifications, &#x00A7; E.4.g. To be considered qualified under this exception, "the applicant's work experience must reflect significant full performance-level accomplishments directly applicable to the positions to be filled." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the FDIC evaluated all of Mr. Miller's experience, including supplemental materials, and found that it did not provide the "exceptional," "directly applicable" experience required to bring him within the exception. The record shows that substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that the agency "credited" all of Mr. Miller's work history in evaluating the education requirements, thus supporting the Board's finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) was not violated. Although it is clear that Mr. Miller is highly educated and has substantial experience, it is not the role of the court to determine whether he satisfies the requirements for the position on the basis of his experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller also argues that the FDIC violated the Delegated Examining Unit Standard Operating Procedure (DEU SOP) by failing to inform him that he could request formal reconsideration. Under the FDIC's DEU SOP, there is a formal reconsideration process initiated by a request in writing from an applicant. The AJ found that the DEU SOP is not a statute or regulation relating to a veterans' preference, and thus is beyond the jurisdiction of a VEOA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller argues that the AJ erred by limiting witness testimony on the issue of violation of the DEU SOP, because he states that a failure to reconsider experience amounts to a failure to credit experience under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question is whether the FDIC's failure to notify Mr. Miller of this reconsideration process amounted to a violation of a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference, or a failure to credit experience under &#x00A7; 3311(2). Mr. Miller argues that Ms. Senft should have realized that he was dissatisfied with the FDIC's final determination and given him notice of the opportunity for reconsideration. At the hearing, in response to a question by the AJ, Ms. Senft stated that the DEU SOP does not require the agency to notify an applicant of the reconsideration process absent a request for additional review or reconsideration by the applicant. Mr. Miller does not argue that he made such a request. On overview of the entirety of the procedures that occurred, we conclude that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in limiting testimony on the FDIC's reconsideration procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Miller also criticizes the AJ's procedural and discovery decisions. As stated in <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988), "[p]rocedural matters relative to discovery and evidentiary issues fall within the sound discretion of the board and its officials." Mr. Miller has not established that any of the AJ's discovery or evidentiary rulings caused harm or prejudice that reasonably could have affected the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1379 ("[I]n order for petitioner to prevail on these issues he must prove that the error caused substantial harm or prejudice to his rights which could have affected the outcome of the case.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the MSPB erred in insisting that it has no authority or responsibility beyond determining whether the record before the agency was complete. Precedent requires that the Board determine whether the record was adequately considered by the agency. However, in this case the Board did determine that the agency adequately considered the record, including witness testimony at the hearing conducted by the AJ and analysis by the AJ and the full Board. We discern no reversible error in the Board's ruling that a VEOA violation was not shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to reevaluate the agency's assessment of the appellant's qualifications for a position in <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS,</span> DC-3330-11-0405-M-1 (NP 5/8/2015), concluding that the appellant did not demonstrate that the "agency improperly omitted or failed to consider any of his qualifying education or experience":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his reply to the agency's response to the August 2, 2013 order, the appellant primarily argued that the agency erred in finding him not minimally qualified for the Social Science Analyst position and provided his own assessment of his qualifications to rebut those provided by the agency. In support of his argument, he attached several documents that he contends show that he met the minimum educational and specialized experience requirements for the position. (the appellant's evaluation of his education), (the appellant's evaluation of his specialized experience).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_683"></span>The appellant's own assessment of his qualifications, however, is not dispositive. As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 12 (2014), VEOA does not empower the Board to reevaluate the merits of an agency's ultimate determination that a preference-eligible veteran is not qualified for a position with the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Where it is evident that the agency considered an appellant's relevant education, experience, and other qualifications, the Board will not engage in a fact-based review of how an agency weighed and assessed a preference-eligible veteran's qualifications for a position of employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Rather, the Board's role is limited to determining whether the hiring agency improperly omitted, overlooked, or excluded a portion of the appellant's experiences or work history in assessing his qualifications for the vacancy, and the Board will not reevaluate the weight the agency accorded those experiences in reaching its decision that the appellant was not qualified for a given position of employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency submitted an affidavit from the Human Resources Specialist who reviewed the appellant's application package in both the original and the reconstructed selection process. Applying OPM's Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, she determined that the appellant did not meet the basic education or specialized experience requirements for the position in the 0101 Social Sciences series based on a thorough review of the contents of his application package. Although the appellant disagrees with the agency's analysis of his education and specialized experience qualifications, he has provided no basis for us to disturb the agency's finding that he was not minimally qualified for the position. Specifically, we find that the record reflects that the agency considered the appellant's relevant education, experience, and other credentials in assessing his overall qualifications for the position and that he has not shown that the agency improperly omitted or failed to consider any of his qualifying education or experience.[4] The Board, therefore, is not in a position to reexamine the merits of the agency's ultimate finding that he was not minimally qualified for the position, as the appellant requests. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although the appellant alleges that the agency failed to review his entire application package, the record evidence demonstrates that the agency reviewed the entirety of his application package, including those pages that were inadvertently left out of its filings in the remand compliance appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, under <span class="Italic">Kerner v. Dept. of Interior,</span> CH-4324-11-0568-C-1 (NP 5/28/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While a preference eligible is entitled to have a broad range of experiences considered by the agency in reviewing his application for a position, how the agency adjudges and weighs those experiences is beyond the purview of the Board in a VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 9 (2014). The Board's role is limited to assessing whether an agency considered all of an appellant's valuable experience, which is material to the position for which he has applied, and this assessment does not include a review of the weight the agency gave to the appellant's prior experiences in determining that he was not qualified for a position. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12. Here, the agency submitted an affidavit by the Human Resources Specialist who reviewed the applications. She declared that she considered all of the appellant's work experience, including the years he spent from 2003 to 2010 as a Protective Security Specialist while apparently on contract to the Department of State and Department of Defense. We find, therefore, that the agency properly considered the appellant's experience.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Third, it is undisputed that the agency scored the appellant's applications for the two vacancy announcements, even though he was only eligible for one, each time resulting in a "Category B" rating, and not the higher rated "Category A." Generally speaking, this method of sorting applicants is not a violation of any veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See generally Launer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review of the 0357 Appeal, the appellant asserts that the agency "showed favoritism towards a black applicant from [A]frica." He also disputes the quality of that applicant's education, arguing that it should have been disqualifying.

Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 396, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2001).

Subsequently, he filed a VEOA complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL) regarding the agency's alleged denial of his right to compete for the vacancy, and DOL closed its investigation into his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal seeking corrective action under VEOA, alleging that the agency denied him the right to compete for the Supervisory Logistics Management position. Without holding a hearing, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. She found that the Board has jurisdiction over the VEOA appeal, but that the agency did not deny the appellant a right to compete for the vacancy, which was announced under the merit promotion process, in failing to refer him to the selecting official. The administrative judge determined that the agency afforded the appellant an opportunity to compete for the vacancy in considering his application and that, even if the appellant had been entitled to veterans' preference, "it would have made no difference" because the agency cancelled the vacancy announcement and no selection was made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant implicitly alleges that the administrative judge mischaracterized his arguments regarding the agency's denial of his right to compete for the vacancy. He clarifies that he is alleging that the agency denied him the right to compete for the Supervisory Logistics Management position in failing to properly consider his application and qualifications--not that the agency denied him the right to compete simply by not referring him to the selecting official, as the administrative judge construed his claim. More specifically, the appellant alleges that the agency "recklessly disregarded" his military experience as an acquisitions/logistic officer and his certification under the Defense Acquisitions Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Under DAWIA, the Department of Defense was required to establish a process through which persons in the acquisition workforce would be recognized as having achieved professional status. <span class="Italic">See</span> <a href="https://www.dau.mil/doddacm/Pages/Certification.aspx">www.dau.mil/doddacm/Pages/Certification.aspx</a>. Certification is the procedure through which a military service or Department of Defense component determines that an employee meets the education, training and experience standards required for a career level in any acquisition, technology, and logistics career field. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_684"></span>We agree with the appellant that the administrative judge mischaracterized the underlying basis of his VEOA appeal. The record reflects that the appellant alleged that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights under 5 U.S.C. 3304(f)(1) in failing to credit his military experience when it considered his application, which thereby denied him the opportunity to compete for the vacancy. In support of his argument, he cited statutes and regulations regarding crediting military experience and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army,</span> 573 F.3d 1318, 1324-25 (Fed. Cir. 2009), for the proposition that the agency must credit a veteran's military experience in considering his/her application for employment. Based on the foregoing, we find that the administrative judge mischaracterized the underlying basis of the appellant's VEOA appeal and, thus, we GRANT the appellant's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously examined whether an agency violated an appellant's veterans' preference rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) in denying him the opportunity to compete for a vacancy announced under the merit promotion process by failing to properly consider his application. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of the Navy,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 12 (2008). In <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> the Board remanded the appeal to the regional office to determine whether the agency properly considered the appellant's qualifications for a GS-8 position. <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14. In so doing, we tacitly recognized that an agency's consideration of an individual's qualifications, including prior work experience, as set forth in the application materials, is part of affording an individual the opportunity to compete for a vacancy. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 10. Our reviewing court recently reaffirmed the Board's authority to review the grounds upon which a veteran was not selected to determine whether his preference rights were violated. <span class="Italic">See Lazaro v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 666 F.3d 1316, 1320-21 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, a question exists regarding whether the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) in denying him the right to compete by failing to properly consider his military experience or any other experience set forth in his application that is material to the Supervisory Logistics Management position for which he applied. However, the record is not sufficiently developed to allow us to make such a determination on review. Thus, we must remand the appeal to the regional office for adjudication of this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, a question exists regarding the remedies available to the appellant if he proves that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights. The agency alleged that it cancelled the vacancy announcement and did not select anyone to fill the position. However, it failed to submit any evidence to support this bare assertion. Thus, we direct the administrative judge to develop the record with regard to this issue and to determine, what, if any, remedy is appropriate in the event that she finds that the agency violated the appellant's right to compete under VEOA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once a veteran is permitted to compete, the agency may still disqualify him from further consideration as a result of his past work history with that agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smyth v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 219, 222 &#x00B6; 7 (2001). Affirming the Board, <span class="Italic">Smyth v. USPS</span>, 41 Fed. Appx. 475, 477 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP) declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The VEOA does not guarantee employment to preference eligibles. Rather, that statute provides only that veterans may not be denied the opportunity to compete for positions within the federal government, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) (2000), and establishes certain preferences to be afforded veterans during the interviewing process in furtherance of that mandate, including the entitlement to have a certain number of extra points added to a veteran's passing score on an agency entrance examination, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 (2000). In the present case, Smyth has not demonstrated that the agency failed to afford him any rights he was entitled to under the VEOA. Indeed, the evidence indicates that Smyth received the five additional points he was entitled to under &#x00A7; 3309, and that the agency granted him an interview for the Rural Carrier Associate position. It was only after Smyth's disciplinary records associated with his prior employment at the agency were discovered that Smyth was disqualified from consideration. We therefore conclude that the Board did not err in determining that the agency did not violate Smyth's rights under the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harellson v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 534, 538-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, 2010 MSPB 76 (2010) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Harellson v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HARELLSON_PATRICK_K_SF_4324_09_0406_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_564845.pdf">115 MSPR 378</a>, 379-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-21, 2011 MSPB 3 (2011) (involving application of a disparate impact theory of discrimination in a USERRA case)), noted that while VEOA may require that the selection process not exclude the appellant, the process does not bar consideration and nonselection based upon factors relating to the appellant's background or work history:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument is that he was denied the right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) for the Custodian positions the agency filled in Honolulu because, after the agency demonstrated, by initially considering him for these positions, that they were open to candidates from outside its workforce, it improperly excluded him from further consideration by choosing to hire employees through its internal hiring registers. The appellant argues that excluding him from consideration in this fashion is improper under <span class="Italic">Boctor</span> and <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 671 (2006), appeals that arose under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes evidence that could be regarded as supporting the appellant's claim that he was considered for the Custodian positions at issue here. In a sworn declaration submitted in connection with the appellant's EEO complaint, Kurt Daniels, Maintenance Engineering Specialist, who was involved in the selection process for the positions in question, stated that Lawrence Kami, Manager, Maintenance Operations, asked him to review the appellant's file to determine his qualifications for a Custodian position, and that, upon doing so, he noted problems with the appellant's past performance. Mr. Kami did not deny having asked Mr. Daniels to review the appellant's file, stating only that he determined to fill the positions internally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the evidence described above is sufficient to establish that the agency accepted the application of the appellant, an outside candidate, then it would also establish that the appellant, as a preference eligible, was entitled to compete for the Honolulu Custodian positions. <span class="Italic">See Boctor,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 7. We need not determine, however, whether the evidence is sufficient for these purposes. Even if it is, the appellant would be entitled only to compete for the positions in question, that is, to be considered for them. <span class="Italic">See id.; Brandt,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. The same evidence that suggests that the agency considered the appellant's application also indicates that, to the extent that it did so, it permitted the appellant to compete for the Custodian positions. The right to compete under &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) does not preclude an agency from eliminating a veteran or a preference eligible from further consideration for a position based on his qualifications for the position. <span class="Italic">Cf. Montee v. Department of the Army,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 271, &#x00B6; 9 (2008) (section 3304 does not exempt veterans or preference eligibles from the qualification requirements of the positions for which they may apply). Moreover, nothing in <span class="Italic">Boctor, Brandt,</span> or any other authority requires that the veteran or preference eligible be considered at every stage of the selection process, up to that process's final stage. Instead, those authorities, and section 3304(f)(1) itself, require only that the individual be permitted to compete on the same basis as other candidates. The consideration the appellant alleges he received accordingly would be sufficient to satisfy any obligation the agency may have had to permit the appellant to compete for the Custodian positions. Therefore, we find that the agency did not violate the appellant's rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) when it considered and selected two internal employees to fill those positions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although VEOA provides preference eligibles or veterans the right to compete, it does not provide that the applicant will be considered eligible for positions beyond his qualifications. <span class="Italic">Small v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 Fed. Appx. 406, 407-08 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cossette v. USDA</span>, 113 Fed. Appx. 399, 401 (Fed.

DOD</span>, DC-3330-18-0427-I-1 (NP 8/26/2022) ("Because the appellant rated himself not minimally qualified in his assessment, he was not entitled to be considered for the next phases of the selection process, such as being placed in a category in accordance with his veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Harellson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 534, 539 (2010) (observing that no authority requires that a preference eligible be considered at every stage of the selection process); <span class="Italic">Dale v.
