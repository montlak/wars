<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-57"><span class="space">d.</span> Retirement Appeals</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has found that the strict application of the adversarial model of adjudication is not always appropriate in a case involving retirement benefits." <span class="Italic">Searcy v. OPM</span>, 98 MSPR 598, 601 &#x00B6; 8 (2005). Retirement appeals involving vested benefits posed special problems concerning timeliness, as suggested by Chairman Erdreich's dissent in <span class="Italic">Jiminez v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 466, 467-69 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In my dissent in <span class="Italic">Munir v. OPM</span>, 63 MSPR 287 (1994), I questioned our standard for finding good cause to waive the Board's time limits for filing an appeal in a case involving a claim for retirement benefits, and urged that we apply a different standard for waiver in that type of appeal. In the present case, Se&#x00F1;ora Jimenez had until September in the year 2008 to initiate her claim for retirement benefits. She should not be denied the right to argue for those benefits simply because she was three or four months late filing her appeal with the Board in 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Se&#x00F1;ora Jimenez's delay in filing should be excused under existing Board precedent because the nature of a retirement appeal is substantively different from the nature of an adverse action appeal. Board regulations require that an untimely petition for appeal not be dismissed if a good reason for the delay is shown. In <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Air Force</span>, 4 MSPR 180 (1980), the Board held that an untimely appellant only need give a "reasonable excuse" for the delay "in light of the particular facts and attendant circumstances where diligence or ordinary prudence has been exercised."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In articulating the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> standard, the Board discussed the need to balance the right of the appellant to a decision on the merits against the need of the agency for finality in personnel actions. As part of that discussion, the Board noted the observations of the Senate that the changes in the appeals procedures incorporated into the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 were intended to protect the right of employees while simultaneously giving agencies greater ability to remove or discipline expediently. It was this intent of Congress that the Board incorporated into the concept of the need for a "finality of personnel actions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When assessing whether an appellant has given "a good reason" for an untimely filing in a retirement case, however, the competing interest of the agency's need for personnel action finality is not a part of the assessment. In a discipline or removal case, it can be said that an expedient response to an appeal enables the agency to move forward with the management of its programs and its work force. However, in an appeal related to a retirement decision made by OPM, there is no such agency need for finality to compete with the right of the appellant to a decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a disciplinary appeal, the appellant is responding to a decision made by an agency in the course of managing its work force. In a retirement appeal, however, the appellant is the moving party and is requesting an earned benefit guaranteed by law. The competing concerns of agency management and employee rights that require a somewhat strict application of time limits in discipline appeals do not exist in retirement appeals. There are no competing interests to be balanced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The whole purpose of the retirement application and appeal process is to determine whether the applicant is entitled to a retirement benefit. If he is, then OPM is obligated to provide the benefit. If he is not, then OPM is obligated to deny the benefit. Unlike the balanced interests involved in a disciplinary appeal, there is only one primary interest involved in a retirement appeal, that of the applicant's entitlement under law to a benefit. Therefore, any doubt as to whether the appellant has shown good cause for waiving the time limits in a retirement appeal should be resolved in favor of the appellant, even more so than in a disciplinary appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Se&#x00F1;ora Jimenez has attested that the mail directed to her home in Costa Rica was delayed many weeks. In addition, she has detailed the difficulty that she had obtaining Spanish-from-English translations of documents she received from the Office of Personnel Management and the Board. And finally, she has explained the difficulty she had obtaining legal representation in Costa Rica who would be comfortable with dealing in English with agencies of the United States government. In consideration of the unique nature of a retirement benefits claim, these are good reasons to excuse her late filing. I would waive the time limits and remand this case for a hearing on the merits. The appellant's unintended delay should not be grounds to deny Se&#x00F1;ora Jimenez's claim to a life-time benefit based on a life-time of government service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Munir v. OPM</span>, 63 MSPR 287, 288 (1994) (Chairman Erdreich dissenting in a retirement case involving death benefits: "the applicant has a regulatory period of <span class="Italic">30 years</span> from the death of the employee in which to file a claim").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit allied itself with the Chairman's views as it remanded the lump sum benefits retirement appeal in the (unfortunately) nonprecedential decision in <span class="Italic">Davis v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3196):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_943"></span>Davis filed an appeal from the May 10, 1995 reconsideration decision by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which affirmed OPM's denial of Davis' application for lump-sum death benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Davis' appeal was postmarked June 30, 1995. An appeal from an OPM reconsideration decision must be filed with the Board within thirty-five days. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) (1996). Davis' appeal was sixteen days late. Consequently, the Board ordered Davis to submit evidence to show that good cause existed for his untimely filing. Davis failed to respond to the show cause order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Davis, however, had attached a letter to his appeal explaining that his attorney did not receive his new address correctly and that this delayed his receipt of the OPM reconsideration decision. The administrative judge (AJ) found that Davis failed to state when he did receive the OPM reconsideration decision. The AJ noted that Davis is bound by the actions and inaction of his chosen counsel. The AJ concluded that there was no basis for Davis' untimely filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board denied Davis' petition for review of the initial decision. Chairman Erdreich dissented on the grounds that the circumstances of the case warranted excusing the late filing. The Chairman believed that the fact that the underlying action was a claim for lump-sum death benefits for which Davis had thirty years in which to file his claim warranted waiving the timeliness requirements in this case. The Chairman stated that Davis exercised due diligence in filing his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the Board's decision, we must affirm unless it is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">Rowe v. MSPB</span>, 802 F.2d 434, 437 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Davis bears the burden of proof with respect to the timeliness issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)] . Absent a showing of good cause, the Board will not waive its timeliness requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are concerned, however, at the paucity of the findings by the administrative judge regarding Davis' late filing. Along with his appeal to the Board, Davis attached a letter explaining that his late filing was due to his attorney not having his correct new address which resulted in his delayed receipt of the OPM decision. This attachment was sufficient to put the AJ on notice that Davis had an excuse for his late filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chairman Erdreich's dissent notes that Davis' untimely filing should be excused because OPM failed to send a copy of its decision directly to Davis, that Davis' attorney abruptly withdrew from representation late in the time period for filing an appeal, and that Davis took prompt action in filing an appeal without legal assistance within eight days of his receipt of the OPM decision. These facts, if a part of the record, should have been considered by the AJ. Moreover, the AJ's opinion indicates that the exact time Davis actually received the OPM decision was a critical factor in his decision, yet the AJ, knowing that the OPM decision was received late, did not pursue this timing question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Davis in fact took prompt action to file his appeal within eight days of receipt of OPM's decision this would indicate that he acted with due diligence and, in light of all of the circumstances, could constitute good cause which would warrant waiving the timeliness requirement. The AJ should consider carefully all pertinent facts, along with the brevity of the delay and the gravity of the penalty which Davis will face for his lateness. For example, if Davis' lateness is not waived he will be barred from appealing the denial of lump-sum death benefits for which he would have had thirty years to initiate his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we vacate the Board's decision and remand the case for the AJ to make findings, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, as to when Davis received the OPM decision from counsel and his diligence in filing thereafter and to consider whether any such additional facts, together with those set forth in Davis' letter accompanying the appeal, are sufficient to establish good cause for his untimely filing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit remanded a disability retirement appeal, <span class="Italic">Jones v. MSPB</span>, 256 Fed. Appx. 353, 356 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case fit the criteria for a finding of good cause to waive the time limit for filing. Under the circumstances of this case, Jones exercised ordinary prudence in the selection and supervision of his attorney and the pursuance of his appeal. The one-month delay in the filing of Jones's appeal was more than minimal, but certainly far short of egregious, especially in light of the fact that the agency has failed to argue any prejudice it would suffer if Jones were granted a waiver of the time limit. No negligence appears to have been involved here, except perhaps that of his lawyer, a matter about which we express no opinion. Furthermore, the seriousness and timing of Jones's mother's terminal illness as well as the need for him to continue treatment for his own serious medical problems are certainly circumstances beyond his control that undoubtedly affected his ability to supervise his attorney's compliance with the filing deadline. And it was reasonable for Jones to rely upon the assurances of his attorney one week prior to the deadline that the matter was being pursued and that his appeal would be filed on time. Jones also acted expeditiously to file his appeal upon learning that it had not been filed by his attorney, despite his recent surgery. Thus, while the Board has discretion in determining whether there is good cause for delay, the principles of justice and good conscience dictate that the failure to find good cause for the delay under the circumstances of this case was clearly unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Remanding a case for further development of evidence concerning the timeliness of the appeal, the Board made reference in <span class="Italic">Somerville v. OPM</span>, 98 MSPR 341, 344 &#x00B6; 8 (2005), to "the emphasis we place upon resolving retirement cases on the merits." If a retirement appeal is untimely, the appellant is not barred from filing another disability application for changed conditions following the prior reconsideration decision, assuming the annuity application is otherwise timely. <span class="Italic">See Hoskins v. OPM</span>, CH-844E-13-0144-I-1 n.5 (NP 1/23/2014) ("This decision should not be construed as barring the appellant from filing a subsequent disability retirement application with OPM if she believes her medical conditions were disabling after the May 10, 2012 reconsideration date and she is within the time limit for filing a new application. <span class="Italic">See Luzi v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6; 9 (2007) (<span class="Italic">res judicata</span> did not bar the appellant's second disability retirement application based on a different time period than was addressed in the original application and related Board appeal); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span> AT-0831-15-0226-I-1 (NP 9/28/2015) ("Although the appellant filed the appeal outside of the 30-day time limit for appealing reconsideration decisions to the Board, OPM did not challenge the timeliness of the appellant's Board appeal or his contention that he did not receive a copy of the reconsideration decision until December 2014. The administrative judge did not make a specific finding as to the timeliness of the appellant's Board appeal. As the agency has not challenged the timeliness of the appeal either below or on review, and this matter can be decided on the merits, we discern no need to address the timeliness issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ferrin-Rodgers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 140, &#x00B6; 7 (2010).").</p>
