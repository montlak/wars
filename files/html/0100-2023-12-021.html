<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-22"><span class="space">2.</span> Factors Considered; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Hillen</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Guidance on how to make and, significantly, how to explain credibility findings was provided in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HILLEN_PHILLIP_G_DC075285103241_OPINION_AND_ORDER_218101.pdf">35 MSPR 453</a>, 458-62 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To resolve credibility issues, an administrative judge must first identify the factual questions in dispute; second, summarize all of the evidence on each disputed question of fact; third, state which version he or she believes; and, fourth, explain in detail why the chosen version was more credible than the other version or versions of the event. Numerous factors, which will be considered in more detail below, must be considered in making and explaining a credibility determination. These include: (1) The witness's opportunity and capacity to observe the event or act in question; (2) the witness's character; (3) any prior inconsistent statement by the witness; (4) a witness's bias, or lack of bias; (5) the contradiction of the witness's version of events by other evidence or its consistency with other evidence; (6) the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events; and (7) the witness's demeanor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Opportunity and Capacity to Observe the Event or Act</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Personal knowledge of the event or act at issue is an essential qualification of a witness, and the requisite personal knowledge is established by evaluation of the witness's opportunity, as to place, time, proximity, and similar factors, to observe the event or act in issue.... These factors relating to a witness's opportunity to observe are material in determining the witness's credibility.... The witness's capacity to observe refers to his or her ability to understand what was seen and intelligently narrate it....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Character.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Character evidence may be used for impeachment of a witness on the theory that certain characteristics render that person more prone to testify untruthfully.... This form of impeaching evidence may be established by prior misconduct or reputation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prior Inconsistent Statement</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The effect of a prior inconsistent statement is not that the present testimony is false but that the very fact of the inconsistency raises doubt as to the truthfulness of both statements.... The form of the inconsistency, whether oral, in writing, or by conduct, is immaterial and the statements or conduct need not be in direct conflict....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Bias</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The possibility of bias is always significant in assessing a witness's credibility. Bias rests on the assumptions that certain relationships and <span id="Page_1618"></span>circumstances impair the impartiality of a witness and that a witness who is not impartial may consciously or unconsciously shade his or her testimony for or against one of the other witnesses or parties.... The trier of fact must be sufficiently informed of the underlying relationships, circumstances, and influences operating on the witness, so that in the light of his or her experience, he or she can determine whether a mutation in the testimony could reasonably be expected as a probable human reaction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One aspect of bias is the question of self-serving testimony. Although the fact that a witness's testimony may be self-serving does not by itself provide sufficient grounds for disbelieving that testimony, it is a factor for consideration in assessing the probative weight of the evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contradiction by or Consistency with Other Evidence</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contradiction is the calling of one or more witnesses who deny the fact or facts asserted by another witness and maintain that the opposite is the truth; the contradiction in itself does nothing probatively unless the contradicting witness or witnesses is believed in preference to the first witness.... Contradiction rests on the inference that if a witness is mistaken about one fact, he or she may be mistaken about more facts and therefore his or her testimony is untrustworthy....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the related topic of polygraph evidence, the Board has previously stated that the admissibility of polygraph results is a matter within the authority of the administrative judge.... In finding polygraph results admissible, the Board does not imply that the results of such a test must be accepted into evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Inherent Improbability</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Inherent improbability relies on the trier of fact's evaluation of the likelihood of the event occurring in the manner described in the testimony....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Demeanor</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not sustain Specification 9, which he characterized as being "essentially a 'he said/she said' specification." Although the Board has previously used this terminology in its case law, e.g., <span class="Italic">Faucher v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 203, &#x00B6; 7 (2004); <span class="Italic">Vicente v. Department of the Army</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6; 7 (2000), we observe that sexual misconduct cases involve no special credibility assessment, and such cases are no different than any other case involving conflicting testimony. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987). We see no reason to label such matters as "he said, she said," as that may suggest that a different standard applies in the assessment of credibility. Nevertheless, the terminology that the administrative judge used to describe this specification is immaterial to the analysis and does not affect the outcome of the decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requirements of <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> fully apply to performance cases decided on substantial rather than preponderant evidence under Title 43. <span class="Italic">Gruner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 333, 338 (1989) ("[A]lthough the administrative judge summarized the testimony presented and stated conclusions, she did not explain why she credited the testimony presented by the agency over that presented by the appellant in reaching her conclusions."). The Board continues to insist that AJs scrutinize all evidence in the record--and provide written analysis reflecting that scrutiny--when they determine significant disputed issues of credibility, particularly when hearsay evidence is disputed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 593, 600 (1988) (on critical credibility issues the AJ failed to summarize the evidence and discuss conflicting testimony); <span class="Italic">Mallory v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Furlough v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 122, 124-25 (1988), rejected broad credibility findings supported by references to only some material evidence in the appeal record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987), the Board held that, to resolve credibility issues, an administrative judge must identify the factual questions in dispute, summarize all of the evidence on each disputed factual question, state which version he or she believes, and explain in detail why the chosen version is more credible than the other version or versions of the event. The Board also enumerated seven factors that must be considered in making and explaining a credibility determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge has failed to meet these requirements under the circumstances of this case. In finding for the agency, the administrative judge stated simply that: "Having observed the demeanor of the appellant and the agency witness at the hearing, I find the appellant's testimony is less than credible. I find the testimony of the agency witnesses...was clear and convincing and was spontaneous with quick and clear responses." The administrative judge then explained that some of the agency's witnesses's testimonies were both consistent with various documentary evidence and other evidence presented at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence presented in the instant case, however, requires more. In his petition for review, the appellant has identified numerous instances where the agency witnesses could not recall certain matters, or offered testimony that was internally inconsistent or inconsistent with other testimony. The appellant has also identified testimony supporting his assertions that some of the agency's witnesses were biased against him, and that other testimony was inherently implausible. The administrative judge, however, failed to mention these matters, or explain how they affected his ultimate conclusion that the testimonies of the agency witnesses were clear and convincing. The administrative judge also failed to explain why the appellant's testimony was "less than credible." We, therefore, conclude that the administrative judge's findings fail to meet the requirements in <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> for resolving credibility issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Credibility findings are based on reasoned consideration of credibility factors involving each witness; they should not be based on the number of allegations against an appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hatch v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 40 MSPR 260, 268 (1989) (sexual harassment charges: the AJ's finding that each of the agency's witnesses told the truth because of the large number of remarks attributed to the appellant was inadequate). Critical analysis is expected when the appellant complains, and provides some evidence showing, that an action against him was motivated by a supervisor's bias. <span class="Italic">Bonds v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 80, 84 (1988).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1619"></span>Wright also argues that the board erred in discrediting his wife's testimony. We agree. In her first initial decision, the administrative judge declined to consider Anita Wright's testimony because of spousal interest. The board reversed, holding that familial interest "cannot, by itself, support a finding that her testimony was not credible." 72 MSPR at 22. On remand, the administrative judge again discredited Anita Wright's testimony because:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Based on the presence of a bruise on Ms. Vasquez's shoulder and Mr. Robinson's testimony that he saw Ms. Vasquez 'up against the wall,' I find that Ms. Vasquez did indeed fall against the wall.... Either Ms. Wright did not see this happen or her testimony is not truthful.... Additionally, Ms. Wright is the appellant's wife and admitted she has a vested interest in seeing the appellant win this appeal. Thus, a potential bias exists because of her direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the appeal, lessening the weight of her testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A familial interest, while relevant, is not sufficient to disregard a witness' testimony. <span class="Italic">See Regennitter v. Commissioner of the Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 166 F.3d 1294, 1298 (9th Cir. 1999) ("We have explained, however, that '[t]he fact that a lay witness is a family member cannot be a ground for rejecting his or her testimony.'")

Nuth</span>, 140 F.3d 572, 581 (4th Cir. 1998) ("We must evaluate the testimony of [the defendant's] own father in light of the potential bias inherent in such testimony."). We take a similar view of a spouse's testimony. <span class="Italic">See generally Seal-Flex, Inc. v. Athletic Track and Court Constr.</span>, 98 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed.

The board, therefore, cannot refuse to consider testimony simply because the witness has a familial interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its 1996 decision, the board correctly reversed the administrative judge's dismissal of Anita Wright's testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> 72 MSPR at 22. After remand, however, the board allowed the administrative judge, purportedly relying on a "pecuniary interest," to again discredit her testimony. This interest is based solely on her marriage to Wright and the board should not have allowed the administrative judge to do indirectly what it expressly forbade her to do directly. Discrediting testimony that supports Wright merely because it comes from his wife, while fully crediting the testimony of Vasquez despite evidence of her lack of credibility, was arbitrary. <span class="Italic">See Grubka v. Department of Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (reversing because the administrative judge "show[ed] undeniable bias" against the petitioner and its credibility determination was "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and unsupported by substantial evidence"). Consequently, we reverse the board's holding that Anita Wright's testimony is not to be credited and remand so that it may be properly considered.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If testimony is in conflict on material points, the AJ must analyze the credibility of each witness and explain why one witness is believed over another.

USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 55, 57-58 (1988). Factors considered by the AJ in assessing credibility are to have some logical connection to a determination of who is telling the truth. That an individual was not offered as a witness before the agency or named in a petition for appeal is not a proper basis to discredit the testimony of that individual. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 65 MSPR 186, 199 (1994), determined that "[t]he point in time at which a witness is first presented for consideration is not, by itself, an appropriate basis by which to determine credibility."

<p class="Body-Text">An example of the Board's review of credibility findings by an AJ is provided by <span class="Italic">Dangerfield v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 678, 681-82 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding this charge sustained, the administrative judge relied on documentary evidence, i.e., photographs of the damaged vehicle and a statement from Mae White, another supervisor. In her sworn statement, White stated that she received a telephone call from the appellant at approximately 12:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on July 8, 1996, stating that the appellant indicated that she would be taking sick leave that day. White stated that, in response to her question to the appellant as to whether the appellant had driven the vehicle "on Saturday," the appellant answered "yes," and asked "why." White stated that, when she informed the appellant that the vehicle had been involved in an accident, the appellant stated that she had "hit something" but that she did not examine the vehicle and did not believe that the impact was that great. According to White, when she told the appellant that the vehicle was badly damaged, the appellant responded, "Oh really?" White then stated that she informed the appellant that reporting of the accident was required. The administrative judge found that White's statement and testimony were "reasonable, credible, and consistent," that she "testified without hesitation," gave no indication that she was prone "to exaggerate or otherwise compromise her testimony," and that her "[h]er demeanor and responsiveness to questions were beyond reproach[.]"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also considered the appellant's testimony that she attempted to report the accident later on Sunday morning, July 7, but that her supervisor's voice mail was full, that she was unaware that the vehicle was damaged and that, at the time of the accident, she was too tired, even to leave a note. The administrative judge found that it was "incomprehensible" that the appellant would have been unable to report the accident if she had made an effort to do so, noting that the appellant did not mention her efforts to report the accident in her telephone conversation with White and that her assertions that she attempted to report the accident were inconsistent with her comments to White. The administrative judge found that the appellant's testimony and arguments were "lacking in candor," that "her demeanor was less than convincing," and, thus, that her testimony and arguments were not credible. Therefore, the administrative judge found that the agency proved this charge by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's explained finding that the agency proved this charge by preponderant evidence. The administrative judge fully addressed the credibility of the witnesses, applying the relevant factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span> 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987), including the demeanor of the witnesses. The administrative judge's credibility determinations are entitled to due deference. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Department of the Navy,</span> 2 MSPB 297, 2 MSPR 129, 133 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied,</span> 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (special deference must be given to the administrative judge's findings regarding credibility where those findings are based on the demeanor of witnesses)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oliveros-Ballon v. USPS,</span> SF-0752-15-0615-I-1 (NP 4/15/2016), closely reviewed a credibility analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the administrative judge failed to consider his background as a "former Marine" and a "family man" and his "good employment record" in determining the credibility of his testimony. However, an administrative judge is not required to consider these factors when making a credibility determination. <span class="Italic">See Hillen</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 458 (setting forth the factors that an administrative judge must consider in making a credibility determination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant argues that the administrative judge failed to consider evidence that undermines the credibility of the complainants' testimony. First, he disputes the administrative judge's finding that there was no evidence that the complainants were friends, worked closely together, or discussed their allegations with each other. The appellant claims that the administrative judge overlooked evidence that the complainants had the same work shift and worked at the same facility. Because the administrative judge's finding that the complainants were credible is consistent with the record, we find that the appellant's mere conjecture that the complainants might have communicated together before they testified does not provide a sufficiently sound reason to disturb the administrative judge's credibility determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge violated Rule 608 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in failing to consider character evidence that reflected the complainants' untruthfulness. Rule 608(b) permits extrinsic impeachment evidence of bad acts not involving criminal convictions when the bad acts involved dishonesty. <span class="Italic">Wright v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 10 (1999). The Board also requires <span id="Page_1620"></span>that an administrative judge consider character evidence when making credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 458-59. Here, however, the appellant did not present any character evidence. Although two complainants testified regarding their attendance issues that resulted in formal and informal discipline, and one complainant testified about her emotional outburst against the appellant that resulted in a letter of warning, none of their testimony indicated that their acts involved dishonesty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant contends that the agency should have provided corroborating evidence beyond the complainants' testimony because the agency has the burden of proving the charge. He cites to <span class="Italic">Municipal Bond Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 341 F.2d 683, 691 (8th Cir. 1965), for the proposition that "prejudicial error in receiving incompetent evidence will not be found unless it is affirmatively shown that such evidence induced the court to make a finding which would not otherwise have been made." (Citing also <span class="Italic">Joseph A. Bass Co. v. United States</span>, 340 F.2d 842, 845 (8th Cir. 1965) (finding that, in nonjury cases, the appellate court only will reverse on the basis of the admission of incompetent evidence if the admission of such evidence affected the outcome)). The appellant alleges that the case was "essentially decided on the incompetent evidence of complainant's [sic] testimony." He argues that the complainants' testimony was incompetent because it was not corroborated by other evidence. The appellant, however, does not support his arguments that a lack of corroborating evidence renders the complainants' testimony inadmissible or incompetent, or that the administrative judge cannot sustain the agency's specifications based on the hearing testimony. Further, the agency corroborated the complainants' testimony by calling two witnesses who learned of the appellant's conduct from the complainants.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the disposition of a charge depends on a legal point, the Board will not reverse and remand an AJ's decision for lack of credibility findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 606, 610 (1989) (lack of credibility findings was not reversible error because "an agency is not required to accommodate an employee's transportation problems"). Nor will the Board reverse if an AJ improperly credits evidence as supporting a factual finding as long as the finding is adequately supported by other evidence, e.g., an unsworn statement--a type of harmful error analysis. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 643, 647 (1989).</p>
