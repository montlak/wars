<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-318"><span class="space">p.</span> Change in Employment Status; Reemployment; Benefits Following Restoration to Duty</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulations at 5 CFR 353.101-.210 (2022) generally describe the reemployment rights of federal employees following military service. 5 CFR 353.211 (2022) restates the right of an employee to appeal to the Board if the individual believes that his or her reemployment rights have been violated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">USERRA precludes an agency from changing an employee's status, including work assignments or benefits, as a result of military service unless the employer can meet specified statutory conditions. <span class="Italic">Groom v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 221, 223-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (1999), remanded to an AJ a case asserting that, upon appellant's return from reserve duty, his duties were changed and he was denied pay for performance of reserve duty that would ordinarily have been scheduled during off-duty hours:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under what was originally the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, as "replace[d]" by USERRA, <span class="Italic">see</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2449, 2452, where, as here, an employee whose period of uniformed service was for more than 90 days is found to be entitled to reemployment under 38 USC &#x00A7; 4312, he must be promptly reemployed in the position in which he would have been employed if his continuous employment with the agency had not been interrupted by such service, or a position of like seniority, status, and pay, the duties of which he is qualified to perform. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2).[1] Further, where, as here, the employee's position is abolished during his absence for uniformed service, the agency must reassign the employee to another position of "like status, and pay." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.209(a). "Status" is defined as "the particular attributes of a specific position...includ[ing] the rank or responsibility of the position, its duties, working conditions, pay, tenure, and seniority." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">see also Heidel v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 MSPR 511, 516 (1996) (interpreting the term "status" under USERRA in similar fashion). Thus, under USERRA, the agency in this case must provide the appellant with the appropriate amount of back pay and benefits, as well as an assignment to a position of like status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The agency does not dispute that the appellant is entitled to reemployment under 38 USC &#x00A7; 4312, nor does it argue that it is excused from its reemployment obligation under 38 USC &#x00A7; 4312(d)(1)(A), the subsection that states that an employer is not required to reemploy an employee when "the employees circumstances have so changed as to make such reemployment impossible or unreasonable." Thus, as the appellant correctly argues, the AJ erred in applying 38 USC &#x00A7; 4312(d)(1)(A) to the facts in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ found that, since the appellant's former position had been abolished, the agency had satisfied its obligation to restore the appellant to a position of like status and pay by reemploying him at the same grade and pay in the same commuting area as his former position and enrolling him in the agency's priority placement program in order to locate a position within the agency more suitable to his qualifications and abilities. The AJ further found that the appellant was not entitled to any back pay for the period he served on Reserve Duty, i.e., the period he performed AFTPs, because he was not ready, willing, and able to work during that period. The appellant contends, however, as he did below, that his detail to a set of duties does not constitute restoration to a position of like status, and that he is entitled to back pay for the period he performed AFTPs because he normally schedules such training for off-duty hours. Below and on review, the agency responded in opposition to those allegations with arguments in the form of the agency representative's unsworn statements, but not with any evidence showing its efforts to reassign the appellant to a vacant position, the nature of the appellant's current duties and responsibilities on detail, the agency's rules, regulations, and customary practice regarding the scheduling of AFTPs, or the appellant's past practice of scheduling AFTPs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find under these circumstances that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency has not met its reemployment obligation to him under USERRA.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Definition of "Like Status"</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has an obligation to reemploy the appellant in the same position he would have occupied had his continuous employment not been interrupted by uniformed service, or in a position of like seniority, status, and pay. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A). Here, the agency abolished the appellant's position while he was providing uniformed service and, therefore, the option of returning the appellant to the position he would have held is not available. Thus, the agency must restore the appellant to a position of like status to his original position. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.209(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Status means the particular attributes of a specific position. This includes the rank or responsibility of the position, its duties, working conditions, pay, tenure, and seniority." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 (1996). This list of attributes is illustrative rather than exhaustive. <span class="Italic">Cf. In re APA Transport Corp. Consolidated Litigation,</span> 541 F.3d 233, 241 (3d Cir. 2008) (recognizing as a canon of statutory construction that when the word "includes" is followed by a list of examples, that list is generally considered non-exhaustive).<span class="Italic"> See also Heidel v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 511, 516 (1996) (applying same principle to a list of factors analyzing "like status" when that list ends with the word "etc.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant suggests we should confine our analysis to the one job attribute with which he takes issue, namely, his duties. For this proposition, the appellant relies on the Board's statement in <span class="Italic">Heidel</span> that "[i]f the duties and responsibilities of the new position are not comparable to those of the former position, the positions could not be of 'like status.'" <span class="Italic">Id.; Heidel,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 516. However, the <span class="Italic">Heidel</span> passage cannot be read apart from the regulatory definition or from the rest of the <span class="Italic">Heidel</span> decision itself. <span class="Italic">Heidel,</span> issued on February 13, 1996, does not acknowledge OPM's September 1, 1995 issuance of the regulatory definition of status at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102(a), which established a non-exhaustive list of factors to consider. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed. Reg. 45,652 (Sept. 1, 1995). As such, <span class="Italic">Heidel</span> does not provide the most authoritative test for whether a position is of like status. Nonetheless, Heidel does not, as the appellant suggests, establish a checklist of requirements related to like status, but instead endorses a totality of the circumstances test by "evaluating and weighing the pertinent factors." 69 M.S.P.R. at 516. The Board applied this test, weighing craft, grade, duties and responsibilities, but the Board found that the duties and responsibilities of the new position were "dissimilar enough" to the old position to warrant a finding that the positions were not of like status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 518.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Positions Compared</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In comparing two positions, the Board looks beyond the title and grade of the positions involved, and compares the scope of actual duties and responsibilities of the new position with those of the former position. <span class="Italic">See Gorny v. Department of the Interior,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 15 (2011). However, in the absence of any genuine dispute over the validity of the position descriptions, the Board has accepted them as valid.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The parties have provided the Board with copies of the appellant's pre-deployment IT Specialist position, GS-2210-11, Position No. FS96126, and his current IT Specialist position, GS-2210-11, Position No. GS285428. Here, although the appellant contends, albeit without any detail, that he is not actually performing the duties of the position description, he does not contend that the position description falsely describes the position intended for him. To the contrary, he states that he is "waiting" for training in Vicksburg that will enable him to perform all the duties of the position. Thus, we do not find the appellant's concern to raise any genuine dispute over the validity of comparing the two position descriptions. <span class="Italic">See Gorny,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 620.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's original position is described as that of a hardware specialist in the Information Management Office, whose duties involved installing, repairing, evaluating, and configuring computer systems and their devices. He also performed software-related duties in his original position, as evidenced by the appellant's statement that he: (1) installed, repaired, evaluated and configured computer systems, including software systems; (2) maintained an inventory and insured proper registration and receipts for hardware and software; and (3) called vendors for resolution of problems involving hardware and software.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's new position is described as that of a software asset manager who administers, develops, delivers and supports IT systems and services. The appellant's major duties include: (1) inventory management and logging; (2) ensuring license compliance; and (3) identifying, reporting and resolving a variety of IT issues and problems.<span class="Italic"></span> The agency submits that these three duties are similar to duties performed by the appellant in his previous position, but concedes that the old and new duties are different in other respects. Nonetheless, the agency submits, his current duties are of an "equivalent nature" to the duties of his previous position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find it undisputed, and therefore accept as fact, that the appellant's new position is similar or identical to his prior position in regard to pay, tenure, seniority, working conditions, and rank or responsibility. We find these factors weigh toward a finding that the appellant's current position is of like status to his prior position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">Heidel,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 515-16, 518. We must weigh these factors against the sole factor under dispute, duties.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> We will not interpret USERRA to require the appellant's new duties to be identical to the previous duties. As the Board has observed, albeit in nonUSERRA cases, "Since the appellant's former position has been abolished, [the appellant] 's placement in a different position necessarily involves the performance of different duties." <span class="Italic">Gorny,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 18 <span class="Italic">(citing Marion v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 443, 444 (1998) (finding new position had comparable status to previous one)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_564"></span>The agency acknowledges that the new IT Specialist position involves a change in duties from the appellant's original IT Specialist position, but maintains that his new position is still of like status to his original position because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, his duties "are still in the information technology field and are of a similar magnitude" to those of his original position. The appellant, in turn, contends that the new IT Specialist position is not sufficiently similar to the original position. We find no dispute that the appellant's duties remain in the same general information management field in which he previously worked, and no dispute that the appellant's co-workers who were present for the A-76 outsourcing all essentially lost their positions: they either successfully competed for non-information management positions in the newly created ACE-IT, or the agency placed them in non-information management positions elsewhere within the District. The appellant has obtained the former opportunity, in ACE-IT, albeit still as an IT Specialist and without having to compete for his position. We cannot ignore the circumstances of the appellant obtaining a position in the information management field when his co-workers, equally situated to him except for his uniformed status, had no entitlement to such a position. These factors weigh in favor of a finding that the duties are sufficiently similar under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding our earlier discussion of <span class="Italic">Heidel</span> and <span class="Italic">Nichols,</span> the appellant suggests the facts of his case are analogous to those cases, where the employees' duties and responsibilities in their new positions were found to be too dissimilar to those of their old positions to be of like status. Those cases, however, are readily distinguishable. In<span class="Italic"> Heidel</span> and <span class="Italic">Nichols,</span> the individuals suffered a significant loss in responsibility as well as a diminution in duties; here, neither the responsibilities nor the duties have been diminished at all. <span class="Italic">Heidel</span> involved a Mail Handler who previously performed a variety of tasks, had the opportunity to interact with his coworkers and supervisors in making decisions about how to reschedule work, trained new employees, and was exposed to the workplace decision-making process so as to better prepare him to be a supervisor if he chose to apply for such a position. 69 M.S.P.R. at 516-18. Upon Heidel's return from uniformed service, he was put in a position that required him to sit alone all day at the same table performing the same task. The Board found these two positions were not of like status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 518.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Nichols</span> involved a Chief Chaplain who managed a staff of chaplains. 11 F.3d at 163. While Nichols was performing uniformed service, the agency replaced Nichols with a new Chief Chaplain. Upon Nichols' return from service, the agency placed Nichols under the new Chief Chaplain as one of his staff chaplains.<span class="Italic"> Id</span>. at 164. The Federal Circuit found the positions not of like status, reasoning: "It goes without saying that when one starts out as the boss, but is placed in a position subordinate to the replacement boss, and other new bosses, there is incontestably a loss of authority and accordingly a diminished status." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 163-64. The Federal Circuit ordered the agency to restore Nichols to his original position, which was still available because, unlike here, the position had not been abolished. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant's new position is not at a lower level of responsibility or authority than his previous position; to the contrary, he concedes that the only difference between his old and new positions are the duties. Further, the appellant does not rebut the agency's contention that his new level of responsibility is "equivalent or even slightly greater in some areas, e.g., greater contacts with those outside the agency." Under the circumstances of this case, and weighing the factors of rank or responsibility, duties, working conditions, pay, tenure, and seniority, we find that the agency has fulfilled its obligation to place the appellant in a position of like status to his prior position. We therefore find the agency is in compliance with its obligations under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, explaining flexible application of the "like status" requirement, <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Army</span>, 718 F.3d 1361, 1363-69 (Fed. Cir. 2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Crawford began his employment with the Agency in 1986. With credit for military service, the inception date of his federal service is 1979. During this time, he has occupied several positions with the Agency. In April 2006, at the time Mr. Crawford was called to perform uniformed service, he was an Information Technology (IT) Specialist, GS-2210-11, in the Agency's Army Corps of Engineers New York District Information Management Office (Mr. Crawford's "old position"). Mr. Crawford's uniformed service lasted until about April 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June 2006, the Agency transferred many of its information management/information technology (IM/IT) functions to Lockheed Martin. This transfer was authorized by the Office Management and Budget Circular A-76 program. As part of the transfer of IM/IT functions, the Agency abolished Mr. Crawford's old position and transferred those duties to Lockheed Martin employees, who are not federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time the Agency transferred certain IM/IT functions to Lockheed Martin, it also formed a new organization called the Army Corps of Engineers-Information Technology (ACE-IT). The mission of ACE-IT is to provide IM/IT services to all agency offices in the United States. In April 2007, recruitment began for the new positions created within ACE-IT. Some Agency employees affected by the A-76 program were hired by ACE-IT through a competitive selection process. Those employees that were not hired by ACE-IT were transferred, with their consent, to non-IM/IT positions in other offices within the Corps of Engineers' New York District.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Mr. Crawford completed uniformed service, the Agency briefly returned him to an IT Specialist position. But in June 2008, the Agency reassigned him to the position of Program Support Specialist, GS-0301-11. Mr. Crawford challenged this reassignment with the Board. He specifically alleged that the Program Support Specialist position violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.209(a)[1] because it was not of "like status" to his old position as an IT Specialist. As such, the Agency violated the reemployment protections provided to those in uniformed service under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2).[2] The administrative judge ("AJ") agreed that the Program Support Specialist position was not of "like status" to Mr. Crawford's old position and granted his request for corrective action. As part of that corrective action, the AJ ordered the Agency to identify and place Mr. Crawford in a position of "like status" to an IT Specialist. The AJ also ordered, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.110(a), that if the Agency determined that no appropriate positions were available or if it was otherwise impossible or unreasonable to reassign Mr. Crawford to such a position, then the Agency should notify the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide Mr. Crawford with an opportunity to apply for placement assistance. Neither party sought review of these orders, which became final on March 31, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.209(a) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">During uniformed service. An employee may not be demoted or separated (other than military separation) while performing duty with the uniformed services except for cause. (Reduction in force is not considered "for cause" under this subpart.) He or she is not a "competing employee" under &#x00A7; 351.404 of this chapter. <span class="Italic">If the employee's position is abolished during such absence, the agency must reassign the employee to another position of like status, and pay.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.209(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313 provides in pertinent part,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;Subject to subsection (b) (in the case of any employee) and sections 4314 and 4315 (in the case of an employee of the Federal Government), a person entitled to reemployment under section 4312, upon completion of a period of service in the uniformed services, <span class="Italic">shall be promptly reemployed in a position of employment in accordance with the following</span> order of priority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), in the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than 90 days--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">(A)&#x2003;in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service, <span class="Italic">or a position of like seniority, status and pay</span>, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">(B)&#x2003;in the position of employment in which the person was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services, or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform, only if the person is not qualified to perform the duties of a position referred to in subparagraph (A) after reasonable efforts by the employer to qualify the person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency thereafter submitted a notice of compliance with the corrective action, asserting it was not able to find Mr. Crawford a position of "like status" to IT Specialist and, therefore, had requested the OPM's placement assistance. In response, Mr. Crawford filed a petition for enforcement with the Board challenging the Agency's alleged compliance with the corrective action. Mr. Crawford argued that the Agency was required to search for all positions of "like status" or the "next best" available position, "whether occupied or not" before concluding there were no appropriate positions available and transferring the matter to the OPM for placement assistance. Since the Agency's search for positions was "apparently limited to vacant positions," Mr. Crawford believed that the Agency failed to perform an adequate search and, consequently, did not comply with the ordered corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ agreed with Mr. Crawford and granted his petition for enforcement of the ordered corrective action. The Agency's search was faulted for being overly restrictive in identifying positions of "like status" because "it <span id="Page_565"></span>focused on only vacant positions." The AJ therefore recommended that the Agency conduct an agency-wide search for a position of "like status" in order to comply with the order for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency subsequently reassigned Mr. Crawford from his position as a Program Support Specialist to a position as an IT Specialist within ACE-IT (Mr. Crawford's "new position"). This new position has the same title and grade as his old position (i.e., "IT Specialist, GS-2210-11"). The new position is also located at the same duty station as the old position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Crawford appealed to the Board to contest the adequacy of his assignment to the new position. Mr. Crawford argued that while the title, grade, and location were the same as his old position, the position was nevertheless still not of "like status" to his old position. He argued that the differences in duties associated with the positions precluded them from being of "like status." In particular, Mr. Crawford asserts that his old position primarily involved hardware-related duties, such as installing, repairing, evaluating, and configuring computer systems and their associated devices, and it only required him to perform some limited software-related duties. In his new position, however, his primary duties involve software asset management and he does not have any hardware related responsibilities. Mr. Crawford also argued that he was not qualified, as required by USERRA, to perform the duties associated with his new position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board disagreed. The Board found it undisputed that Mr. Crawford's old and new positions were similar or identical with regard to pay, tenure, seniority, working conditions, and rank or responsibility. The Board weighed those factors against the alleged differences in duties and found that, despite the non-identical duties, overall the positions were similar enough to comply with the "like status" standard of USERRA. The Board also believed that Mr. Crawford was qualified for the new position since he had already performed the position satisfactorily. Additionally, any argument Mr. Crawford had regarding a lack of qualification would be overcome once he received additional training. Based on these findings, the Board concluded that the Agency was in compliance with the order for corrective action and dismissed Mr. Crawford's appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the United States Code, "Employment and Reemployment Rights of Members of the Uniformed Services," provides employment protection to those citizens called to active duty in the military services. USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-33; <span class="Italic">see also Nichols v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 11 F.3d 160, 162 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Under USERRA, an individual is entitled, following his uniformed service, to be reemployed in a position of "like seniority, status, and pay." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2). The implementing regulations note that when the employee's position is abolished during uniformed service, "the agency must reassign the employee to another position of like status, and pay." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.209(a). Although the statute does not define what is meant by "status," the implementing regulations explain that it includes "opportunities for advancement, general working conditions, job location, shift assignment, rank, responsibility, and geographical location." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.193.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no fixed test for determining whether two positions are of "like status." Rather, we have indicated that different criteria can be important in comparing the "status" associated with employment positions in a particular case. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Nichols</span>, we said, "a subsequent position must carry with it like <span class="Italic">responsibility, duties</span> and <span class="Italic">authority</span> if it is to be of like status and thus meet the requirements of the statute." <span class="Italic">Nichols</span>, 11 F.3d at 164 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (emphasis added). There, we found differences in rank and authority to be dispositive in the "like status" inquiry. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 163-64 ("It goes without saying that when one starts out as the boss, but is placed in a position subordinate to the replacement boss, and other new bosses, there is incontestably a loss of authority, and accordingly a diminished status."). We have also focused on shift assignments and working hours to evaluate "like status."[3] <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 540 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("case law establishes that 'shift assignment' and regular hours are benefits of employment" subsumed in our "status" inquiry).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The flexible approach adopted in our precedent is also consistent with how other courts have evaluated the employment "status" inquiry. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Serricchio v. Wachovia Sec. LLC</span>, 658 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir. 2011) (considering number and valuation of accounts serviced by employee prior to uniformed service); <span class="Italic">Duarte v. Agilent Techs., Inc</span>., 366 F. Supp.2d 1039, 1042, 1045-46 (D. Colo. 2005) (considering change, following employee's uniformed service, from more "primary" role to new role "providing minimal assistance to other primary" employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board considers the "totality of the circumstances" when evaluating the "status" of an employment position. The Board recognized that this approach was non-consistent with the legislative intent of USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Heidel v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 69 M.S.P.R. 511, 515, SL-0353-93-0390-C-1, 1996 WL 73314, at *2 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 13, 1996) (the legislative history "indicates congressional approval of a 'totality of the circumstances test' in determining whether a returning veteran has been restored to a position of 'like status'"). In doing so, the Board identified House Report No. 102-56, which cites with approval the federal district court's decision in <span class="Italic">Monday v. Adams Packing Ass'n, Inc</span>., 73-102-CIV-T-H, 1973 WL 958 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 6, 1973), as further support for considering the "totality of the circumstances" test. The <span class="Italic">Monday</span> court explained the inquiry as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The standards by which to measure or evaluate the relative "status" of a given job classification, as distinguished from seniority and pay comparisons, is a subject which has received little attention in the cases or the regulations. The Court concludes, however, <span class="Italic">that the relative "status" of a job is to be determined from the totality of the circumstances</span> including (in addition to seniority and pay) such considerations as opportunities for advancement, general working conditions, job location, shift assignment, rank or responsibility, etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Monday</span>, 1973 WL 958, at *3 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board's approach. A proper evaluation of "like status" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313 includes consideration of the totality of the circumstances. This interpretation is supported by the relevant implementing regulations, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.193 (listing various criteria subsumed in "status"), USERRA's legislative history, H.R. Rep. No. 56, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 28 (1991), and our case law. As with any test that considers the totality of the circumstances, certain factors cannot be singled out as dispositive without first weighing all of the other potentially competing factors. This is not to say that in some cases an individual factor cannot prove dispositive. Rather, it means that before elevating the importance of a single factor in the "like status" inquiry, the impact of that factor must be considered within the context of all other factors that are relevant to the inquiry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also important to note that the statute should be interpreted broadly in favor of individuals returning from military service. This principle has long been recognized by this Court in resolving disputes arising under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Nichols</span>, 11 F.3d at 162-63 ("The historical development of section 4301 shows that Congress intended it to be interpreted broadly in favor of those returning from military service. The original 1940 legislation was intended to offer veterans as much protection with respect to reemployment and retention of employment as is within reasonable bounds.") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Indeed, the preference of the Act is "to return the veteran to 'such position' as [she] had previously occupied." <span class="Italic">Nichols</span>, 11 F.3d at 162-63. We thus construe the statutory language to give effect to Congress' intent that a veteran not be penalized by reason of her absence, but that she retain her position, and any accrued benefits, as if she had never left. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 163.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we weigh close cases of "status" in favor of the veteran, we also acknowledge that restoring a veteran to her exact former position, in some cases, is neither desirable nor feasible. This understanding is directly implied by the regulatory scheme implemented by USERRA. For example, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.209 provides that "[i]f the employee's position is abolished during [her] absence, the agency must reassign the employee to <span class="Italic">another position</span> of like status, and pay." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.209 (emphasis added). This provision recognizes that a restoring agency is not required to recreate a position that the agency has retired or abolished. <span class="Italic">See Nichols</span>, 11 F.3d at 163 ("Even as the preference of the Act is to give the veteran his old job back, it does give the employer some discretion, 'in accordance with the dictates of sound management,' to restore the veteran to another position if it is truly of like seniority, status, and pay....") (quoting <span class="Italic">Bova v. General Mills, Inc</span>., 173 F.2d 138, 140 (6th Cir. 1949)). Thus, USERRA strikes a balance between the veteran and the practical reality of a dynamic workplace. In considering whether a veteran has been restored to a position of "like status" we are not required to ignore constraints imposed by programs, resources, and needs that do not remain static. Instead, we acknowledge the existence of considerations that evolve in tune with a progressing society.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With the foregoing considerations in mind, we turn to the Board's comparison of Mr. Crawford's old and new positions. Prior to his uniformed service, Mr. Crawford's old position was Information Technology Specialist, GS-2210-11. The Board described this position "as that of a hardware specialist in the Information Management Office." <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dep't of Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 38, 45 (M.S.P.B. 2011). The Board noted that, in his old position, Mr. Crawford's duties involved installing, repairing, evaluating, and configuring computer systems and their devices." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board specifically noted Mr. Crawford's admission that his old position, at least in part, entailed "software-related duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board therefore determined that in his old position Mr. Crawford: "(1) installed, repaired, evaluated and configured computer systems, including software systems; (2) maintained an inventory and insured proper registration and receipts for hardware and software; and (3) called vendors for resolution of problems involving hardware and software." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On Mr. Crawford's return from uniformed service, the Agency reassigned Mr. Crawford to a position quite different from his old position, presumably <span id="Page_566"></span>because his old position had been abolished. After he protested, the Agency assigned Mr. Crawford to a position at his former facility having the same classification as his old position, namely, Information Technology Specialist, GS-2210-11. Mr. Crawford's new position is within the newly created ACE-IT. The Board described Mr. Crawford's new position "as that of a software asset manager who administers, develops, delivers and supports IT systems and services." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. According to the Board, in his new position Mr. Crawford is responsible for: "(1) inventory management and logging; (2) ensuring license compliance; and (3) identifying, reporting and resolving a variety of IT issues and problems." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reviewing Mr. Crawford's old and new positions, and considering the totality of the circumstances, we do not find that the Board acted arbitrarily in determining that Mr. Crawford's old and new positions are of "like status." It is undisputed that Mr. Crawford's "new position is similar or identical to his prior position in regard to pay, tenure, seniority, working conditions, and rank or responsibility." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. These factors weigh strongly in favor of the Board's decision. Additionally, Mr. Crawford does not dispute that his new position is "in the same general information management field in which he previously worked." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with Mr. Crawford's attempts to characterize his old position as solely having duties related to hardware. The description for Mr. Crawford's old position makes reference to various responsibilities involving "software." (Appellee's App. A11.) For instance, the "Duties" of that position included maintaining "an inventory of all hardware <span class="Italic">and software</span>" and calling vendors "for hardware <span class="Italic">and software</span> resolution." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Mr. Crawford's old position also specifically required "[k]nowledge of common <span class="Italic">Off-the-Shelf software</span>...for <span class="Italic">Installation and support [of]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> users</span>" and required him to "[i]nstall Off-The-Shelf standard <span class="Italic">software; network driver</span> [sic], <span class="Italic">printer driver(s)</span>, and provide[ ] efficient memory configuration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphases added). These are software-related duties. The specification of Mr. Crawford's old position further notes that "[d]ue to rapid changes in computer technology, work requires wide-rang[ing] knowledge of functional characteristics of many new computer devices. Employee requires <span class="Italic">quick adoption of new technologies</span>... .Incumbent is required to install and configure all new and up-to-date technology." (Appellee's App. A12 (emphasis added).) In sum, Mr. Crawford's old position included software-related duties and he must have anticipated that those duties would likely require that he be able to adapt to new technologies involving software.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his new position, Mr. Crawford has expanded software responsibilities. His current duties include tracking software assets, developing software management processes and policies, and implementing a software library. He also has various responsibilities related to data storage and management. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Executing the duties of Mr. Crawford's new positions requires knowledge of and skill in applying software management concepts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Mr. Crawford is also required to "recommend new or modified standards to increase efficiency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While these duties certainly increase the focus on the software duties of an IT Specialist, we do not find that the Board acted arbitrarily in determining that this adjusted focus did not amount to a change in "status" from Mr. Crawford's old position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In many ways, the duties of Mr. Crawford's new position appear to be commensurate with the natural evolution, directed by changing needs and technological developments, of his old position. Mr. Crawford's old position included software-related duties and explicitly required the ability to adapt to a rapidly changing technical setting. In his new position, Mr. Crawford's focus on software does not represent a wholesale substitution in new duties that were entirely absent from the bundle of responsibilities and requirements of his old position. The shifted focus only reflects that the apportionment of software-related duties has increased. Thus, while some of the duties of his new position are different from his old position, we cannot say that an IT specialist would not naturally have been required to adapt to increased software-related duties as an inevitable response to the demands of evolving technological priorities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like Mr. Crawford, all of his former co-workers "all essentially lost their positions" as a result of the A-76 outsourcing. <span class="Italic">See Crawford</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. at 46. Those individuals "either successfully competed for noninformation management positions in the newly created ACE-IT, or the agency placed them in non-information management positions elsewhere within the District." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Notwithstanding Mr. Crawford's uniformed status, those co-workers were situated equally with him and they were not automatically entitled to positions within ACE-IT in the information management field. Yet, deservingly, Mr. Crawford has been assigned, without competition, to a position at ACE-IT with the same title, grade, and classification as his old position, in the same duty station, and with substantially similar duties. Conversely, many of Mr. Crawford's coworkers were not able to secure similar positions within ACE-IT. Mr. Crawford's uniformed status therefore provided him with advantages over his former co-workers in securing his new position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Crawford also argues that the Board erred by concluding that he was qualified, or could be qualified through reasonable efforts, to perform the duties of his new position. The record does not support these contentions. To the contrary, the record indicates that Mr. Crawford was already performing the duties of his new position and his supervisor declared that such duties required little or no formal training. Based on these facts and considering the substantial overlapping duties between his old and new positions, as described above, we do not find that it was arbitrary for the Board to conclude that Mr. Crawford satisfied the qualification requirements of his new position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of these considerations, we conclude that the Board did not act arbitrarily or contrary to law in determining that, despite some differences in duties, Mr. Crawford's old and new positions are of "like status" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having considered the balance of Mr. Crawford's arguments, we find no reversible error in the determinations of the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">West v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEST_MISTY_J_AT_4324_10_0736_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_646401.pdf">117 MSPR 24</a>, 27-28 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-13, 2011 MSPB 88 (2011), some changes in working conditions and status were unobjectionable under USERRA because the changes would likely have occurred were the appellant not on military duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant reiterates her argument that she is not doing the same job because the agency realigned the position. Specifically, she claims that before her active duty service, she was in charge of "millions of dollars and massive amounts of data used by the entire Air Force," but now she is "in charge of nothing," and she is in a position of less responsibility than before. The appellant also contends that the administrative judge incorrectly found that the appellant reported to the same supervisor before and after her absence serving on active duty. She also argued below that a lower-ranking official assigned her tasks as a result of the realignment of her position during her absence, and claimed "this was essentially a step backwards for me."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments fail because the agency was not obligated to return the appellant to her former position, but instead was required to place the appellant in the position she would have held but for her uniformed service. Therefore, even if the appellant's current position is not the same as her former position, the agency has not violated her reemployment rights if the evidence shows that it returned her to the position she would have held absent her uniformed service. In any event, the administrative judge found that the agency "has the discretion to realign its workforce" and she found no evidence that the scope of the appellant's duties changed. In addition, the appellant identifies no requirement that she have the exact same supervisor both before and after her absence for active military service. Further, the appellant does not assert, and the record does not reflect, that the authority, grade, or duties of her supervisors changed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In complaining that her position has been realigned and that a lower-ranking individual gives her assignments, the appellant essentially argues that the agency placed her in the same position, but that position does not carry the same status as it did before she left for active duty. Evidence that a position is not of like seniority, status and pay may, in an appropriate case, be relevant to a determination of whether the position is the position the employee would have held but for her uniformed service. Here, however, the appellant essentially concedes that she has been returned to her former position, which still exists at the agency, and the evidence shows that she was not entitled to a promotion to GS-12 on her return to duty. Even assuming that her former job has changed in the manner the appellant alleges, it is the job she would have held absent her uniformed service. It is possible that, if she had not been absent performing uniformed service, the appellant might have sought reassignment to a different position if she found her duties and responsibilities had been reduced, but whether she would have sought reassignment and whether she would have been afforded a reassignment if she had are far too speculative to permit the Board to conclude that she would have occupied some other position but for her uniformed service. Any hypothetical reassignment would have involved the exercise of a discriminating management choice, and would not be reasonably certain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency placed the appellant in the position in which she would have been employed if her employment had not been interrupted by her uniformed service. Therefore, the agency has satisfied its statutory obligations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">e.g., Leite</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6; 8; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 540 F.3d 1364, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2008), determined that the agency erred by failing to provide a shift differential to a veteran returning to a position that should have been assigned to him instead of a different position at a lower pay rate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA represents Congress's most recent effort to create a comprehensive statutory scheme to provide civilian reemployment rights for those who serve in the armed forces in order "to encourage <span id="Page_567"></span>noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service." 38 U.S.C. 4301(a). The Act also aims "to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service," and "to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> USERRA was enacted specifically to "restructure, clarify, and improve" the prior reemployment benefits statutes. S. Rep. No. 102-203, at 27 (1991). While Congress intended to expand and clarify the prior statutes, the legislative history stated that the "extensive body of case law" under the predecessor statutes "would remain in full force and effect to the extent consistent" with USERRA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA, Mr. Smith was entitled to be reemployed in a position of "like seniority, status and pay." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A). Implementing regulations define "status" to include "opportunities for advancement, general working conditions, job location, <span class="Italic">shift assignment</span>, rank responsibility, and geographical location." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.193 (emphasis added). Case law establishes that "shift assignment" and regular hours are benefits of employment. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. Michelin N. Am., Inc.</span>, 252 F.3d 307, 313 (4th Cir. 2001) ("we believe that the Q-Laboratory's more regular schedule is properly viewed as an advantage of the job under USERRA's definition of 'benefit of employment.'"); <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 142 F.3d 1444, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (stating that "daytime hours," which "most workers consider desirable" are an "incident or advantage of employment."); <span class="Italic">Carlson v. N.H. Dep't of Safety</span>, 609 F.2d 1024, 1027 (1st Cir. 1979) ("We cannot say that the transfer, due to plaintiff's reserve training, from a basically 8 to 5 weekday job to one with weekend work and shifts which may fall during any hour of the day or night is not a denial of an incident or advantage of employment"). In the event that an agency does not comply with its obligations under USERRA, the Board is required "to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service contends that the Board correctly held that Mr. Smith would be entitled to compensation only if other employees in the East Texas Processing and Distribution Center who held the full-time custodian position worked irregular shifts during the period that Mr. Smith was in his part-time position. Because the evidence indicated that none of those employees worked irregular shifts during that time, and thus none earned premium pay for working irregular shifts, the Postal Service argues that Mr. Smith is likewise not entitled to any award of premium pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That argument misses the point. The employees in the full-time custodian positions enjoyed a benefit that Mr. Smith did not--a regular tour of duty. With respect to that benefit, Mr. Smith was worse off than the employees in the full-time custodian positions. The applicable regulations, binding on the Postal Service, define "status" for USERRA purposes to include "shift assignment," indicating that a favorable shift assignment is a benefit, and section 4324(c)(2) of USERRA directs that loss of benefits must be compensated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similar compensation has been provided under other federal labor laws providing relief for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Gaffney v. Riverboat Servs. of Ind., Inc.</span>, 451 F.3d 424, 462 (7th Cir. 2006) (where employee earned more money by working longer hours at a lower rate at his post-termination job, the backpay award under 46 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2114 was properly adjusted to account for the number of hours he would have worked in his original job); <span class="Italic">Gaworski v. ITT Commercial Fin. Corp.</span>, 17 F.3d 1104, 1111 (8th Cir. 1994) (compensation awarded for "job search" expenses under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 621 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>); <span class="Italic">F.E. Hazard, Ltd. v. NLRB</span>, 917 F.2d 736, 738 (2d Cir. 1990) (compensation awarded for ordinary and necessary business expenses incurred during period of interim earnings under National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158(a)(1), (3), (4)). Similar compensation has also been awarded under the predecessor compensation statute to USERRA, which used virtually identical language. <span class="Italic">Eidukonis v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth.</span>, 757 F. Supp. 634, 640 (E.D. Pa. 1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 944 F.2d 896 (3d Cir. 1991) (table) (compensation awarded for out-of-pocket medical expenses under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2022).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that none of the custodians in the East Texas Processing and Distribution Center during the period in question received out-of-schedule premium pay is irrelevant. Unlike the full-time custodians, Mr. Smith worked irregular shifts without compensation and thus did not enjoy the benefit that they enjoyed (and that he would have enjoyed if he had been placed directly into the custodian position). The deprivation of that benefit is compensable as a loss of a "shift assignment" benefit.</p>

Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3249) (active duty member was not discriminated against when the military declined to permit him to transfer his reemployment rights to another installation than the site of his original position; favoritism relative to transfer opportunities to other members of the military was not actionable under USERRA because there was no discrimination based upon military status).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a) sets forth the purposes of USERRA, one of which is "to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(3). In furtherance of that aim,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a] person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation to perform service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). The grammar of the statute, as well as legislative history, indicate that the intent of Congress was to prohibit both discrimination based on the possession of military obligations and reprisal for the undertaking or performance of such obligations. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 17 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2450 (reported bill would "[c]ontinue to prohibit discrimination or acts of reprisal against an employee or applicant for employment because of a past, current, or future military obligation...."); 140 Cong. Rec. H9117, 9133 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1994) (statement of Cong. Montgomery) (section 4311 "prohibits discrimination and related acts of reprisal against persons who serve in the uniformed services"); 140 Cong. Rec. S13,634 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1994) (statement of Sen. Rockefeller) (chapter 43 of title 38 would "[c]ontinue to protect employees or applicants for employment from discrimination or reprisal based on their military obligation...."). Thus, &#x00A7; 4311(a) protects both military status, e.g., membership in the reserves, and military activity, e.g., performance of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most significant and predictable consequence of reserve status with respect to the employer is the employee's absence from work. <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009). For this reason, USERRA prohibits an employer from taking an adverse employment action based on the employee's use of or obligation to use military leave. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this case, however, the appellant contends that the agency denied him a benefit of employment[3] based not only on his reservist status and use of military leave, but also on conflicts with management over his specific military assignments. Furthermore, while the agency cites the appellant's alleged performance issues as a reason for denying his request for a tour extension, it is undisputed that its decision was based in part on his interactions with Walsh and Stenkamp regarding his drafting the report for his military supervisors and participation in the Army's videoconference.[4] We therefore consider whether and to what extent USERRA prohibits an employing agency from taking adverse employment actions based on an employee's specific military duties and the manner in which they are performed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We find that by denying the appellant's request for a tour extension, the agency denied him a "benefit of employment" within the meaning of USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2) (defining "benefit of employment" to include "the opportunity to select...location of employment"); <span class="Italic">see also Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 235-36 (1996) (finding legislative history supports an expansive interpretation of "benefit of employment"); 140 Cong. Rec. H. at 9133 (statement of Cong. Montgomery) ("the intent has always been to have an expansive interpretation").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Because Arrivillaga, Steffick, and Stenkamp intended for the appellant's request to be denied, and their nonconcurrences were a proximate cause of Hornstein's final decision, the Board may find a violation of &#x00A7; 4311(a) even if Hornstein himself did not improperly consider the appellant's military service. <span class="Italic">See Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1186, 1194 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of the statute, the term "service in the uniformed services" means</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty, a period for which a person is absent from a position of employment for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any such duty, and a period for which a person is absent from employment for the purpose of performing funeral honors duty as authorized by section 12503 of title 10 or section 115 of title 32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(13). These examples suggest that in enacting &#x00A7; 4311(a), Congress was concerned primarily with acts of discrimination and reprisal based on the fact of an employee's military service and the absences such service entails. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65 at 21 (explaining that under &#x00A7; 4303(2), the term "benefit of employment," as used in &#x00A7; 4311(a) and <span id="Page_568"></span>elsewhere in USERRA, is "broadly defined to include all attributes of the employment relationship which are affected by the absence of a member of the uniformed services because of military service").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, canons of statutory construction dictate that the use of the word "includes" means the examples included under &#x00A7; 4303(13) are intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. <span class="Italic">Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp</span>., 132 S. Ct. 2156, 2170 (2012); <span class="Italic">Solamon v. Department of Commerce</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 12 (2012). Furthermore, "[b]ecause USERRA was enacted to protect the rights of veterans and members of the uniformed services, it must be broadly construed in favor of military beneficiaries." <span class="Italic">Hill v. Michelin North America, Inc.,</span> 252 F.3d 307, 312-313 (4th Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">see Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp</span>., 447 U.S. 191, 196 (1980) (construing USERRA's predecessor liberally in favor of military members); H.R. Rep. No. 103-65 at 22 ("The Committee intends that these antidiscrimination provisions be broadly construed and strictly enforced."). Like absence from work, conflict between an employee's specific military assignments and the interests of the civilian employer is a possible, albeit less common and foreseeable, consequence of an employee's military service. To allow reservists to face the prospect of adverse treatment by their civilian employers based on their military orders would be contrary to the overarching aim of Congress to "encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service." <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(1); <span class="Italic">cf. Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368. Accordingly, we conclude that USERRA should be read to prohibit adverse employment actions based on the content and performance of any military assignment, general or specific.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This does not imply that USERRA prohibits an employer from considering events which occur during a period of service but do not constitute performance of military duty. <span class="Italic">Strausbaugh v. Government Printing Office</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 12, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 493 F. App'x 61 (Fed. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 133 S. Ct. 1286 (2013). Nor does USERRA prohibit an employer from taking action against an employee for gratuitous misconduct in the course of performing military duties. <span class="Italic">Cf. Escher v. BWT Y-12, LLC</span>, 627 F.3d 1020, 1024-25, 1032 (6th Cir. 2010) (employer did not violate &#x00A7; 4311(b) when it terminated the employee for doing Naval Reserve business at work in violation of company policy). The protection of employment under &#x00A7; 4311 is based upon the employee's compliance with the reasonable and ordinarily accepted standards of personal conduct and performance of all employees. <span class="Italic">Figueroa Reyes v. Hosp. San Pablo del Este</span>, 389 F. Supp.2d 205, 212 (D.P.R. 2005). To the extent the appellant may have violated those standards, and was not required to do so by his military orders, his activity was not protected under &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, to the extent an employee's military duties are themselves at odds with the interests of the civilian employer, the employer may not take action against the employee on that basis. If, as the appellant asserts, the agency would have renewed his tour but for his specific military assignments, the agency violated USERRA regardless of whether its action was also based on his reservist status and general military obligation. We remand the appeal to provide the parties an opportunity to present additional evidence and argument in light of our holding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Administrative Judge Must Make Additional Credibility Determinations on Remand</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who claims that an agency violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) in taking an adverse employment action bears the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee's military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the action. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). If the appellant meets his initial burden, the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating, as an affirmative defense, that it would have taken the action for a valid reason without regard to the employee's military service. <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368; <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013; <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c).

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's military service is a motivating factor for an adverse employment action if the employer "relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision" on that service. <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368; <span class="Italic">see Escher</span>, 627 F.3d at 1026 ("Protected status is a motivating factor if a truthful employer would list it, if asked, as one of the reasons for its decision."). The factual question of discriminatory motivation or intent may be proven by either direct or circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. Discriminatory motivation under USERRA "may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors, including proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses."[5] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "In determining whether the employee has proven that his protected status or activity was part of the motivation for the agency's conduct, all record evidence may be considered, including the agency's explanation for the actions taken." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board has in some cases suggested that in order to establish discrimination under USERRA, an appellant must show that he was treated more harshly than employees without protected status. <span class="Italic">See Strausbaugh</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Fahrenbacher v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6; 18 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d 1009. However, it is well established that comparator evidence is only one means by which an employee may establish a discriminatory motive. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014; <span class="Italic">see Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1369 (where employee was removed for excessive use of military leave, the fact that the agency could have lawfully removed him if his absence had not been service related did not excuse its action); <span class="Italic">cf. Davis v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (the administrative judge erred in requiring the appellant to show that she was treated more harshly than a similarly situated individual who was not a member of her protected class under Title VII).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he did not in fact breach the agency's chain of command policy in contacting Walsh, and that the agency's proffered explanation was pretext for discrimination based on his reserve status and disputes with management over his military leave and military assignments. Based on the current record, there is a question as to whether the appellant acted entirely within the chain of command. The appellant contends that, given Stenkamp's approval to use the FSR, he did not violate the chain of command by sending a draft report to Walsh "as a courtesy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, assuming the appellant and Walsh obtained Stenkamp's approval to use the FSR, it remains undisputed that the appellant did not contact his supervisors before requesting information from Walsh. The appellant further argues that in his interactions with Walsh and Stenkamp he was acting in his capacity as a military officer, and therefore was not subject to the agency chain of command in the first instance. However, the appellant was not on military duty when he first approached Walsh for assistance with the report on July 7, 2010. Furthermore, the appellant indicated in his July 20, 2010 correspondence that he was acting in a dual capacity as a military officer and civilian DEA agent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conversely, the record contains evidence indicating that the appellant's conduct, even if technically a breach of the chain of command, was considered acceptable at LCO. First, it is undisputed that there was no written chain of command policy. Furthermore, contrary to the testimony of the appellant's supervisors, Walsh testified that Special Agents are free to bring intelligence related questions to an intelligence analyst in the office without first meeting with an immediate supervisor, and that he did not believe the appellant acted inappropriately. Walsh's testimony was corroborated by Erika Jiminez, a Special Agent at LCO, who testified that there was an open door policy at LCO, and that, based on her experience, the environment was such that she or the appellant could freely approach Walsh and ask for help. In the absence of a specific agency instruction that would have prohibited the appellant from contacting Walsh without going through his supervisors, and in light of the evidence that such actions were condoned by management, it is questionable whether the agency could have properly considered the appellant's breach of the chain of command as a factor in denying his request for a tour extension. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 55 (2011). If credited, the testimony of Walsh and Jiminez could therefore serve as circumstantial evidence that the agency's reliance on the chain of command issue as a basis for its action was pretext for discrimination based on the appellant's military service. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014 (discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from factors including inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer). However, the administrative judge did not acknowledge or attempt to resolve the conflict between their testimony and that of Arrivillaga, Steffick, and Stenkamp. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests). The administrative judge should make the necessary credibility determinations on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further testified that, following his February 20, 2010 request for leave, Arrivillaga told him that he would not grant his request for 4 full weeks because the appellant had just come back from "vacation," and that he was not inclined to approve of "more" vacation. The appellant asserted that Arrivillaga's tone, demeanor, and choice of words indicated that he was equating his military duty to vacation, thereby showing disrespect for his military service. If credited, the appellant's account of Arrivillaga's reaction to his leave request would constitute evidence of <span id="Page_569"></span>animosity based on the appellant's military service. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014 (discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from factors including an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity). For his part, Arrivillaga testified that he did not use the word "vacation," and did not view the appellant's military orders to be equivalent to a vacation. However, while the administrative judge found Arrivillaga's testimony to be "detailed" and "in every respect credible and convincing," he did not acknowledge the appellant's testimony or attempt to resolve the conflict between his testimony and Arrivillaga's. Again, the administrative judge should make the required credibility determination on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board affirmed the AJ's determination that the agency did not violate USERRA by its treatment of the appellant's request for a tour extension, <span class="Italic">McMillan v. DOJ</span>, DC-4324-11-0726-B-1 (NP 10/16/2014) (rev'd, remanded, <span class="Italic">McMillan v. DOJ</span>, 812 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2016), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that an employer violates section 4311(a) if it would not have taken the adverse employment action but for the employee's military service or obligation. <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368; <span class="Italic">see</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 23 (1993), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2457. However, as we explained in our remand order in this case, USERRA does not prohibit an employer from taking action against an employee for gratuitous misconduct in the course of performing military duties. <span class="Italic">See McMillan</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">cf. Escher v. BWXT Y-12, LLC</span>, 627 F.3d 1020, 1024-25, 1032 (6th Cir. 2010) (employer did not violate section 4311(b) when it terminated the employee for doing Naval Reserve business at work in violation of agency policy). Protection under USERRA is contingent on the employee's compliance with the reasonable and ordinarily accepted standards of personal conduct and performance of all employees. <span class="Italic">McMillan</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 17 (citing <span class="Italic">Figueroa Reyes v. Hosp. San Pablo del Este</span>, 389 F. Supp.2d 205, 212 (D.P.R. 2005)). Hence, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that management denied the tour extension based solely on the appellant's conduct in connection with his military assignments, and not on performance issues, there was no USERRA violation if the appellant failed to comply with ordinary accepted standards of personal conduct and performance in the course of fulfilling his military assignments. <span class="Italic">See McMillan</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant did not comply with those standards. First, as discussed above, even if the appellant acted within the bounds of the agency's open door policy when he initially approached M.W., he nonetheless violated the chain of command by seeking P.S.'s approval to use the FSR without first going through his first- and second-level supervisors. Second, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's July 20, 2012 email to P.S. was disrespectful in tone and content. On review, the appellant contends that the email was not improper because it was sent while he was on military duty and concerned his military assignment. However, as we noted in our remand order, the appellant identified himself in the July 20, 2010 email as a Special Agent (his civilian job title), and he had also indicated in previous correspondence with M.W. that he was acting in his dual capacity as a military officer and DEA agent. <span class="Italic">See McMillan</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6, 21. Given the appellant's failure to comply with the ordinarily accepted standards of conduct in the course of performing his military duties, we find that he has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that he is not entitled to corrective action under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reviewed the legal significance of the denial of the tour extension to McMillan based on what he thought was approval to use a DEA report in an analysis he was preparing during a period of military service and regarding an email exchange with DEA supervision, alleged by DEA to be disrespectful, concerning McMillan's representation of DEA at a military conference. The court determined that the Board failed properly to apply burdens of proof under <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and concluded that McMillan established a USERRA violation, <span class="Italic">McMillan v. DOJ</span>, 812 F.3d 1364, 1371-81 (Fed. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resolution of McMillan's appeal turns on this court's interpretation of USERRA, the purpose of which is, among other things, "to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services." <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(3). The operative provision in this case is 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, which provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that, "[a] person who...has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied...any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of...performance of service." &#x00A7; 4311(a). And, further, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c) &#x2003;An employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;under subsection (a), if the person's membership, application for membership, service, application for service, or obligation for service in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such membership, application for membership, service, application for service, or obligation for service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 4311(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001), this court articulated the analysis the Board must employ in a USERRA case. In <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> we held that, "an employee making a USERRA claim of discrimination...bear[s] the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee's military service was 'a substantial or motivating factor' in the adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1013. Once the employee has made the requisite showing, "the employer then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Notably, however, "an employer can not treat employees on military duty like those on nonmilitary leave of absence." <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 571 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 142 F.3d 1444, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The factual question of discriminatory motivation or intent may be proven by either direct or circumstantial evidence." <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. As we have explained, "military service is a motivating factor for an adverse employment action if the employer 'relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision' on the employee's military-related absence or obligation." <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368 (quoting <span class="Italic">Petty v. Metro. Gov't of Nashville-Davidson Cty.</span>, 538 F.3d 431, 446 (6th Cir. 2008)). Because employers rarely concede an improper motivation for their employment actions, we recognized in <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> that employees may satisfy their burden to establish that their military service or obligation was a motive in the challenged action by submitting evidence from which such a motive may be fairly inferred. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> describes four, non-exclusive factors that should help the Board determine whether a discriminatory motivation may be reasonably inferred in any given USERRA challenge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Discriminatory motivation under the USERRA may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors, including [1] proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, [2] inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, [3] an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and [4] disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">240 F.3d at 1014 (numbering added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Much, therefore, hinges on whether the testimony before the Board was sufficient to allow a reasonable inference that the adverse employment action at issue was discriminatory under USERRA. If McMillan demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the denial of his request for a tour extension, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1013, the Board must shift the burden to the government to demonstrate, also by a preponderance of the evidence, that the adverse employment action would have taken place for a valid reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The</span> Sheehan<span class="Italic"> Factors</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board never formally shifted the burden to the government because it concluded that McMillan failed to meet his initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service and obligations were relied on, taken into account, or considered in the adverse employment action. Whether a petitioner's military service was a motivating factor in the employment decision is a flexible inquiry. We conclude that the evidence permits only one reasonable finding: the evidence establishes the presence of all four of the <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> factors, which together demonstrate that McMillan satisfied his burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timing of the Adverse Action</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first factor discussed in <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> is the "proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1014. McMillan approached Walsh on July 7, 2010 for assistance with completing his military obligation, to produce an "Intel Assessment," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 630. McMillan's military leave was from July 17 through July 26, 2010. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 631. The email communications that gave rise to the adverse employment action, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 918-23, 960-62, are dated between July 19 and July 22, 2010, during McMillan's military leave. Upon his return to the DEA, McMillan was presented with a disciplinary memorandum on July 26, 2010, which "establish[ed] clear and precise guidelines from Lima Country Office management in light of recent issues regarding" McMillan. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 924-25. And, while McMillan had received an overall "Outstanding" performance rating in 2008, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 874, and 2009, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 888, he received a "Significantly Exceeds Expectations" rating in October 2010, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 903--a downgrade--after he took his military leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McMillan requested a tour extension on September 14, 2010, <span class="Italic">less than two months after his military leave</span>. It was denied the next day on September 15, 2010. The timing of the adverse action, therefore, favors McMillan's <span id="Page_570"></span>claim that there was discriminatory motivation in violation of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Inconsistencies Between the Employer's Reasons and Actions</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> factor looks to the "inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer." 240 F.3d at 1014. The AJ identified three reasons for the denial of McMillan's request for a tour extension, each of which is at least somewhat inconsistent with DEA's other actions and explanations for its treatment of McMillan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the AJ pointed to "performance issues," which are considered in terms of the number of arrests, seizures, informant recruitment, and disruptions of criminal organizations facilitated by McMillan. Second, it found that McMillan failed to follow his chain of command in soliciting assistance with his military assignment. Third, it found that McMillan's email to Stenkamp was "disrespectful and improper" and "arroga[nt]." We find inconsistencies with respect to each of these reasons, making reliance on them questionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Expressed Hostility</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> factor that may lead to an inference of discriminatory motivation is the "expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity." 240 F.3d at 1014. While the Board made no finding one way or the other, Stenkamp's emails to McMillan ordering him not to represent DEA during the SVTC cannot be reasonably construed as anything but hostile to McMillan's military assignment. While Stenkamp may not have been hostile to McMillan's need to do his military service, he certainly was hostile to McMillan's military obligations once he focused on what those obligations entailed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disparate Treatment of Other Employees</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fourth factor discussed in <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> as indicative of discriminatory motivation is the "disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses." 240 F.3d at 1014. McMillan points to the DEA's treatment of Walsh as evidence that non-military employees were treated differently....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Government's Burden</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that McMillan carried his burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee's veteran status was "a substantial or motivating factor for an adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368. Because the Board did not find that McMillan successfully carried his burden, it never shifted the burden to the DEA. Because McMillan has made the requisite showing, "the [DEA] then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason." <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013. At oral argument, attorneys for both parties agreed that, if this court were to find that McMillan carried his burden, no remand is necessary to provide the government with an additional opportunity to meet its burden. As such, we rely on the evidence of record, as the parties have invited us to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must determine, therefore, whether DEA adduced evidence sufficient to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have denied McMillan's request for a tour renewal despite the protected activity. The first step is defining what activity was protected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, this court applied the "substantial or motivating factor" analysis from <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>. <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 571 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2009). There, a Postal Service employee was absent from his position for almost five years during his service in the National Guard. The Postal Service removed Mr. Erickson from his position, noting as its reason "his excessive use of military leave." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1368. The court noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n employer cannot escape liability under USERRA by claiming that it was merely discriminating against an employee on the basis of his absence when that absence was for military service. As other courts have held, military service is a motivating factor for an adverse employment action if the employer "relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision" on the employee's military-related absence or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">571 F.3d at 1368 (quoting <span class="Italic">Petty</span>, 538 F.3d at 446). Indeed, "the overarching goal of [USERRA] is to prevent those who serve in the uniformed services from being disadvantaged by virtue of performing their military obligations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service is "entitled to remove an employee for prolonged <span class="Italic">nonmilitary</span> leaves of absence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1369 (emphasis added). But "an employer can not treat employees on military duty like those on non-military leave of absence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 142 F.3d at 1447). "Congress enacted USERRA in part to make clear that discrimination in employment occurs when a person's military service is 'a motivating factor,' and not to require...that military service be the sole motivating factor for the adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">Id. Erickson</span> stands for the proposition that, even when an employee's acts--in that case prolonged absence--would justify the agency's adverse employment action if not related to his military service, USERRA is violated if the frowned-upon acts of the employee are required by the military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, unlike in <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, McMillan was not obligated to seek assistance from his colleagues and superiors at DEA to fulfill his military obligations, and he does not allege that he was obligated by his military supervisors to use the FSR. In the end, of course, he fulfilled his military duties without referring to the FSR in his intelligence report. The question is whether the complained-of actions are so related to his military obligations--as in <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>--that it would be improper to consider them in an adverse employment action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board resolved this issue against McMillan, finding that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Protection under USERRA is contingent on the employee's compliance with the reasonable and ordinarily accepted standards of personal conduct and performance of all employees. Hence, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that management denied the tour extension based solely on the appellant's conduct in connection with his military assignments, and not on performance issues, there was no USERRA violation if the appellant failed to comply with ordinary accepted standards of personal conduct and performance in the course of fulfilling his military assignments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">J.A. 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Figueroa Reyes</span>, 389 F. Supp.2d at 212).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But as the discussion above makes clear, DEA failed to establish that two of its proffered reasons--McMillan's alleged performance issues and his failure to follow the chain of command--were "ordinary accepted standards of personal conduct and performance." The tone in McMillan's emails, moreover, is simply not egregious enough to independently support the DEA's burden under the preponderance standard, especially considering that it was triggered by Stenkamp's reaction to McMillan's reasonable request for assistance in fulfilling his military obligations. If McMillan's alleged "arrogance, disrespect and condescension," were characteristic, then surely the government could have adduced evidence of additional examples of his misconduct that were wholly unrelated to his military service. It did not. Instead, McMillan's previous performance reviews indicated that there were no such issues. Indeed, all of the proffered reasons for the denial of McMillan's tour extension were related to the project McMillan was assigned to perform as part of his military service and the interactions with LCO command in connection thereto. Again, while the DEA may have been unhappy with McMillan's military assignment, it was not entitled to punish him for attempting to fulfill it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not intend to give <span class="Italic">carte blanche</span> to employees to engage in misconduct in service of their military duties under the protection of USERRA. But once the petitioner meets his burden, an employer must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the non-military-service justifications for the adverse employment action are legally sufficient. For all of the reasons explained, the DEA failed to demonstrate that it would have made the same decision in the absence of McMillan's military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because substantial evidence does not support the Board's finding that McMillan failed to meet his burden under USERRA, and because the testimony proffered below by the government is insufficient to satisfy its burden, we reverse the ruling of the Board that USERRA was not violated, and remand for determination of an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-314.html#sec1-307">Failure to Appoint</a>" for <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">USERRA return rights are ordinarily applied as to the agency that employed the appellant when he departed for military service, <span class="Italic">Daly v. DHS</span>, NY-315H-11-0325-I-1 (NP 10/22/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that he was denied continued employment after returning from military service. In this regard, we note that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a) provides, among other things, that a person who is absent from employment because of service in the uniformed services has a right to reemployment if that person has given advance notice of such service to his or her employer, and the person timely reports or submits an application for reemployment. The appellant was apparently employed by the Department of the Army in 2005 when he took leave to perform military service. Thus, to the extent that the appellant is alleging that his USERRA reemployment rights were violated when he was not offered continued employment, such a claim would need to be brought against the Army.</p>
