<p class="Body-Text">Depending on the severity, frequency, and impact, physical contact of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment, 29 CFR 1604.11 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Harassment on the basis of sex is a violation of section 703 of title VII. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Physical contact is considered an aggravating circumstance in sexual harassment; removal is justified for one incident. <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 85, 89 (1988) (offensive touchings; inappropriate comments); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 68, 96 (1994) (quoting EEOC Policy Guidance: "[U]nwelcome physical contact can 'seriously poison the victim's working environment[.] '"); <span class="Italic">Jordan v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 225, 229 (1990) (defining sexual harassment to include unwelcome remarks with a sexual connotation or physical contacts of a sexual nature); <span class="Italic">Pugh v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 326, 327 (1984) (setting aside mitigation of removal: physical contact is an aggravating factor that may be relied upon by an agency as a basis of a more severe penalty than might otherwise be warranted); <span class="Italic">Butler v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 45, 52 (1982) (sustaining removal for conduct that included assault or attempted assault; there was no evidence of discriminatory intent relative to the suspension rather than removal of a white supervisor accused of comparable misconduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An isolated incident met the standard of sexual harassment under EEOC standards, <span class="Italic">Isaacs v. VA</span>, AT-0752-11-0710-I-1 (NP 4/21/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To establish a charge of sexual harassment under Title VII based on a hostile work environment, the agency must show that the conduct was offensive, based on the victim's sex, unwelcome, and sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with the victim's job performance or to create an abusive work environment. <span class="Italic">Booker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 13 (2008). The environment must be both one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive and one that was subjectively perceived as such by the victim. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc</span>., 510 U.S. 17, 21-22 (1993). Whether an environment is hostile or abusive within the meaning of the law requires an examination of all the circumstances; no single factor is conclusive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An isolated incident of sexual harassment must be "extremely serious" to violate Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Booker</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 72, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (EEOC Policy Guidance), Section (C)(2) (Mar. 19, 1990) ("a single, unusually severe incident of harassment may be sufficient to constitute a Title VII violation[.]&#8205;&#8197;...This is particularly true when the harassment is physical.") The EEOC states in its policy guidance that, "[m]ore so than in the case of verbal advances or remarks, a single unwelcome physical advance can seriously poison the victim's working environment." EEOC Policy Guidance, Section (C)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant engaged in conduct that was based on the sex of the employee whom he kissed and that was clearly offensive and unwelcome. Moreover, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's acts of kissing the employee on the cheek, holding her cheeks and kissing her on the lips, and then telling her "now you know what it is like to be kissed by a white man," were sufficiently severe to be actionable under Title VII. The Board has found a Title VII violation in similar circumstances where a mailroom clerk grabbed a co-worker's face between his hands and kissed her twice. <span class="Italic">See Viens v. Department of the Interior</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2002). Accordingly, because the administrative judge correctly sustained the first specification under the agency's charge of sexual harassment, he properly sustained the charge. <span class="Italic">See Blake v. Department of Justice</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 26 (1999) (proof of one or more, but not all of the specifications supporting a charge is sufficient to support the charge).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A single episode of physical contact warranted removal of an employee who was previously counseled about sexual harassment by an employer with a "zero tolerance" policy in <span class="Italic">Devall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 434, 436-38 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (1999) (following remand from <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">vacating</span> <span class="Italic">Devall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 500, 503-04 (1997)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the charge of sexual harassment, the agency alleged as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On or about 17 May 1995, you [the appellant] went to Room 216, Building 40, on a routine service call.... You were escorted to the room by ATAN [a military designation] Scarlett Evans, who was there to ensure security for the room and its contents. You asked her to enter the bathroom...to assist you and provide opinions on the needed repairs. In this confined space, in two separate instances, you leaned over ATAN Evans and brushed against her. In another instance, you inappropriately touched ATAN Evans with your hand on her buttocks. These instances created an intimidating and offensive environment for her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that "the appellant did, on at least two occasions, deliberately and inappropriately touch Evans in a sexually suggestive manner," by twice pushing his torso against hers while standing behind her and by touching her buttocks with his hand. He further found that the appellant's actions offended and intimidated Evans who was then 19 years old. In a sexual harassment case, physical contact is an aggravating factor<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Jordan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 44 MSPR 225, 232 (1990), <span class="Italic">recons. denied,</span> 49 MSPR 544 (1991). In addition, deciding official Korthals testified that the appellant's misconduct was particularly serious because of the nature of his job. He explained that the appellant's maintenance duties required him to go into Base housing, where women were often home by themselves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant underwent formal training on prevention of sexual harassment on several occasions, and knew or should have known that such behavior was unacceptable and would not be tolerated by the agency. Indeed, Korthals testified that the agency had a "zero tolerance" policy regarding sexual harassment. Moreover, the appellant was previously counseled on two separate occasions by Fannaly due to similar past complaints. These complaints involved allegations that he repeatedly and deliberately made sexually suggestive physical contact with military wives when he was dispatched to make repairs in their homes and that such behavior rendered one woman apprehensive and <span id="Page_2668"></span>frightened to the point that she climbed from her back balcony to her neighbor's balcony to avoid him. Due to these complaints, the appellant was specifically "cautioned...about the ramifications" of such conduct and "how it could affect Public Works creditability [sic] and the difficulty in getting future work done in housing." He was also warned that harsher discipline would be imposed for further misconduct of this nature. Korthals testified that the appellant's misconduct in sexually harassing Evans was intolerable to the agency especially in light of his having previously received training and counseling against such misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant never admitted wrongdoing or expressed remorse for his misconduct, and the deciding official believed that he had no rehabilitative potential. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee Wynne v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 75 MSPR 127, 137 (1997). The deciding official stated that "trust is a very important factor" with respect to the nature of the appellant's position and that he had to "have complete trust and faith in [the appellant] that he would never do anything like this," but the appellant had "destroyed that trust."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant had 13 years of satisfactory service with no prior disciplinary record. Nevertheless, based on the circumstances discussed above, we find that the agency's decision to remove the appellant was not beyond the maximum limits of reasonableness<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Payne v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 419, 428-30 (1997) (removal was within the maximum limits of reasonableness for a charge of sexual harassment involving physical contact arising out of a single incident, despite nearly 10 years of service with no prior disciplinary record), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 135 F.3d 776 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table); <span class="Italic">Pugh v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 20 MSPR 326, 327 (1984) (removal was within the bounds of reasonableness for charge of sexual harassment involving physical contact arising out of a single incident, where the appellant was fully advised of the impropriety of such conduct, and, although he was not a supervisor, his position entailed constant contact with women).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Inappropriate physical contact involving a coworker warranted removal, and reversal of mitigation by the AJ, when, while on duty and on the agency's premises, the appellant kissed an employee on the cheek, made the employee subsequently feel uncomfortable when the employee acquiesced in a hug, and when the appellant later send the employee an e-card with a cupid on it. Over the dissent of Member Sapin, who felt the agency overreacted by reason of conduct not stated in the proposal notice, <span class="Italic">Batts v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BATTS_FRED_D_DC_0752_04_0233_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246845.pdf">102 MSPR 27</a>, 28-32 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-15, 2006 MSPB 118 (2006), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the position of GS-13 Alternative Dispute Resolution Coordinator on December 20, 2003, based on a charge of "misconduct." The agency specified as follows: (1) On October 25, 2002, the appellant kissed another employee, Kelly Geer, on the cheek and would have kissed her on the mouth if she had not turned her head; and (2) during the third week of October 2002, the appellant pressured Geer for a hug, and when she acquiesced, he pressed his entire body against her, which made her uncomfortable. Geer then noted that the appellant was sending her an e-card with a cupid on it. Both incidents took place at the agency facility while the appellant and Geer were on duty. The appellant filed a petition for appeal of his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the AJ erred in mitigating the appellant's removal to a 30-day suspension. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In proposing and effecting the appellant's removal, the agency considered that the appellant, while employed by the Department of Agriculture, was the alleged wrongdoer in a sexual harassment suit against that agency. The government stipulated to liability in that suit, and, thus, whether the appellant committed the alleged acts was not actually litigated. <span class="Italic">Lail v. Department of Agriculture</span>, Civ. No. 5.00CV198-H (W.D.N.C. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Lail</span> to show a history of similar misconduct was improper because the appellant was never disciplined by the Department of Agriculture for any misconduct related to Lail, was not a party to the <span class="Italic">Lail</span> litigation, and never had an opportunity to defend himself against Lail's allegations. To support her finding, the AJ cited <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 335, 339-40 (1981), where the Board held that an agency may consider prior discipline as an aggravating factor in a current misconduct case if the employee was informed of the prior action in writing, the action was a matter of record, and the employee was permitted to dispute the charges before a higher level of authority than the one that imposed the discipline. The Board has repeatedly reiterated its holding in <span class="Italic">Bolling</span>. <span class="Italic">E.g., Beaudoin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 20, <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified on recons.</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 507 (2005); <span class="Italic">Holland v. Department of Defense</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 317, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (1999). The <span class="Italic">Lail</span> litigation does not meet this three-part test, and, thus, there is support for the AJ's finding that the agency improperly treated the <span class="Italic">Lail</span> lawsuit as equivalent to prior discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, under the circumstances present here, the sustained charge warrants removal. In assessing the appropriateness of the agency's penalty selection, the most important factor is the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or was frequently repeated. <span class="Italic">Gaines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 9 (2003). The Board's role is not to displace the judgment of senior agency managers who must have confidence that employees will act appropriately at all times. <span class="Italic">See Gebhardt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 49, &#x00B6; 18 (2005); <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 101, 106, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 742 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the unwelcome kissing and hugging of a female coworker is a serious act of misconduct that merits a significant penalty. <span class="Italic">See Viens v. Department of the Interior</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 23 (2002). Such conduct inherently impedes the full inclusion of female employees as professional equals in the workplace and is thus rightly of grave concern to a federal agency. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 348, 358 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, as the agency's Alternative Dispute Resolution Coordinator, the appellant, while not a supervisor, held an important position as part of the agency's management team and was responsible for resolving disputes and fostering a harmonious and productive workplace. His conduct was antithetical to the very purpose of his position and that fact supports a significant penalty. <span class="Italic">See Zazueta v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (finding that the penalty of removal is supported where an employee with significant independence and knowledge of sensitive information engages in misconduct that, by its nature, strikes at the core of his position), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 166 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Bordelon v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 400, 405 (1992) (finding that, where a position entails considerable responsibility, an agency may require that the incumbent possess the highest possible integrity); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 43, 50 (1991) (finding that conduct that was antithetical to the duties of an appellant's position supported a serious penalty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant formerly served as an Equal Employment Opportunity Specialist and had significant training and experience in equal employment opportunity rules and regulations. Thus, he should have been particularly sensitive regarding inappropriate workplace behavior. <span class="Italic">See Viens</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 17 (stating that the clarity with which an employee was on notice of the policy violated and whether he had been warned about the conduct are important considerations in assessing a penalty); <span class="Italic">Morrison</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 357 (stating that an agency properly considered the clarity with which an appellant was on notice that his conduct was unacceptable). This training, experience, and sensitivity should have been acutely heightened as a result of the <span class="Italic">Lail</span> litigation. Moreover, the litigation should have clearly and profoundly impressed upon the appellant the seriousness and the potential consequences of conduct of even a questionable sexual nature in the workplace. Despite these facts, the appellant engaged in serious misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, based on a consideration of the factors outlined above, we share the agency's concern about the appellant's judgment and rehabilitative potential. Accordingly, we find that removal was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Physical contact, forcing an employee to kiss the appellant, a supervisor, in a confined area was sufficient cause for removal, <span class="Italic">Booker v. VA,</span> 110 MSPR 72, 76-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-24, 2008 MSPB 216 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellant's Conduct Created a Hostile Work Environment Under Title VII</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed in the Outpatient Pharmacy Service of the VA Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia. The Chief of the Pharmacy Service proposed the appellant's removal on August 2, 2007, stating as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On July 27, 2007, you asked a female employee who works in your area to come into your office. You started with small talk and were holding her arms. You massaged her shoulders. You shut the door which has a combination lock and said, "what about that one across the lips." You then kissed her on the lips. The employee pushed her face away and turned her head and told you, "No." You attempted twice more to kiss her but the employee told you, "No." You then proceeded to say to her, "Have you ever been with a black guy?" She then told you to let her out of the office, "Now," as she had forgotten the lock combination. Sexual Harassment by a supervisor of another employee is a serious offense and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant made an oral but not a written reply to the proposal; a summary of the oral reply states he acknowledged that the incident occurred. At the prehearing conference on appeal, the appellant admitted engaging in the conduct as described in the proposal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The individual the appellant was charged with having sexually harassed was Christine Lanier, a Staff Pharmacist in the Outpatient Pharmacy Service. The two had worked together for many years and considered themselves friends. The appellant testified that Ms. Lanier verbally consented to one kiss before refusing others by turning her head. Ms. Lanier did not address whether the appellant made a request for "one <span id="Page_2669"></span>across the lips" but testified that he kissed her after closing behind her the door into the pharmacy, which had a combination lock. She said that when he tried to kiss her again, she turned her head and said no. Both the appellant and Ms. Lanier testified that he held her arms when he kissed her. Ms. Lanier stated that he put her arms behind his back, and "he had me kind of pinned." The appellant stated that he released her arms after she rebuffed his further attempts to kiss her, and Ms. Lanier stated that "he stepped back" at that point. The appellant testified that he opened the door when Ms. Lanier said she didn't know the combination. Ms. Lanier testified that after the appellant asked her about having been with a black man, she replied "no, have you?" and that she pushed him away and told him "you've got to let me out." Ms. Lanier testified that the incident made her feel betrayed, shocked, trapped and scared. The appellant apologized to Ms. Lanier on the first business day after the incident occurred. He testified that he was embarrassed and that the conduct was out of character for him. Nevertheless, Ms. Lanier testified that she could not work with the appellant again and had had trouble getting over the incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ held that the appellant's conduct violated the agency's policy on sexual harassment by creating a hostile work environment. She stated that the "fact that he actually physically assaulted [Lanier] by forcing a kiss upon her brings his conduct squarely under the most extremely severe category described in the policy." The AJ held that the agency had therefore proven its charge. There were no affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When taking an adverse action against an employee, an agency must establish that: (1) The charged conduct occurred, (2) a nexus exists between the conduct and the efficiency of the service, and (3) the particular penalty imposed is reasonable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B), 7513(a); <span class="Italic">Pope</span>, 114 F.3d at 1147; <span class="Italic">see Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 296-97 (1981). The agency must prove these things by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)(ii)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency charges an employee with sexual harassment in violation of Title VII, the agency is held to the same standard of proof as an individual who brings a sexual harassment case under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 68, 74 (1994), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 369, and <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 521 (1996). To establish a charge of sexual harassment under Title VII based on a hostile work environment, the agency must show that the conduct was offensive, based on the victim's sex, unwelcome, and sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with the victim's job performance or to create an abusive work environment.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The environment must be both one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive and one that was subjectively perceived as such by the victim. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 21-22 (1993); Hillen, 66 M.S.P.R. at 74. Whether an environment is hostile or abusive within the meaning of the law requires an examination of all the circumstances; no single factor is conclusive. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 510 U.S. at 23; <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant has conceded that he kissed a coworker after calling her into his office, closing the door, and holding her arms. Moreover, the AJ found Ms. Lanier's account of the details of the incident more credible than the appellant's, in large part because of Ms. Lanier's demeanor, and determined that she did not consent to be kissed. The AJ's determination that the kiss was not consensual is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">Leatherbury v. Department of the Army</span>, 524 F.3d 1293, 1304-05 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing<span class="Italic"> Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board must give deference to an AJ's credibility determination when it is based, explicitly or implicitly, on the demeanor of a witness)); <span class="Italic">see also Carosella</span>, 816 F.2d at 641 ("A determination of the credibility of the witnesses is the province of the official who heard their testimony and observed their demeanor."). In making her determination, the AJ stated that Ms. Lanier was "obviously upset and embarrassed" in recounting the incident at the hearing. The Board may overturn an AJ's credibility determinations based on observation of the demeanor of witnesses only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe,</span> 288 F.3d at 1301. There are no such reasons here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also conceded that he attempted to kiss Ms. Lanier again twice and was rebuffed and that he asked her a question about her sexual experience, before opening the locked door in his office. The evidence clearly establishes that the appellant engaged in conduct that was based on Ms. Lanier's sex and that was offensive and unwelcome. Moreover, as the AJ found, Ms. Lanier's testimony establishes that the incident created a hostile work environment for her, i.e., she subjectively perceived it as such. Therefore, whether the charge is properly sustained (i.e., whether the appellant's conduct constituted sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII) turns on whether the incident was sufficiently severe to create a hostile or abusive environment by the standard of a reasonable person. We find that it was.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An isolated incident of sexual harassment must be "extremely serious" to violate Title VII. <span class="Italic">Salazar</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 14 (citing <span class="Italic">Faragher v. City of Boca Raton</span>, 524 U.S. 775, 778 (1998)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Policy Guidance on Current Issues of Sexual Harassment (Mar. 19, 1990) (hereinafter EEOC Policy Guidance), Section (C)(2) ("a single, unusually severe incident of harassment may be sufficient to constitute a Title VII violation[.] ...&#8197;This is particularly true when the harassment is physical.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the incident herein was not sufficiently severe because it was isolated and because the agency policy indicates one incident must generally be "extremely severe (such as physical assault)." The AJ, however, correctly found that the appellant did in fact assault Ms. Lanier. Assault is defined as "the threat or use of force on another that causes that person to have a reasonable apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact;...loosely a battery." <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 109 (7th ed. 1999). Force is "[plower, violence or pressure directed against a person or thing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 656. A battery in tort law is lain intentional and offensive touching of another without lawful justification." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 146. The appellant's act in holding Ms. Lanier's arms (in her testimony, "pinning" her) and kissing her without her consent, which was to her an offensive contact or touching, therefore constituted a physical assault.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"More so than in the case of verbal advances or remarks, a single unwelcome physical advance can seriously poison the victim's working environment." <span class="Italic">EEOC Policy Guidance, supra</span>, Section (C)(2). The Board recognized this in Viens, finding a Title VII violation where a mailroom clerk grabbed a co-worker's face between his hands and kissed her twice. 88 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. In the present case, the appellant's conduct involved more physical constraint and occurred in a closed office. There can be no debate that this was an extremely serious incident by the standards of a reasonable person. As discussed above, it was an assault. Therefore, we find that the agency has borne its burden of proof to show that the appellant engaged in sexual harassment creating a hostile or abusive work environment under Title VII. The charge is therefore SUSTAINED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Removal Was a Reasonable Penalty For the Appellant's Conduct</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency proves a charge of sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment under Title VII, there is a rebuttable presumption of nexus to the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Pope</span>, 114 F.3d at 1148. An appellant may rebut the presumption by producing evidence demonstrating that his actions did not harm the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant in this case did not produce such evidence. If an individual fails to make the required showing, the agency's action should be sustained so long as the penalty imposed is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Where, as here, the charge of misconduct is fully sustained, the Board will review the agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that removal is a reasonable penalty in cases of sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Batts v. Department of the Interior</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 27, &#x00B6; 15 (2006); <span class="Italic">Viens</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 23. This is particularly true where the conduct involved is physical; "[t]he unwelcome kissing and hugging of a female coworker is a serious act of misconduct that merits a significant penalty." <span class="Italic">Batts</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 27, &#x00B6; 12. Physical contact in a sexual harassment case is an aggravating factor that may be relied on to enhance the penalty. <span class="Italic">Devall v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 8 (1999), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 250 F.3d 756 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table); <span class="Italic">Woodford v. Department of the Army</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 350, 357 (1997); <span class="Italic">Pugh v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 326, 327 (1984). It is also appropriate to hold a supervisor to a higher standard of conduct in a sexual harassment case, given his responsibility to ensure an environment free of such discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cisneros v. Department of Defense</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 19 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 243 F.3d 562 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table); <span class="Italic">Alsedek</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 242.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on PFR that the penalty of removal was too severe. In support of this argument, he asserts that there is no evidence that he might engage in such conduct again and cites his lengthy, unmarred service record.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The appellant had 17 years of federal civilian service, with no prior discipline. The appellant also points to his prompt apology and argues that the AJ incorrectly concluded, in determining his credibility, that he tried to minimize his actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official in this case testified that in choosing the penalty he considered all the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. He stated that his decision was based on the nature of the offense and its impact on the workplace, as well as the fact that the appellant was a supervisor and thus subject to higher standards of trust and responsibility. Mr. Phaup also emphasized that the behavior involved inappropriate touching. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. He acknowledged that the appellant had no prior disciplinary action and a good work record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official also testified that he was concerned about the potential for the appellant to engage in similar behavior again if returned to the workplace. He did not identify the basis for this concern and acknowledged that the appellant did not deny that the incident at <span id="Page_2670"></span>issue occurred. The AJ stated she shared Mr. Phaup's concern because of "the appellant's inability to understand the magnitude of his actions, and their inevitable effect on Lanier." As noted above, the appellant has challenged this conclusion on PFR. Regardless of whether there was a basis for this concern, however, the penalty was reasonable based on the other relevant factors considered, i.e., the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, which included physical contact, and the appellant's status as a supervisor. In addition, the record shows that the appellant had training three times on the prevention of sexual harassment, in 2004, 2005 and 2006, indicating the importance the agency placed on ensuring that such conduct did not occur in the workplace. Therefore, the appellant "knew or should have known that such behavior was unacceptable and would not be tolerated by the agency." <span class="Italic">Devall</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. at 437. The clarity with which an employee was on notice of the rules prohibiting his misconduct is an appropriate consideration in determining a penalty. <span class="Italic">Batts</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 27, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Viens</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 17 (citing <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find the agency's decision to remove the appellant from federal employment was within the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Batts</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 27, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Viens</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 23; <span class="Italic">cf. Woodford</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. at 358 (demotion to a non-supervisory position was the maximum reasonable penalty for an incident of sexual harassment where an agency policy was violated and a hostile work environment was not found).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A supervisor responsible for offensive touchings was properly suspended for 45 days as a result of violations of internal agency policies prohibiting sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Vakili v. USDA</span>, 35 MSPR 534, 539 (1987) (physical contact as an aggravating factor); <span class="Italic">see</span> Addo v. Dept. of Air Force, DC-0752-16-0427-I-1 (NP 5/4/2022) (removal of supervisor mitigated to demotion to a nonsupervisory position and a 30-day suspension: "appellant was meeting with a female subordinate and another employee about what he believed was disrespectful conduct by the subordinate when, at the end of the meeting, the appellant asked the subordinate for a hug, and when she refused his request, he ordered her to hug him. When she refused his order, the appellant grabbed the subordinate by the arms and attempted to pull her to a standing position from a chair."); <span class="Italic">Adkins v. Dept. of Defense</span>, SF-0752-16-0294-I-1 (NP 12/12/2016) ("We find that the appellant should have known that his conduct, which included at least three instances of inappropriate physical contact and several other instances of inappropriate comments and sexually suggestive gestures, was inappropriate and did not require any preliminary warning prior to the issuance of the proposed removal notice."); <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 68, 97 (1994) (charge of inappropriate touching: that the appellant occupied a high-level position in the agency in a woman's chain of command and was in a position to influence her career exacerbated the hostility of her environment and would have been an exacerbating factor for a reasonable person). A supervisor received a 90-day suspension for an incident involving a touching. The suspension was imposed in lieu of a demotion because of a long record of past good service and because the incident was an isolated one. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 225, 232-33 (1990); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Soltero v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board views physical contact as actionable under a sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct analysis, "an adverse action based on a purely accidental touching would not be 'for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,' as required by 5 USC 7513(a)." <span class="Italic">Davis v.
