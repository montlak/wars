<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-62"><span class="space">h.</span> Intolerable Working Conditions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">When intolerable working conditions are alleged, the courts and the Board find an action involuntary and within the Board's jurisdiction only if the employee demonstrates that the employer engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in that employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">McCorcle v. USDA</span>, 98 MSPR 363, 370 &#x00B6; 11 (2005) (no jurisdiction; the appellant accepted a directed reassignment until an intervening medical condition prevented his relocation; the appellant informed an agency official that he was retiring because he exhausted his sick leave and was facing performance charges and financial pressures). The appellant must show "that a reasonable person would have felt that there was a causal connection between all of the circumstances, including those incidents that were remote in time, and his retirement." <span class="Italic">Ogo v. USPS</span>, DE-0752-12-0415-I-1 (NP 7/22/2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 310, 320 &#x00B6; 26 (2000)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations were sufficient to warrant a hearing on an involuntary retirement appeal based on assertions of intolerable working conditions in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 244, 247 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Specifically, appellant alleged that the agency engaged in a course of coercive conduct which was humiliating, arbitrary and willful, including: (1) his illegal reassignment; (2) the wrongful and punitive ejectment of appellant from his office; (3) the issuance of two letters of warning to appellant without good cause; (4) the intentional publication by the agency of one of the letters of warning; and (5) the repeated, arbitrary denial of appellant's requests for sick and/or annual leave. Appellant further alleged that the agency's actions were intended to destroy his career with the Postal Service, as well as his mental well-being, and precipitated his premature and involuntary retirement. We find that appellant's contentions were sufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that his retirement was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his decision dismissing appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the administrative judge identified the controlling issue as "whether appellant ha[d] established by preponderant evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal." However, because appellant had requested a hearing, the administrative judge should have made a determination regarding whether appellant had presented sufficient allegations of fact in support of his contention that his retirement was involuntary to warrant a hearing on that issue. <span class="Italic">See Spiegel v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 MSPB 307, 2 MSPR 140, 142 (1980). We find that appellant's submissions cast sufficient doubt upon the presumption of the voluntariness of his retirement to require a hearing on that issue<span class="Italic">. See Eikenberry v. Department of the Interior,</span> 20 MSPR 478, 479 (1984) (employee who presented non-frivolous argument based on more than mere conclusory allegations that his reassignment was coerced was entitled to a hearing on those allegations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations concerning agency coercion must be specific, <span class="Italic">Tengeres v. USPS,</span> DA-0752-09-0709-I-1 (NP 12/10/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the administrative judge failed to consider his amended appeal, which alleged that the agency would have forced the appellant to violate the law had he not retired. The administrative judge did, however, consider the amended appeal and we agree with her conclusion that the appellant's broad, conclusory allegations did not constitute nonfrivolous allegations that he was subjected to intolerable working conditions such that a reasonable person would be forced to retire. <span class="Italic">See Dorrall v. Department of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (nonfrivolous allegations must be supported on the written record by more than unsubstantiated speculation in a pleading), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of intolerable working conditions, and an involuntary retirement claim, were insufficiently specific to require a hearing in <span class="Italic">Sayre v. EPA</span>, DC-0752-16-0036-I-1 (NP 11/2/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, effective August 11, 2013, the appellant was reassigned, with no loss in grade or pay, from a GS-15, step 10 Biologist position with the agency's Risk Assessment Division's Immediate Office to another GS-15, step 10 Biologist position with the agency's New Chemicals Screening and Assessment Branch. More than 16 months later, effective December 31, 2014, the appellant retired under the agency's Voluntary Separation Incentive Program and received a separation incentive payment. On October 12, 2015, he filed the instant appeal challenging his reassignment as a constructive demotion and his retirement as involuntary based on intolerable working conditions. He also alleged that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his age.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that his supervisors oversaw a reorganization in which several older employees were reassigned and then subjected "to utterly intolerable work conditions" and that his "ultimate decision to retire was proximately influenced by the initial illegitimate constructive demotion and intervening intolerable work conditions." Outside of his conclusory statement that the reassigned older employees were required to perform duties and accept responsibilities not commensurate with their pay and grade, there is no indication as to why he believes that his working conditions were intolerable. The appellant's allegations regarding his involuntary retirement claim are conclusory because he does not describe what duties he was forced to perform that he believes were intolerable or what other actions the agency took that made his work environment intolerable. His <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations are insufficient to obtain Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2016), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 679 F. App'x 1006 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's allegations of discrimination and other violations of law only insofar as those allegations relate to the issue of the voluntariness of his retirement. <span class="Italic">Vitale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 20 (2007); <span class="Italic">see Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 695 (1996). Again, we find his allegations of discrimination to be <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> in nature. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8. Similarly, <span id="Page_2006"></span>though he asserted that his supervisors violated the law by assigning him "less-than-grade-appropriate assignment[s]," such an allegation is conclusory and, even if true, we find would be insufficient to establish that his retirement was involuntary, <span class="Italic">see Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (explaining that unpleasant working conditions or dissatisfaction with work assignments generally will not be so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F. App'x 852 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Moreover, though he served in his reassignment for over 16 months, he did not allege that he attempted to exhaust his remedial avenues. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. Nor did he allege that he was under any sort of time pressure to resign when he did. <span class="Italic">See Holser v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 92, 95-96 (1997). Because he could have remained in his position and contested the validity of the agency's actions but chose not to, we find that he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that his resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">cf. Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 513, 523 (1995) (finding an involuntary resignation after the appellant offered overwhelming evidence supporting an intolerable working environment and did not resign until she pursued many grievances and two complaints, receiving an adverse decision on her grievances just prior to her resignation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Markon v. Dept. of State</span>, 71 MSPR 574, 580-83 (1996), determined that a constructive forced retirement claim was sufficiently well pleaded to require a hearing when the appellant asserted that she retired after: significant duties were removed; she was harassed by her supervisor and a junior employee favored by the supervisor; she was not given performance standards or an appraisal; she was portrayed in a bad light to her peers; and she was unfavorably treated as to use of compensatory time:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant had not established even a nonfrivolous allegation that her retirement was coerced and that she was constructively discharged, the administrative judge noted several of the appellant's contentions; namely, important duties were removed from her position, her supervisor treated her adversely regarding compensatory time use, her supervisor treated another, allegedly more junior secretary, more favorably than the appellant and was consistently rude and intolerant of the appellant, and there was no position to which the appellant could be reassigned. The administrative judge then made factual findings regarding these matters, relying largely upon evidence submitted by the appellant and concluded that, even if proven, a nonfrivolous allegation is not established.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the administrative judge did not consider the combined effect of the totality of the appellant's allegations as raised in the appeal. In this regard, the appellant's contentions are numerous, fact specific, and go beyond what the administrative judge construed. Nor is there any mention in the initial decision of any of the appellant's contentions regarding less favorable treatment accorded her based upon age, sex, or religious discrimination, and/or retaliation for EEO activities and whistleblowing. As detailed below, we find that the appellant has established a nonfrivolous allegation that her retirement was coerced in that a reasonable person in her situation might have felt compelled to retire and she, therefore, is entitled to a hearing on her claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Taylor</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 193 (the appellant alleged specific acts of discrimination and harassment on the part of agency officials entitling her to a hearing on the issue of the involuntariness of her resignation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we cite examples of the appellant's claims that support our finding of a nonfrivolous allegation of a constructive discharge; these are illustrative only and are not intended as a complete summary of all of the evidence of record on this matter. In her appeal, the appellant alleged that upon taking the Secretarial position in March 1993, her supervisor, the Office Director, took duties of the position away from her and gave them to a younger woman in a lower-graded position who was of the same religion as he, and that discrimination on the bases of sex, religion and age, as well as reprisal, led her to retire earlier than she desired. Further, she allegedly was not provided with performance standards, never counseled as to her performance, never provided interim evaluations, and never given a performance appraisal. Also, the appellant alleged she was harassed by the younger, lower-graded secretary, with the concurrence of their supervisor, and harassed also by her supervisor, who berated her and showed favoritism to the younger employee, including taking that younger employee on an agency trip to Israel. Additionally, the appellant alleged that because her supervisor believed that she may have reported irregularities in the use of compensatory time in the office to the Inspector General, his and the younger employee's harassment of her "intensified," leaving her with no choice but to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an affidavit, submitted in response to the administrative judge's order to show cause on jurisdiction, the appellant asserts, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that her supervisor "snarled" "yelled" or "screamed" at her, without substantive reason to do so. Again, she asserts that he by-passed her and dealt with the junior secretary, in an effort to undercut her authority. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at paras. 11 (in connection with an off-site meeting in the summer of 1993); 12 (in connection with duties the junior secretary refused to perform at the appellant's request, although the appellant was in a position to require her to perform them); 14 (in connection with mail and paperwork distribution); and 17 (in connection with hiring the appellant's predecessor, after the appellant had announced she was retiring). Further, the appellant asserts that the younger, junior secretary was given her duties to perform and the circumstances constituted discrimination, harassment and retaliation. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., paras. 11 (planning the off-site meeting); 14 (the appellant was blamed for any problems, although the junior secretary performed what formerly were the appellant's duties); 19 (general allegations that the appellant could not get back duties and responsibilities that the junior secretary took from her because her supervisor would not support her in this endeavor); and 22 (at a meeting to discuss her duties, the junior secretary was favorably treated, stated that she performed most of the appellant's duties, and it remained unclear to the appellant what her duties were). Also, the junior secretary was, according to the appellant, treated more favorably regarding her use of compensatory time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that she had no choice but to retire because there were no other jobs available to her and she could not endure the day-to-day rude and unfavorable treatment she received both from the Office Director, and with his concurrence, from the junior secretary. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> paras. 6 and 10 (remarks about the appellant's age), 7 (the junior secretary was setting her up to fail), and 9 (the junior secretary yelled at her and painted her in a bad light to her co-workers and to their supervisor at every opportunity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is some support for the appellant's claims that the Office Director made her working conditions intolerable and that her retirement appeared to be the only option, other than continuing to work for the Office Director. <span class="Italic">See</span> Affidavit of Janet Litzenberger, now retired, who performed Personnel Specialist duties, although her official title was Management Analyst. Ms. Litzenberger relates, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant visited her on several occasions to discuss her unpleasant working conditions, and her claim that her duties and responsibilities had been taken away from her. She states that her office had not received "work requirements" for certain employees, including the appellant, from the appellant's Office Director. Further, she states that one of the appellant's supervisor's previous secretaries had had problems and resigned. Ms. Litzenberger avers that while she herself did not observe the Office Director screaming at the appellant, she "was told by an officer in [the Office Director's Office] that [the Director] was treating Ms. Markon very unfairly, and that Ms. Markon did not deserve that kind of treatment." Ms. Litzenberger opined that the appellant could not have remained longer in the office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While, as we have noted, the above discussion is illustrative only, and not necessarily a complete recitation of all specific allegations, supporting incidents, facts, and record evidence, it is sufficient to show that the appellant has met her burden of establishing a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of intolerable working conditions were insufficient to find a retirement constructively adverse in <span class="Italic">Hardmon v. VA</span>, AT-0752-17-0589-I-1 (NP 1/27/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that a Federal employee is not guaranteed a stress-free working environment free from difficulties and unpleasantness. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000). Regarding the appellant's contention that her supervisor stated she "belonged" to him, the Board has held that an employee's perception that she was subjected to slights by a supervisor does not render her working environment intolerable. <span class="Italic">See Loredo v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 686, &#x00B6; 8 (2012) (finding that her supervisor's religious slurs did not render the appellant's working conditions intolerable). The Board also has held that feelings of being unfairly criticized at work do not render a workplace so intolerable that a reasonable person would be compelled to separate from the agency. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32. Thus, the appellant's claims that she was falsely accused of inappropriate conduct does not render her decision to retire involuntary. Likewise, the Board has held that the fact that an employee faced the unpleasant alternatives between retiring and opposing a potential removal did not render the retirement involuntary. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Department of the Navy</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 6 (2015). Thus, the appellant's unpleasant alternatives between retiring or contesting the 14-day suspension do not render her retirement involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A combination of adverse circumstances and personnel actions over time warranted a hearing to resolve jurisdiction over an appeal from a forced retirement in <span class="Italic">Agee-Long v. GSA</span>, SF-0752-17-0518-I-1 (NP 1/20/2023), requiring consideration of the totality of circumstances examined under an objective standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant elects to pursue a chapter 75 action as to her alleged involuntary retirement, the administrative judge should hold the appellant's requested hearing on the issue of jurisdiction. The administrative judge found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's alleged involuntary retirement because her claims that the agency's actions <span id="Page_2007"></span>were unjustified were not supported by the record. Further, he concluded that the evidence suggested that she was considering retirement for some time. We find that the administrative judge improperly weighed the evidence at the jurisdictional stage without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A retirement is presumed to be voluntary and outside of the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Putnam v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 21 (2014). An involuntary retirement, however, is equivalent to a forced removal within the Board's jurisdiction under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The touchstone of the voluntariness analysis and the common element in all Board cases involving alleged involuntary resignations or retirements is that factors have operated on the employee's decision-making processes that deprived her of freedom of choice. <span class="Italic">Coufal v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 22 (2004). The totality of the circumstances is examined under an objective standard to determine voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under that standard, the Board will find a retirement or resignation involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that under all the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an alleged involuntary retirement if she makes a nonfrivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 23. A nonfrivolous allegation is an allegation of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, to establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant need not allege facts that, if proven, definitely would establish that the retirement was involuntary; she need only allege facts that, if proven, could establish such a claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, allegations of discrimination and reprisal for whistleblowing activity are alleged, such evidence may be addressed at the jurisdictional stage only insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness and not whether the evidence would establish discrimination or reprisal as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 24. Thus, evidence of discrimination and reprisal goes to the ultimate question of coercion.[4] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;If the administrative judge determines that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's adverse action appeal, her appeal will not be subject to the jurisdictional requirements of an IRA appeal, and the administrative judge should adjudicate the appellant's claims of discrimination and reprisal for protected activity and disclosures as affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">See Corthell</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 17 (providing that if, on remand, an appellant made a knowing and an informed election of pursuing a chapter 75 alleged involuntary retirement appeal, the adverse action appeal would not be subject to the jurisdictional requirements of an IRA appeal or limited to the issues listed at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a)); <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 22 (explaining that if an appellant proved that she suffered a constructive suspension on remand, the administrative judge should consider whether the suspension was taken in retaliation for whistleblowing activity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling her to a hearing, an administrative judge may consider an agency's documentary submissions. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). But, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant alleges that she suffered a hostile work environment beginning in November 2015 and ending with her retirement approximately 2 years later. She submitted her sworn EEO investigative affidavit, which attests to the facts underlying her claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s) (indicating that an allegation generally will be considered nonfrivolous when it is made under oath or penalty of perjury, is more than conclusory, is plausible on its face, and is material to the legal issues in the appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal involves a number of actions that the appellant alleged created a hostile work environment and forced her to retire. A combination of workplace actions, such as a PIP, a diminished performance appraisal, and workplace isolation, may be sufficient to meet the nonfrivolous pleading standard. <span class="Italic">Coufal</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-27. Here, the appellant alleged that the agency took a number of punitive actions for 2 years that culminated in her perception that she had no choice but to retire. In sum, during this period, she alleges that the agency issued her a letter of warning, two reprimands, and a suspension; placed her on a sick leave abuse plan; denied her a WIGI, placed her on a PIP with unreasonable work assignments, and rated her as unacceptable on her mid-year and end-of-year evaluations; and revoked her telework privileges, denied her training, and required her to submit medical documentation that it already had to support her reasonable accommodation request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered and discounted a number of the appellant's allegations as not substantiated by the record. For example, he found that the agency's October 31, 2016 response to the appellant's reasonable accommodation request was "detailed and thoughtful," and the agency "reasonably required more medical documentation to address very valid concerns." However, in doing so, he did not consider the appellant's statement in her affidavit that she had already submitted sufficient medical information, and that the agency's mistreatment caused her medical condition to worsen such that she could no longer work. <span class="Italic">See Rosario-Fabregas v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2015) (discussing those circumstance in which an agency may request medical information under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2002) (finding that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that the agency's actions caused his medical condition to worsen, resulting in his retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making his jurisdictional finding, the administrative judge considered evidence submitted by the agency that the appellant began inquiring about her retirement options as early as the end of September 2016, and expressed her satisfaction with her retirement decision a couple months later. We agree that the timing of the appellant's retirement and her statements concerning that retirement are relevant considerations in the voluntariness determination. <span class="Italic">E.g., Terban v. Department of Ene</span>rgy, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (agreeing with the Board's decision to give greater weight to events that occurred closer to an employee's alleged involuntary retirement). Nonetheless, in finding this evidence more persuasive than the appellant's affidavit attesting to her alleged coerced retirement, the administrative judge impermissibly weighed the evidence without holding a jurisdictional hearing to resolve the parties' conflicting assertions regarding the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6; 9 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, as alleged, a reasonable person in the appellant's position could have felt that the agency's actions left her no choice but to retire. Because the appellant disputes the agency's evidence, resolution of this issue requires that the administrative judge hold a hearing to weigh the evidence and resolve the conflicting factual assertions. <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 330 (remanding for a hearing because the appellant disputed the agency's evidence and his allegations, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of Board jurisdiction). Thus, the administrative judge should hold a jurisdictional hearing if the appellant chooses to elect her chapter 75 remedy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, on remand, the administrative judge should rule on the appellant's request to extend the period to initiate discovery. The appellant filed a timely request to extend this deadline. The administrative judge did not rule on that request below. The appellant is entitled to request discovery of relevant materials to assist her in meeting her burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Russo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 8 (1999). On remand, the administrative judge should determine whether the appellant still wishes to engage in the discovery process and set appropriate deadlines.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the passage of time between alleged harassment and a retirement may negate an allegation of involuntariness, <span class="Italic">Redmond v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-15-0578-B-1 (NP 4/4/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In reviewing the time pressure to make a decision about whether to retire as a factor under Board law, the administrative judge correctly considered the fact that the Chief of Staff only supervised the appellant for 90 days and that she did not retire until a year later, after he was no longer her supervisor. Although the appellant argues that the length of time is not a determinative factor in a hostile work environment, we agree with the administrative judge that both the duration of the alleged harassment and the length of time from when the harassment ended and the appellant's retirement are relevant to determining whether a reasonable person would be compelled to retire. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Department of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (observing that "a long period of time between the alleged coercive act and the employee's retirement diminishes the causal link between these two events and, thus, attenuates the employee's claim of involuntariness[ ]").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may be expected to use available means to challenge onerous work conditions before retiring and challenging the retirement as constructively adverse. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ,</span> DC-0752-11-0172-I-1 (NP 9/6/2011), involving an allegedly forced retirement, summarized decisions challenging resignations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the appellant's submissions both below and on petition for review, and we find that he has alleged facts that, if proven, could show that his retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. In particular, the appellant has alleged facts that could show that the agency deliberately took actions to harass him and make his working environment unpleasant with the intention of pushing him into retirement. However, he has not alleged facts that could show that "factors have operated on [his] decision-making processes that deprived him...of freedom of choice." <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 513, 519 (1995). The question is not what the agency's <span id="Page_2008"></span>intention was in creating difficult or unpleasant working conditions for the appellant but whether the appellant was able to exercise free choice under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983). It is an objective standard. <span class="Italic">Levy v.

Jones v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6; 16 (2007), and even if the appellant was apprehensive of further discipline for not being able to follow his supervisors' allegedly contradictory instructions, he still had the option of contesting an action that he believed to be invalid if and when it did occur, <span class="Italic">see Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish that his retirement was involuntary due to intolerable working conditions, the appellant must not only show that his "retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency," but also that that he "had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire." <span class="Italic">Shoaf v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the second scenario, we note that, in cases where intolerable working conditions are alleged, both the courts and the Board will find an action involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that the employer or agency engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in that employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 577-78 (1996). Having reviewed the evidence and considering the totality of the circumstances, we do not believe that the appellant has met his jurisdictional burden. We acknowledge that the appellant's work environment between August 2007 and his October 31, 2008 retirement was not pleasant, at least from his perspective. Indeed, he received lower--albeit a fully successful--evaluation, two disciplinary actions and increased reporting requirements. However, he has not demonstrated that the working conditions were so intolerable that he was coerced to retire. We agree with the administrative judge that the agency had ample evidence to sustain two of the charges described in the notice of proposed removal, which was mitigated to a 60-day suspension, the appellant was aware of the suspension prior to his retirement, and the agency had sufficient evidence to support the prior discipline against him (the proposed 5-day suspension). Moreover, the appellant's claims of age discrimination and reprisal were not persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although the proposed action was a removal, the appellant was aware approximately a week before his retirement that the agency had decided to impose a 60-day suspension rather than a removal. This fact weighs heavily against the appellant's claim of involuntariness based on the proposed removal action.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">It may be difficult to demonstrate that job dissatisfactions rise to the level of coercion equating to an involuntary retirement. <span class="Italic">Hall v. MSPB</span>, 342 Fed. Appx. 603, 605-06 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), illustrates the high burden of proof:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Doris Hall was employed as a human resources specialist with the Transportation Security Administration in Arlington, Virginia. In January 2005, Hall had a meeting with her supervisor, Deborah Grade, and her team leader, Andrea McKinney, to discuss her career goals. At that meeting, Hall expressed the option of retirement in the coming year. In her words: "I explained that I was 61 years old and would be turning 62 years of age and would explore the possibility of retirement as my goal." As a result of the meeting, Grade instructed McKinney to review Hall's employment file to assess her retirement options.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Hall, from that moment onwards Grade improperly used Hall's interest "as a means to harass" her into retirement in order to replace her with a younger employee. In support of this claim, Hall alleges that she was frequently omitted from assignment lists for training and given simple assignments which she found demeaning and detrimental to her health. Hall also relies on an incident where she attended a training session and was dismissed upon voicing her opinion that the session was unhelpful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October 2005, Hall alleges that she attended another meeting with Grade and McKinney where Grade stated: "If you don't retire, I'm going to terminate you. If I have time, I'll look for an Assistant's job for you." Later that month, Hall submitted a voluntary retirement notice indicating that her effective date of retirement would be November 30, 2005. As further evidence to support her discrimination claim, Hall highlights that she was not given "the usual office wide retirement celebration." Shortly after the effective date of her retirement, Hall filed a formal complaint of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The complaint was remanded to her employing agency who ultimately found no evidence of age discrimination. Hall then appealed the decision to the Board who dismissed Hall's claim for lack of jurisdiction without granting an evidentiary hearing. Hall timely appealed to this court under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of our review from a Board appeal is limited. This court must affirm unless the Board's decision was "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or <span id="Page_2009"></span>unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">Chase-Baker v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 198 F.3d 843, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1999). This court also reviews the Board's jurisdiction without deference. <span class="Italic">Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because a decision to resign or retire is presumed to be voluntary, an employee who voluntarily resigns or retires has no right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Where the resignation or retirement was "involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal," however, the Board possesses jurisdiction over the appeal. To establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion we have required an employee to show that: (1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire; and (3) the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006). This court notes that "the doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one" requiring that the employee "satisfy a demanding legal standard." <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The test for involuntariness is objective. An employee must "establish that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstances would feel coerced into resigning." <span class="Italic">Middleton v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 185 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). "[A] hearing is required with respect to jurisdictional questions only if the employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that, if proved, would establish Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1125.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Staats</span>, we explained that the doctrine of coercive involuntariness "does not apply to a case in which an employee decides to resign or retire because he does not want to accept a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1124. Presenting an employee with "an unpleasant situation" or "two unattractive options" does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Christie v. United States</span>, 207 Ct. Cl. 333, 518 F.2d 584, 587 (1975) ("[W]hile it is possible plaintiff, herself, perceived no viable alternative but to tender her resignation, the record evidence supports CSC's finding that plaintiff chose to resign and accept discontinued service retirement rather than challenge the validity of her proposed discharge for cause. The fact remains, plaintiff had a choice. She could stand pat and fight. She chose not to.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This record does not show any non-frivolous allegations that rise to the level of coercive involuntariness. Thus, Hall showed no entitlement to an evidentiary hearing with respect to jurisdiction. It was Hall--not Grade or McKinney--who first brought up the possibility of retirement in the meeting where her career goals were discussed. It was Hall--not the agency--who set the date of her retirement. The vast majority of Hall's alleged discriminatory actions amount to nothing more than speculation. Her claims that she was treated unfairly by being precluded from attending training sessions, by being given "demeaning" job tasks, and by not receiving "the usual office wide retirement celebration" are the exact type of contentions we have previously held are not actionable under the doctrine of coercive involuntariness. Even Grade's alleged statement that she would terminate Hall if she refused to retire, when viewed in light of the entire record, does not save Hall's claim. Grade's statement was itself immediately qualified with, "[i]f I have time, I'll look for an Assistant's job for you." Hall has alleged no supporting facts beyond this isolated exchanged. Nor has she alleged that an appointment to an assistant's position would be beyond the agency's scope of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the record shows that Hall's retirement was not forced or coerced, as those terms are used in this context. Instead, when the totality of the circumstances are considered, we agree with the administrative judge that Hall's proffer failed to provide the basis for a non-frivolous involuntary-resignation claim. We therefore affirm the Board's decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency coerced her retirement. An employee is not guaranteed a stress-free working environment. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000).

Considering the totality of the circumstances, we find that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency had denied her any realistic choice but to retire. Nothing in the record suggests that the agency was forcing the appellant to make any type of decision in August 2000 and her decision to retire at that time appears to have been entirely self-initiated. At the time she retired, she was pursuing her discrimination complaints through the EEO process, and the record does not reflect that her complaints were not being properly considered in that context. <span class="Italic">See Axsom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 17 (2009). Further, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs was evidently providing her further opportunity to support her claims for benefits. Although the appellant claims to have been apprehensive of the agency taking a disciplinary action against her at the time she stopped reporting to work, she has not alleged that the agency had even proposed such an action at the time she retired a year later. Instead of retiring based on her speculation that such an action might occur in the future, the appellant clearly had an option of contesting an action she thought was invalid if and when it did occur. <span class="Italic">See Axsom</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">see also Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (a resignation is not involuntary if the employee had a choice of whether to resign or contest the validity of the agency action). The appellant has failed to allege that any event occurred relatively close in time to her retirement that could have given a reasonable employee no choice but to retire. Even viewed in light of her claims of a continuing pattern of harassment dating back many years, the events that the appellant describes as having occurred in 1999 and 2000 could not, if proven, rise to the level of coercion necessary to overcome the presumption that her retirement was voluntary. <span class="Italic">See Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1025.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's medical evidence regarding the conditions she asserts were caused by her hostile and discriminatory working environment. The appellant asserted below that the Board has jurisdiction over this matter because she is disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the agency denied her request for a reasonable accommodation. The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's claim of disability discrimination absent an otherwise appealable action. <span class="Italic">See Carey v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 106, &#x00B6; 5 (2009); <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Nevertheless, an agency's denial of a reasonable accommodation to an eligible employee is a factor to be considered in determining whether the agency coerced the appellant's resignation or retirement. <span class="Italic">See Carey</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 106, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has alleged in general terms that the agency denied her request for light duty that would have enabled her to continue working. The record reflects that the appellant requested a light duty assignment "away from the supervisory stressful environment" in March 1997, which the agency denied. The appellant nevertheless continued to work for almost 21/2 years after the agency denied her request, indicating that the appellant had the option of continuing to work following the denial of that request. <span class="Italic">See Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1024-25; <span class="Italic">Searcy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 13. At the time the appellant retired, she had been away from the alleged intolerable working environment for about a year. <span class="Italic">See Axsom</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 16. There is no indication in the record that the appellant had made a new request for accommodation or indicated that she wished to return to work before she decided to retire in August 2000. To the contrary, the records the appellant has submitted, particularly the contemporaneous reports prepared by the appellant's psychologist, unequivocally show that the appellant and her psychologist believed that she could not work under any circumstances at the time she decided to retire. Even if the appellant genuinely felt that she had no alternative but to retire, in part due to her medical conditions, the appellant has failed to make a sufficient allegation of a coercive or improper act on the part of the agency that could have left a reasonable person in her position with no other choice but to resign in August 2000. <span class="Italic">See Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124 (the narrow doctrine of coercive involuntariness applies when a decision to retire "was the result of improper acts by the agency" and not merely when an employee retires because "he does not want to accept [actions] that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave"); <span class="Italic">Vitale</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 26 (although an agency official may have caused the appellant apprehension and exacerbation of his medical ailments, he failed to establish that his working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to retire).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Brown v. MSPB</span>, 469 Fed. Appx. 852, 855-56 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court agrees with the Board that Brown has failed to allege any facts which, if proven, could establish the Board's jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that her retirement was involuntary. As to the first two elements of the involuntary retirement test, Brown fails to allege that the Agency "effectively imposed the terms of [her]...retirement" or that she "had no realistic alternative but to...retire." <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span> 437 F.3d at 1329. The alleged impossible productivity goals, groundless criticism, and desk throwing incident, however unpleasant or hostile they may have been, did not compel Brown's retirement on this record. Indeed, Brown did not retire, but rather continued to work during the nine-year span of alleged hostility and discrimination, and the two and a half year period after the Agency denied her light duty request. <span class="Italic">See Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1024-25. <span id="Page_2010"></span>In her brief to this court, Brown stated that she "loved her job and she had planned to work five (5) years longer" but "[she] did not enjoy the fact that she was forced to help her employees work and also, perform her supervisory duties." Although the circumstances of her position may not have been as enjoyable as she had wished, "it is well-established that the mere fact that an employee is faced with an inherently unpleasant situation or that his choices are limited to unpleasant alternatives does not make his decision involuntary." <span class="Italic">Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1023.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the third prong of the involuntary retirement test, Brown fails to allege that her retirement was the "result of improper acts by the [A]gency" with respect to the Agency's denial of her light duty request. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329. Brown fails to allege that she was actually entitled to a light duty assignment. Brown cites to a letter from her psychiatrist, addressed to "Whom it May Concern" dated January 27, 1997, which states that Brown was being treated "for her emotional problems of anxiety and stress...which were caused by her treatment while working at her job at the [Agency]," but there is no evidence that Brown's supervisors saw this letter or, assuming they had, would have been required to assign Brown to light duty. Brown's actual diagnosis of chronic stress causing her to be unable to perform the functions of her job was not until May 2000, after she left work, and thus does not support her allegation that the agency forced her to resign by denying her light duty. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. (1997) ("Evidence of the appellant's medical conditions after his resignation is irrelevant to the voluntariness of his resignation.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Brown's May 2000 psychiatric report indicates that her chronic stress condition caused her to lose consciousness at work, but nothing in the record indicates that the agency knew of the seriousness of her chronic stress disorder until after the August 1999 incident, or did anything wrongful to make her working environment intolerable given her condition. Brown's subjective feeling that she was being treated unfairly, and the resulting stress from those feelings, without more, is not enough to establish involuntary retirement. Moreover, as the Board noted in its decision, "[t]here is no indication in the record that [Brown] had made a new request for accommodation or indicated that she wished to return to work before she decided to retire in August 2000." "In sum, it is not reasonably possible to characterize [Brown's] resignation as the embodiment of h[er] involuntary acceptance of terms dictated by h[er] employer." <span class="Italic">Pitt v. United States</span>, 420 F.2d 1028, 1033 (Ct. Cl. 1970).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, this court finds no basis to overturn the Board's determination that Brown failed to make a non-frivolous allegation establishing a claim of involuntary retirement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that he had no other option but to retire because: (1) the Budget Officer with whom he had to coordinate to perform his job duties discriminated and retaliated against him by unjustifiably criticizing his work product and chastising him; (2) agency management supported the Budget Officer, which meant he constantly had to defend himself and his performance; (3) the agency retaliated against him by removing some of his job duties and refusing to let him perform his duties as he had previously performed them; (4) he experienced "substantial distress and health problems," which he did not describe, as a result of the discrimination and retaliation; and (5) agency management denied his numerous requests for a transfer out of the office. While the appellant has alleged difficult and unpleasant working conditions, considering the totality of the circumstances, the appellant has failed to allege facts that, if true, could show that his working conditions were so difficult or so unpleasant that he had no other option but to retire. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign); <span class="Italic">see also Baldwin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant additionally argued that his working conditions were intolerable. To establish intolerable working conditions, an appellant must show that, under the totality of the circumstances, his working conditions were made so difficult that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Brown v.

This is a difficult standard to meet. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant argued that his supervisor micromanaged him and, by demoting him, placed him in the untenable situation of working side-by-side with employees he once supervised. He further argues that, because the demotion action lacked merit and was taken in violation of his due process rights, he lost faith that his working conditions would ever be tolerable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> He admitted, however, that the events he characterizes as micromanagement ended 3 months before his retirement, which diminishes their causative value. <span class="Italic">See also Terban v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions generally are not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign. <span class="Italic">Miller v.

As the administrative judge pointed out, one of the appellant's witnesses allegedly received similar treatment, but did not resign or retire. As for the appellant's concern that he would be working as a peer with employees he had once supervised, he has not shown how this would be intolerable. He has not, for example, alleged that these employees might retaliate against him for past supervisory actions. The fact that the appellant may have been faced with an inherently unpleasant situation, or that his choices may have been limited to unpleasant alternatives, did not render his decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Lawson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant alleges that the agency took actions that made her working conditions so intolerable that she was driven to an involuntary resignation or retirement, the Board will find her retirement involuntary only if she demonstrates that the agency engaged in a course of action that made her working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to retire. <span class="Italic">Vitale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 20 (2007). On review, the appellant argues that she had no choice but to retire because she could not continue working for her same supervisors after the way they had treated her and could not trust them to give her "a reasonable chance of working out the [LCA]." Although the appellant did not like the terms of the LCA and did not trust her supervisors, she nonetheless had a choice to accept the terms of the LCA, face removal pursuant to the proposed removal, or retire. The fact that she was dissatisfied with her choices does not render her ultimate decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124. Furthermore, there is no indication that the agency acted improperly or took any unauthorized action regarding the proposed removal action or the LCA. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's choice between unpleasant alternatives did not render her retirement involuntary.</p>

"An employee's dissatisfaction with the options that an agency has made available to him is not sufficient to render his decision to resign or retire involuntary." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

Importantly, moreover, under this test for involuntariness, "the coercion must be the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1122.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant argues that the decisions to suspend her clearance and to place her on indefinite suspension left her no realistic alternative but to retire from federal service. These allegations, however, fail to meet the "demanding legal standard" required to demonstrate coercion. <span class="Italic">See Conforto</span>, 713 F.3d at 1121. As the administrative judge correctly explained, the agency had not yet reached a final decision to permanently revoke the appellant's security clearance at the time of her retirement, and it remained possible that she would be reinstated to employment in the event her clearance was reinstated. We do not agree that the suspension of a clearance alone rises to the level of coercion for the purposes of a constructive adverse action. The appellant's choice to retire, rather than await the final disposition of her security clearance determination, was not the result of improper pressure, intimidation, or coercion. Additionally, because of the Board's limited scope of review involving the suspension or revocation of a security clearance, we cannot consider whether the agency committed any improper acts in connection with its security clearance determination, <span class="Italic">see Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1185, and we have otherwise found no evidence of any improper act in the course of the agency's decision to indefinitely suspend the appellant that could supply the jurisdictional basis for an appeal of an involuntary retirement, <span class="Italic">see Schnedar</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CH-0752-10-0618-I-1 (NP 2/24/2011), declined to characterize a retirement as involuntary based on the appellant's concerns about an ongoing investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's analysis that the agency's alleged threatened adverse action, the commencement of an investigation into alleged misconduct by the appellant, does not render the appellant's retirement involuntary. The administrative judge correctly noted that the agency had not yet proposed an adverse action and that, "[c]onjecture of or anticipation of an adverse action does not...constitute coercion or duress on the part of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3 (citing <span class="Italic">Holman v.

Significantly, even though the appellant argues that he previously had been disciplined unfairly by the agency for similar alleged misconduct, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that at the time of his retirement a proposed adverse action was being contemplated, let alone was imminent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant did not allege that his working conditions were so intolerable as to deprive him of freedom of choice to continue his employment. Although in his petition for review the appellant more specifically pled his assertions regarding the alleged long history of agency harassment that forced his retirement, this attempt to bolster his argument does not provide justification to disturb the finding of the administrative judge in this matter. <span class="Italic">[S]ee Baldwin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that his supervisor had "alienated [him] and made [him] feel that [he is] an outsider who is not reliable and cannot be trusted." He further alleged that his supervisor also mistreated him by waiting until all of the other pipefitters had been given work assignments and had left the shop before giving the appellant numerous work orders to handle on his own. Some of these assignments required <span id="Page_2012"></span>two people, but because of the appellant's alienation in the shop, he was forced to work alone. In addition, the appellant argued that these working conditions were dangerous and that he has been injured on the job performing some of the work assignments because he was forced to work alone. The appellant, as well as employees in other shops who had witnessed the appellant's treatment by his supervisors, complained about the appellant's treatment, but nothing was done by the agency's management to rectify the situation. In sum, the appellant argues that the intolerable working conditions were created by his supervisors by isolating him from the rest of the shop, assigning him more work than others, assigning him to work two-person jobs on his own, which resulted in physical injury to the appellant on more than one occasion, and ignoring his complaints about his work situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, we find that the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation that his retirement was involuntary due to intolerable working conditions; therefore, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3220), affirmed a Board decision that the appellant was not entitled to a hearing based up allegations that his working environment was sufficiently oppressive to have compelled retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, petitioner asserts that the Board failed to consider "allegations regarding [his] working environment" and "established too high a threshold level of proof regarding [his] allegations to conclude that [his] allegations are not non-frivolous."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He asserts that he was entitled to a hearing, and that "[i]f [his] allegations of a hostile environment were to be proven in a hearing before the [Board], the [Board] would be obligated to conclude that [his] retirement constituted constructive discharge." In support of his involuntary retirement and hostile work environment claims, petitioner asserted that: he received a "Meritorious" rating rather than a "Distinguished" rating; he was denied an alternative work schedule that "would enable [him] to lengthen [his] weekends at the beach"; he was denied permission to telecommute; and that "[t]he most egregious treatment that [his supervisor] afforded [him] was to assign [him] work and check on [his] work through a junior employee in the office."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held that, as a matter of law, petitioner's allegations, "if true, would [not] render so difficult or intolerable a senior and experienced employee's working environment, that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to retire." The Department of Transportation argues that the administrative judge considered all relevant facts, including petitioner's specific allegations of a "hostile and intolerable" work environment, but viewed those allegations as insufficient to raise a non-frivolous allegation of coercion, and therefore insufficient to warrant a hearing. The Department of Transportation contends that the administrative judge properly denied petitioner's request for a hearing because petitioner failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that his retirement was involuntary, and that the Board accordingly lacks jurisdiction over petitioner's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. On review of the record before us we find that the administrative judge properly considered each of the incidents cited by petitioner as examples of harassment and reprisal. The administrative judge correctly concluded that none of petitioner's allegations constituted a legally-sufficient, non-frivolous showing of coercion, and that petitioner failed to rebut the presumption that his retirement was voluntary. The Board has no jurisdiction over a voluntary retirement, and therefore it properly dismissed petitioner's appeal for lack of jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 78 Fed. Appx. 124, 125 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), distinguished unpleasant and intolerable working conditions leading to retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's decision to resign or retire is presumed to be voluntary, and an employee who retires voluntarily has no right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Staats v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Serv.,</span> 99 F.3d 1120, 1123-24 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The Board can only assume jurisdiction over an employee's retirement if his "retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1124. Specifically, in order to establish involuntary retirement, an employee must show either: (1) that the retirement was a product of agency misinformation or deception; or (2) that the retirement was the product of agency coercion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, King argues that he was coerced into retirement by his working conditions and thus had "no choice but to resign."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notably, "the doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "[A]n employee must show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement, that the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and that the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the doctrine does not apply when an employee decides to resign or retire "because he does not want to accept a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An employee's decision to leave is no less voluntary simply because an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Judge found that King only established the following general facts: (1) that he was disappointed at not being promoted above a grade 13; (2) that he subjectively believed he was being treated unfairly; and (3) that he was not willing to relocate to San Francisco following a reorganization unless he was promoted. As part of his general findings, the Administrative Judge also concluded that King was not, as he alleges here, denied a flat-rate reimbursement, nor was he subject to intolerable working conditions on account of his coworker's inadvertently published comment. These conclusions were supported by substantial evidence and were not arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, procedurally deficient, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, the established facts do not help King rebut the presumption (by a preponderance of the evidence) that he voluntarily retired. Lack of promotions, sometimes unpleasant (but not intolerable) working conditions, and an unwillingness to relocate as part of an authorized agency reorganization do not establish the requisite involuntariness warranting jurisdiction. Instead, as in <span class="Italic">Staats,</span> they demonstrate a voluntary, albeit unpleasant, choice between continued employment and retirement. Thus, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stephens v. USDA,</span> 157 Fed. Appx. 286, 288-89 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), discerned no involuntary retirement resulting from isolation of the employee and alleged denial of accommodation for allergies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Stephens alleges that she was harassed by her supervisor and that the agency took no action in response. Among other contentions, Stephens alleges that she was ignored at staff meetings, denied use of voice-mail, denied reasonable accommodation for her allergies, and was not supported in her work efforts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ appropriately considered all of Stephens' arguments regarding coercion and harassment in the workplace, ultimately concluding that she failed to show that "a reasonable person in her position would have believed that she had no other option but to retire." Moreover, the AJ stated that the evidence of the record indicated that "[she] had contemplated retirement over a period in excess of five months and that [she] had accepted $25,000 incentive payment regarding her decision to retire."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no error in the Board's decision. We agree that, even if Stephens' allegations are taken as true, she has failed to show that the working conditions of her employment were made so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to retire. <span class="Italic">See Staats v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (explaining that "the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary"). Moreover, as the AJ found, Stephens made a reasoned decision to accept a $25,000 incentive to retire. Under these circumstances, the AJ properly concluded that "[a]lthough appellant may regret that decision now, appellant's choice does not equate to coercion." Thus, as the Board found, none of Stephens' allegations can sustain her claim that her retirement from the agency was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A retirement was not involuntary because the agency declined to geographically reassign an employee to an area that the appellant had relocated to in order to accommodate family circumstances, <span class="Italic">Matthews v.

In order to show coercion the employee must establish that "the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement, that the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and that the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Staats v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The act that Mr. Matthews identifies as an act of coercion is the agency's failure to transfer him to Binghamton. However, the circumstances that made his continued employment in Baltimore intolerable were not the result of actions taken by the agency. Although Mr. Matthews moved his family to Binghamton for strong family reasons, the agency has no obligation to help solve the problems that accompanied that move. Coercion requires more than unpleasant or difficult circumstances. <span class="Italic">Cf. Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124 ("[T]he doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a <span id="Page_2013"></span>narrow one. It does not apply to a case in which an employee decides to resign or retire because he does not want to accept a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave.") Transfer to a remote location is not a routine aspect of employment, and failure to transfer, without more, is not reasonably viewed as grounds of coerced resignation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A detail, assignment of nonsupervisor duties requiring less skill, suggestions that the appellant retire, failure to receive a fair review relative to difficulties with a subordinate, a required office move on short notice, and other problems were insufficient to convince the Board that the appellant was forced to retire. <span class="Italic">Browne v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally lacks jurisdiction to review an employee's retirement (or resignation) because such action ordinarily is voluntary and therefore is not government adverse action against the employee.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Rastogi failed to allege facts sufficient to show that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal. His factual allegations did not establish that his working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable employee would have concluded that he had no realistic choice but to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board concluded, what Rastogi's factual allegations showed was no more than disputes between an employee and his supervisors or the exercise of normal supervisory authority in a way that the employee did not like. It is not pleasant if a supervisor's position and duties are changed so that someone he previously had supervised becomes his supervisor. That is not sufficient, however, to make the former supervisor's retirement involuntary or coerced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Rastogi apparently contends that Hann's suggestion that he come to her house over the weekend to discuss work management created a hostile work environment that required him to retire, he did not retire until two years after the incident. He also argues that his work environment made him ill, and submitted a physician's statement that he had high blood pressure. That statement, however, did not indicate that he should stop working. Finally, Rastogi attempts to ground the Board's jurisdiction on his claim that he was subject to discrimination. Although the Board may adjudicate a claim of discrimination, it may do so only if it has jurisdiction on some other ground. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, F.2d 1240, 1251-53 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requirement that an employee pursue the application process for a security clearance necessary for a job that the agency wanted appellant to occupy did not establish a basis for an involuntary retirement, <span class="Italic">Pistilli v. MSPB</span>, 662 Fed. Appx. 942, 946-48 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pistilli argues that the agency's improper acts that coerced him into retiring were (a) reassigning him to the position at the LDC that required the Top Secret clearance and (b) providing him with intolerable working conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we affirm the Board's finding that the agency's choice to reassign Mr. Pistilli was not an improper act. When the agency decided to begin requiring all of the analysts in Mr. Pistilli's unit at the LDC to have Top Secret security clearances, Mr. Pistilli's position at the LDC became a position which required a Top Secret clearance. As a result, Mr. Pistilli was no longer qualified for the position at the LDC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pistilli's situation is analogous to when an employee hired for a position requiring a security clearance fails to obtain such a clearance, or he obtains one and it is later revoked. In these circumstances, the agency may terminate the employee for failing to meet an essential requirement of his position and has no obligation to transfer the employee to a non-sensitive position. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Def. Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Daney v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 25 Fed. Appx. 994, 995 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did not err in finding that the agency properly chose to reassign Mr. Pistilli from the position at the field office where it had limited work for Mr. Pistilli to his former position at the LDC which now required a Top Secret clearance. When Mr. Pistilli failed to obtain a Top Secret clearance, the agency was entitled to terminate Mr. Pistilli. While the Board in 2011 ordered Mr. Pistilli reinstated because the agency had not yet transferred Mr. Pistilli to the new position description for his job that required a Top Secret clearance when it terminated him, this order did not mean that the agency was not permitted to transfer Mr. Pistilli to the Top Secret position in the future.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the circumstances of this case, we do not think that the agency's reassignment of Mr. Pistilli would have been improper even if the agency knew--or believed it was extremely likely--that Mr. Pistilli would again fail to obtain a Top Secret clearance, or even if the agency intended to terminate Mr. Pistilli as soon as his clearance application was denied. <span class="Italic">Cf. Frey v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355, 1357, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Agencies have wide discretion in reassigning employees and may remove employees who refuse reassignment, if the reassignment was in good faith and based upon legitimate management considerations.). Similarly, we do not think that the agency's reassignment of Mr. Pistilli would have been improper even if it was against Mr. Pistilli's desires and even if the agency did not provide Mr. Pistilli with a meaningful opportunity to accept an alternative nonsensitive position. <span class="Italic">See Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 1581. As a result, the arguments on appeal about Mr. Pistilli's likelihood of obtaining a Top Secret clearance on his second attempt, Mr. Pistilli's opportunity to accept an alternative position, and whether the agency would have terminated Mr. Pistilli had his application been denied are all irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency's choice to reassign Mr. Pistilli to the position description for his former position that required a Top Secret security clearance was not improper, the Board did not err in finding that the agency's decision to do so did not coerce Mr. Pistilli into retiring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Pistilli argued that he suffered intolerable working conditions based on his not being provided work to do. As the agency had explained to Mr. Pistilli that it had limited work available for him while he lacked a security clearance, the Board did not err in finding that this working condition was not an improper act by the agency to coerce Mr. Pistilli to retire.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant with medical problems was given the choice of retiring or performing temporary administrative work until his medical condition improved. The resulting retirement was voluntary. The choices were not unlawful or misleading. <span class="Italic">Bacon v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 181, 182-83 (1982), the appellant, a cook, alleged that his retirement was forced because the agency required him to take a fitness examination, counseled him about wearing a hair net while on duty, and sent him an unsolicited printout of retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hardwick v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3149) (retirement was not involuntary because the appellant was uncertain whether his GM-15 job would be canceled and whether he would qualify for retention at a lower grade). <span class="Italic">Caveney v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not err by giving greater weight to relatively recent events, i.e., those occurring within 14 months prior to retirement, rather than to events of greater antiquity, in determining whether an appellant's working conditions were intolerable, resulting in a forced resignation. A reviewing court suggested that the appellant demonstrated that he had an alternative to retirement by tolerating earlier harassment. <span class="Italic">Terban v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Deem v. MSPB</span>, 575 Fed. Appx. 878, 880-81 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), noted the significance of the length of time between events complained of and the retirement date:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in reaching its determination, the Board gave particular weight to the fact that Ms. Deem had stayed in the new position for a full ten months after her transfer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Indeed, we have previously noted that the amount of time between the employer's alleged behavior and the employee's retirement is highly probative as to whether an employee's retirement is involuntary. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In one case, the time period between the final incident and the appellant's retirement was three weeks and the court found this time period short enough to indicate involuntariness. <span class="Italic">Bates v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 659, 668 (1996). In contrast, a <span id="Page_2015"></span>long period of time between the actions and the employee's retirement diminishes the causal link between the two events. <span class="Italic">Terban</span>, 216 F.3d at 1024. The Board was therefore correct to note that the ten month time period in Ms. Deem's case diminishes the idea that her retirement was due to Ms. Lewis's behavior prior to the February 2010 transfer.</p>

The Board denied the claim of an involuntary retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no allegation that the appellant suffered any ill-treatment at the hands of an agency supervisor or agency employee outside the context of the union. The appellant reported the most serious incident to the agency, which took action and issued no-contact orders within a week, after which there is no allegation of any further incidents at work.
