<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-62"><span class="space">1.</span> Tailoring the Proposal to Suit the Harm; Overbroad Proposals; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Minerals Management</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv. V. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1160-63 (D.C. Cir. 1992), added to the D.C. Circuit's critique of FLRA's administration of the arrangements test by requiring that proposed arrangements be narrowly tailored to foreseeable adverse effects:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In each of the three consolidated decisions before us, a labor union submitted proposals for negotiation; a government agency (in two instances the Department of Education, in one the Department of the Interior) asserted that the proposal was protected from negotiability by the management rights doctrine. The union asserted a &#x00A7; 7106(b) exception. The Authority held each proposal negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Dept. of Education Council of AFGE Locals and U.S. Dept. of Education</span>, 38 FLRA 1068 (1990) ("<span class="Italic">Education I</span>"), the labor union submitted a proposal regarding Education's drug testing program, asking Education to "agree[&#8197;] that the establishment and administration of its drug abuse testing program will be done in strict compliance with the U.S. Constitution and all applicable laws, rules and regulations and this [collective bargaining] agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1074. Education asserted that this provision directly interfered with the management right to determine "internal security practices" under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). The Authority agreed but ruled the proposal negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) as an "appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1077 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. 24 (1986)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority opined that the implementation of a drug testing program "could adversely affect employees" through disciplinary actions and harm to reputation that would befall an employee testing positive for drugs. <span class="Italic">Education I</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1077. Reasoning that the "proposal attempts to mitigate the adverse consequences of the Agency's establishment of its drug testing program by requiring the Agency to adhere to the limits established in the United States Constitution, applicable laws, rules and regulations," <span class="Italic">id</span>., the Authority held the drug testing proposal to be a mandatory subject of bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1077-78.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the reconsideration hearing, Education asserted that the proposal was "designed not to deal with the aftermath of the exercise of the management right, but to <span class="Italic">prevent</span> adverse impact from occurring at all." <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span> <span class="Italic">Decision on Reconsideration</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. No. 107, at 4 (March 15, 1991) ("<span class="Italic">Education I Reconsideration</span>"). According to Education, the only employees who could claim to be adversely affected by the drug testing program were those who tested positive; yet, the union proposal extended preventative protection to all employees, including those never subjected to the test and those who tested negative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority, repeating its finding that there were "reasonably foreseeable adverse effects on employees" caused by the implementation of the drug testing program, found no merit in the agency's plea that arrangements could be imposed only to ameliorate the effects on those employees testing positive, and reaffirmed its findings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second consolidated decision, <span class="Italic">Department of Interior, Mineral Management Service</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. No. 111 (March 18, 1991) ("<span class="Italic">Interior</span>"), involved a union proposal identical to that in <span class="Italic">Education I</span>. Interior contended that the union had not detailed how the proposal constituted an "appropriate arrangement" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 2. Conceding that the union had not "specifically raised an argument in this case that the proposal" falls within &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority nevertheless applied its ruling in <span class="Italic">Education I</span> and held for the union. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the final decision, <span class="Italic">Department of Education II</span>, 42 FLRA No. 34 (Sept. 27, 1991), Education refused to bargain over a proposal requiring it to "comply with its own regulations governing personnel policies and practices, and general conditions of employment whether such regulations are discretionary or mandatory and whether or not such regulations involve an exercise of a management right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 2. Education's arguments included an assertion that the "proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)...because it is not responsive to any identified adverse impact." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 3 (internal quotes omitted.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the same approach as in <span class="Italic">Education I</span>, the Authority found that the proposal interfered with &#x00A7; 7106(a) management rights, <span class="Italic">id</span>. At 11, but was an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 14. It maintained that employees "may be 'adversely affected,'" by management actions in contravention of "existing regulatory requirements," and that the proposal was not excessive because it provided employees with "clear assurance" that management would comply with its regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The proposal would also "enable employees to challenge alleged noncompliance through the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the merits, Education and Interior first argue that &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) cannot encompass proposals such as the ones at issue here, because these proposals benefit employees before they are "adversely affected" by a management action. According to the agencies, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) mandates bargaining only over proposals that provide some ameliorative arrangement for an employee who has suffered some adverse effect, such as the consequences that may result from either a positive drug test or the inconsistent application of a personnel regulation. The agencies draw support for their argument from Congress's use of the past tense in the phrase "adversely affected," arguing this shows Congress intended that "employees must be adversely affected <span class="Italic">before</span> the 'arrangement' is operative." In effect, the agencies argue, the FLRA's interpretation of "adversely affected" "edit[s] the past tense out [of] the statute altogether." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the agencies that the plain language of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) demands that the FLRA assure that arrangements are tailored to redress only those employees adversely affected by a management action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183, 1187 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("<span class="Italic">Local 2782</span>") (Scalia, J.) (suggesting that because &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is an exception allowing employees to negotiate over substantive management rights, it must be "limited to 'employees adversely affected' as opposed to <span class="Italic">all</span> employees"). Congress provided that unions could negotiate over "appropriate" arrangements <span class="Italic">for employees adversely affected</span> by the exercise of a management prerogative. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). By this, Congress necessarily excluded arrangements not tailored to benefit the adversely affected....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As written, the proposals before us would apparently allow employee challenges to any action stemming from implementation of an agency drug program, or any agency personnel action regardless of whether any challenging employee was adversely affected by such action. More importantly, the Authority did not assess whether the rights conferred by the proposals, if adopted, would be limited to employees who suffered adverse effects as foreseen by the Authority. In <span class="Italic">Education I</span> and <span class="Italic">Education I Rehearing</span>, the Authority halted its analysis once it found that the drug testing proposal might succor employees who suffered the adverse effects flowing from a positive drug test. The Authority did not go on to consider whether the balm provided by the proposal would be administered only to hurts arising from the program, and to employees suffering such harm. Likewise, the Authority in <span class="Italic">Education II</span> ceased its analysis once it found that the proposal could benefit employees harmed by an agency action in contravention of an agency personnel policy, neglecting to appraise whether the proposal could be used to allow a plethora of challenges to agency personnel actions focusing on far more than adverse effects suffered by employees from those actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the Authority, we read &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) as unambiguously applying <span id="page_591"></span>only where the FLRA has identified the reasonably foreseeable adverse effects that will flow from some management action; and only when the proposed arrangement is tailored to benefit or compensate those employees suffering those adverse effects. As the Authority did not fulfill the second part of this requirement in these challenged orders, it acted contrary to law. We therefore set aside these challenged orders. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We pause to note what we are not doing in this case.&#x2003;We are not holding that the use of the past tense in the phrase "adversely affected" creates a temporal wall forbidding any negotiability except as to harm that has already occurred. We recently considered and rejected this interpretation in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("<span class="Italic">Department of Treasury</span>"). There we held that the statute was ambiguous as to whether such temporal import was intended in the phrase or whether it was an adjectival formulation not carrying temporal import. As we found &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) ambiguous, we deferred to the administrative agency's interpretation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1072 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S. Ct. at 2781-82). As we found FLRA's adjectival interpretation reasonable, we affirmed the Authority's decision mandating the agency to negotiate over a union proposal that management furnish "evaluative recordation" to employees before using it in personnel decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither do we hold that "appropriate arrangements" target in advance the specific individual employees who will be adversely affected. As we held in <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury</span>, "nothing in the language of paragraph (b)(3)...requires union proposals to target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected. We think it sufficient that the Authority reasonably concluded that evaluations will surely have adverse effects on some employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1071.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing we say here is in conflict with either holding in <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury</span>. The Authority has already ruled in these consolidated cases that the subject matter of each proposal is within the management rights doctrine. <span class="Italic">Education I</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1077; <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. No. 111, at 3 (incorporating <span class="Italic">Education 1</span>); <span class="Italic">Education II</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. No. 34, at 13. As the proposals are not within the exception to that doctrine created by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), we conclude that the petition for review is well taken and that the proposals are not negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals 33 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 64 FLRA 728, 730 (2010) ("'[P]rophylactic' proposals will be found sufficiently tailored in situations where it is not possible to determine reliably which employees will be adversely affected by an agency action so as to draft a proposal to apply only to those employees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>An arrangement need not 'target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected.' <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Minerals Mgmt.

<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit reemphasized <span class="Italic">Minerals Mgmt.</span> in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 1190, 1197-98 (D.C. Cir. 1993), setting aside an FLRA order in <span class="Italic">NLRB Union and NLRB</span>, 42 FLRA 1305 (1991), approving the negotiability of proposals, advanced as appropriate arrangements, seeking to modify a change in the procedures used by management to develop performance appraisals. In the court's estimation, the proposals did not fit within the "arrangements" class because they were insufficiently tailored to redress the individual impact of the changes in the appraisal system:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Minerals Management</span>, we considered two separate proposals relating to drug testing programs that the FLRA had held negotiable as appropriate arrangements. Under the first proposal, the agency would have been required to "agree that the establishment and administration of its drug abuse testing program will be done in strict compliance with the U.S. Constitution and all applicable laws, rules and regulations and this collective bargaining agreement." [969 F.2d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992)], at 1160. The second proposal would have required the agency to "comply with its own regulations governing personnel policies and practices, and general conditions of employment whether such regulations are discretionary or mandatory and whether or not such regulations involve an exercise of a management right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court reversed the FLRA's ruling, finding that the proposals were too broad to qualify as arrangements for adversely affected employees. According to the court:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he plain language of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) demands that the FLRA assure that arrangements are tailored to redress only those employees adversely affected by a management action. Congress provided that unions could negotiate over "appropriate arrangements <span class="Italic">for employees adversely affected</span> by the exercise" of a management prerogative. By this, Congress necessarily excluded arrangements not tailored to benefit the adversely affected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 1162. The court then reasoned that the drug testing proposals failed to meet this standard because it was not clear that the rights they conferred "would be limited to employees who suffered adverse effects as foreseen by the Authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Justice, INS v. FLRA</span>, 975 F.2d 218, 225-26 (5th Cir. 1992) (following <span class="Italic">Minerals Management</span> and holding a proposal nonnegotiable because it was "not tailored to benefit only those employees who would be adversely affected" by the agency's actions); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Local 2782</span>, 702 F.2d at 1187 (observing that section 7106(b)(3) is "limited to 'employees adversely affected' as opposed to all employees").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">Minerals Management</span>, the proposal advanced by the Union in the present case is a prophylactic measure applicable to all employees, instead of being "tailored to benefit or compensate those employees suffering...adverse effects." <span class="Italic">Minerals Management</span>, 969 F.2d at 1162. In particular, section (1) of the proposal requires that all employees receive an independent written evaluation by their appraising official. The FLRA's analysis of section (1), however, simply ignores this fact. Indeed, the Authority made no effort to discern "whether the balm provided by the proposal would be administered only to hurts arising from" the performance appraisal process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an attempt to avoid the conclusion that this case is governed by <span class="Italic">Minerals Management</span>, the FLRA relied heavily on <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("<span class="Italic">IRS</span>"). In that case, the union proposed that personnel evaluations would have to be provided to employees within forty-five days of their development. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. At 1070 &#x0026; n.1. If evaluations were not furnished to employees within the forty-five day period, they could "not be used by the supervisor or by a ranking panel or official"; and any material they contained that might adversely affect an employee's appraisal or rating would have to be destroyed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. At 1070 n.1. The court affirmed the FLRA's ruling that the proposal was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> At 1073. In reaching this result, the court rejected the agency's argument that because a given evaluation could be positive rather than negative, the proposal did not relate to adversely affected employees. Although the court acknowledged that "an adverse effect cannot be merely speculative," <span class="Italic">id</span>. At 1071, it stated that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">we see nothing in the language of paragraph (b)(3) [of section 7106] that requires union proposals to target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected. We think it sufficient that the Authority reasonably concluded that evaluations will surely have adverse effects on some employees<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Admittedly, the first two aspects of the proposal in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>--the requirement that evaluations be furnished to employees within forty-five days and the restriction on using such evaluations if not disclosed during that period--cannot be readily distinguished from section (1). By their terms, these provisions applied to all employees. Nevertheless, the <span class="Italic">IRS</span> proposal was considered as a whole and included a remedy, the removal and destruction of any negative information relating to the employee, that was confined to those employees who were likely to be adversely affected. By contrast, there is no equivalent limitation in the present case. Indeed, to the extent that section (1) is supplemented by Option 2, the principal remedy here is the disclosure of the independent evaluations to all employees, not just to those who receive negative appraisals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given our conclusion that section (1) is not negotiable and the fact that Option 2 cannot stand independently of section (1), we need not address the parties' separate arguments regarding the negotiability of Option 2.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Fifth Circuit weighed in against overbroad proposals in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS v. FLRA</span>, 975 F.2d 218, 225-26 (5th Cir. 1992), disallowing FLRA's determination that a proposal was negotiable that allowed internal investigations into shooting incidents to be delayed for up to two days to permit employees to consult with union representatives. The proposal extended protections to employees who would not likely be adversely affected by the investigations, a result that made the proposal nonnegotiable as an arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 5 is not tailored to benefit only those employees who would be adversely affected by the INS's questioning. The language of Proposal 5 unambiguously covers employees who are not directly involved in shooting incidents. Furthermore, the Authority recognized that the "right to Union representation encompassed by the proposal would not depend on an affected employee's belief that he or she was subject to discipline." <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and National INS Service Council and U.S. Dept. of Justice</span>, INS 40 FLRA No. 51, at 29. The FLRA argues that since the results of the agency's investigations "may provide a basis upon which an employee is disciplined[,] it is reasonably foreseeable that some bargaining unit employee can expect to be disciplined or otherwise adversely affected by the results of the management's decision to investigate." While we do not deny that <span class="Italic">some</span> employees might expect to be disciplined or be otherwise adversely affected by the results of the <span id="page_592"></span>management's investigation, Proposal 5 makes no attempt to specifically protect those employees. The proposal simply covers <span class="Italic">all</span> employees who are subject to the agency's investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The recent decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Minerals Management Service v. FLRA, AFGE, AFL-CIO Local 3457</span>, 969 F.2d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992), is on point. In response to an agency drug testing program, a union proposed "allowing employee challenges to any action stemming from implementation of an agency drug program, or any agency personnel action regardless of whether any challenging employee was adversely affected by such action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1162. The <span class="Italic">Local 3457</span> court reversed the FLRA's negotiability ruling as contrary to law. The court explained: "Unlike the Authority, we read &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) as unambiguously applying only where the FLRA has identified the reasonably foreseeable adverse effects that will flow from some management action; and only when the proposed arrangement is tailored to benefit or compensate those employees suffering those adverse effects." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court reversed the Authority's order because the Authority did not "consider whether the balm provided by the proposal would be administered only to hurts arising from the program, and to employees suffering such harm." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Proposal 5 suffers from the same fatal disease that killed the union proposal in <span class="Italic">Local 3457</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Proposal 5 is not negotiable as an arrangement for adversely affected employees, we need not address the second prong of the excessive interference test regarding whether the proposal excessively interferes with the management's reserved rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">Taking a restricted view of the nature of adverse impact that is sufficient to trigger arrangements bargaining, in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 791 F.2d 324, 326-27 (4th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">rev'g</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Council of SSA Locals and DHHS, SSA</span>, 17 FLRA 657 (1985), the Fourth Circuit announced, really as <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, that changes in work requirements did not have sufficient adverse effect on employees to warrant bargaining. That argument did not appear to have been considered by FLRA in the underlying decision. The argument was not developed by the court; there was no mention of any other decision or legislative history that supported the conclusion reached by the court. Nonetheless, FLRA latched onto the holding and applied it to preclude negotiations over the impact of changes in or the institution of performance standards. <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO</span>, 25 FLRA 384, 396 (1987). Changes in work practices unrelated to performance standards also failed to support arrangements bargaining under the Fourth Circuit rationale. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 257, 259 (1987). The decisions are many, however, and <a href="0100-2023-14-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a> contains discussion of negotiable proposals addressing changes in work assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent">Taking into consideration admonitions from the courts, FLRA still finds that a well-crafted proposal that creates an arrangement targeted for a new management practice involving benefits is negotiable and it need not precisely identify the individual employees it will benefit, as FLRA explained in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3258 and DHUD, Boston Reg'l Office</span>, 48 FLRA 232, 236 n.2 (1993) (approving as negotiable Proposal 1, designed to equalize among qualified employees additional work created by use of a new mail metering system):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with our concurring colleague that in order to constitute an arrangement, it must be shown that a proposal would benefit <span class="Italic">only</span> those employees suffering the adverse effects addressed by the proposal. Rather, we read the decision in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, New Orleans v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1992), as requiring only that an arrangement be tailored, or designed, to redress adversely affected employees. As we stated in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Falls Church, Virginia</span>, 47 FLRA 705, 727 (1993), an arrangement may include within its scope employees who might not suffer an adverse effect as a result of management action if the impact of the proposal with regard to those employees is neutral and if they have "the potential to come within the class of employees who would be adversely affected by the circumstances addressed by the [proposal]."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Comptroller of the Currency</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-176.html">61 FLRA 871</a> (2006) (<span class="Italic">OCC</span>), declared negotiable, despite management concerns about the vagueness and overbreadth of the proposal, a broad provision that sought protection against inequitable application of the employer's policies and procedures. Proposal 1 in the <span class="Italic">OCC</span> case was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In implementing any rules, regulation or policies affecting personnel policies or procedures which involve the exercise of management rights under 5 U.S.C. section 7106(a) and (b)(1), the Employer will apply such rules, regulations, or policies fairly and consistently so as to avoid adverse impact on the working conditions of unit employees. However, this does not in any way affect the Employer's rights to establish, maintain or modify such rules, regulation or policies, consistent with applicable law, rule and regulation and the terms of this Agreement. [e.g., management has the statutory right to establish substantive policies exercising management rights, subject to the Union's right to bargain over procedures and appropriate arrangements].</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">OCC</span> analyzed the negotiability of the proposal, 61 FLRA at 873-75:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 requires the Agency to apply "Agency rules, regulations[,] and policies in a fair and consistent manner with respect to employees. The Union "emphasized that the proposal does not seek to address the Agency's right[&#8197;] to establish its policies, rules[,] and regulations, simply the application of these policies, rules[,] and regulations." According to the Union, the proposal is "intended as a catch-all...that would apply to the Agency's policies involving an exercise of [a] management right[&#8197;] that were not specifically addressed and covered in the collective bargaining agreement."<span class="Italic"> </span>The Union explains that under the "first sentence of the proposal, the Agency would determine whether the respective rules, regulations or policies involve an exercise of management rights under the Statute."<span class="Italic"> </span>The Union stated that the second sentence of the proposal concerning "applicable law, rule and regulation" refers to other applicable legal requirements.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Agency does not dispute any of these interpretations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in the Petition, the Union explained "fair and consistent application" by stating that the proposal seeks to "prevent favoritism, inconsistent application or compliance, or arbitrary treatment of employees" so as to avoid adverse impact on the working conditions of unit employees with respect to Agency "rules, regulations or policies which involve the exercise of management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the proposal's wording and the Union's explanation, we interpret the proposal as requiring "once the [Agency] establishes its substantive policy" involving the exercise of a management right, such policy "be applied fairly and consistently so as to avoid adverse impact." That is, "the proposal does not require that the policy itself be 'fair and equitable' on its face; rather, the proposal simply requires that it be applied, or followed, fairly and equitably, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, once the Agency establishes a policy or rule, it will be consistently applied (or not applied) to similarly situated bargaining unit employees, without bias, favoritism, arbitrariness or consideration of reasons not relating to merit or mission." [5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Our interpretation of the meaning of this proposal, unless modified by the parties, would apply in other disputes, such as arbitration proceedings, where the construction of the proposal is at issue.<span class="Italic"> See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Evergreen and Rainier Chapters</span>, 57 FLRA 475, 477 n.11 (2001)<span class="Italic"> </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Education Ass'n, Overseas Education Ass'n, Laurel Bay Teachers Ass'n</span>, 51 FLRA 733, 741-42 (1996)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Affects the Agency's Rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal encompasses Agency rules, regulations, or policies concerning the Agency's exercise of its rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. The proposal, as the Union concedes, affects &#x00A7; 7106(a) because it requires the Agency to apply, in a fair and consistent manner, its rules, regulations, or policies that constitute the exercise of management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that restrict the range of management action under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute constitute limitations on the exercise of that right and for that reason have been held to directly interfere with the exercise of the right. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 597 (1997). The Authority has held that terms such as "fair and equitable," "equitable," and "equitably," when used in proposals that govern the exercise of a management right, constitute substantive limitations on the exercise of that right, and thus affect the right. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">id. </span>(<span class="Italic">citing AFGE, Local 3258</span>, 48 FLRA 232, 234 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the proposal requires the Agency to apply Agency rules, regulations, or policies that affect personnel policies or procedures concerning employees' conditions of employment "fairly and consistently." To the extent that the proposal encompasses Agency rules, regulations, or policies, affecting the exercise of management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute and requires the Agency to apply such rules, regulations, or policies "fairly and consistently," the proposal affects &#x00A7; 7106(a) by imposing a substantive limitation on the Agency's exercise of its &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 53 FLRA at 597.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, the proposal affects the Agency's exercise of management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Constitutes an Appropriate Arrangement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The test for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether a proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2015</span>, 53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997). The alleged arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects <span id="page_593"></span>attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2280, Iron Mountain, Mich.</span>, 57 FLRA 742,743 (2002); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1687</span>, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996). If a proposal is an arrangement, the Authority then determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not argue that Proposal 1 is not an arrangement for employees adversely affected by its application of Agency rules, regulations, or policies requiring the exercise of a management right, but rather, asserts that the proposal is not sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. As the Agency does not claim that Proposal 1 is not an arrangement, we find that the proposal constitutes an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether the proposal is sufficiently tailored, Proposal 1 "does not require that the policy [requiring the exercise of a management right] itself be 'fair and equitable' on its face; rather, the proposal simply requires that [such policy, rule or regulation] be applied, or followed, fairly and equitably, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, once the Agency establishes [such policy, rule, or regulation], it will be consistently applied (or not applied) to similarly situated bargaining unit employees, without bias, favoritism, arbitrariness or consideration of reasons not relating to merit or mission.<span class="Italic"> </span>It is reasonable to anticipate that some employees will not be adversely affected by the Agency's exercise of its management rights through application of its policies, regulations, or rules. However, the proposal targets employees adversely affected by any unfair or inconsistent application of such policies, regulations, or rules that, as the Union explained, involves favoritism, arbitrariness or consideration of reasons not relating to merit or mission. We find, therefore, that the proposal is sufficiently tailored because it is targeted to avoid adverse impact by unfair and inconsistent application of management's rights, and by its terms, it would not apply to employees who do not suffer adverse impact. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the proposal excessively interferes with management's rights, the Agency asserts (1) that the proposal is "so broad that it is impossible to determine under what circumstances and to which employees the proposal would apply[;]" and (2) that "without knowing the specific policy...that the Union is seeking to enforce, it is impossible to...assess the degree of intrusion on management's rights." As discussed above, consistent with its wording and the Union's explanation, the proposal targets employees adversely affected by any unfair or inconsistent application of the Agency's policies, regulations, or rules that, as the Union explained, involves favoritism, arbitrariness or consideration of reasons not relating to merit or mission. The Agency thus would be able to determine the circumstances and the employees to which the proposal would apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, the Agency has not established that Proposal 1 would substantially burden the Agency's exercise of its management rights in the application of its policies, regulations, and rules. The Agency has not argued that it is burdened by treating employees fairly and consistently and thereby avoiding favoritism, arbitrariness or consideration of reasons not relating to merit or mission. Rather, the Agency asserts that the proposal is "too broad" to assess the extent of the intrusion into management rights. However, as we found above, the proposal is targeted. The proposal ensures employees that Agency's policies, rules, and regulations will be applied in a fair and consistent manner and that those employees adversely affected by any unfair or inconsistent application of such policies, rules and regulations, that as the Union explained, involve favoritism, arbitrariness or consideration of reasons not relating to merit or mission, could challenge any alleged unfair or inconsistent application through the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3258</span>, 48 FLRA 232, 233-37 (1993) (proposal that workload be redistributed in a fair and equitable manner, consistent with the union's explanation, found negotiable as an appropriate arrangement);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 32</span>, 3 FLRA 784, 789-793 (1980) (proposal that required management to apply performance standards it had established in a fair and equitable manner, consistent with union's explanation, found negotiable as an appropriate arrangement). Further, the Agency claimed only that "it is likely that every one of the [&#x00A7;] 7106(a) rights is affected. The Agency did not explain how any particular one of its rights would be excessively interfered with by requiring the Agency to apply such regulation in the manner described above.

Changes in portions of such schedules, therefore, have direct and immediate effects on other portions. We will not, in these circumstances, adopt a rule limiting a party to such an agreement to bargaining over only the exact change proposed by the other party. To do so would be inconsistent with common understandings of collective bargaining agreements as well as with the policies and purposes of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1994 FLRA synthesized some of the developing law governing arrangements bargaining as limited by the necessity for demonstrable impact on the unit as a precondition to a supportable bargaining demand. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 243 and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 17, 183-85 (1994) (Provisions 1 and 2), considered the negotiability of a means for employees to raise their concerns about employee attire through the ranks of management. [The details of the proposal are discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-298.html#sec6-299">Grooming and Dress Codes</a>."] Of significance here is FLRA's assessment of the nature of the impact required to trigger a bargaining responsibility. FLRA explained that although proposals must meet the adverse exercise of management rights, the proposals need not be tailored with surgical precision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority established an analytical framework for determining whether proposals that directly interfere with management's rights <span id="page_594"></span>are nevertheless negotiable because they constitute appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under the framework established, we initially determine whether a proposal constitutes an arrangement. To do this, we ascertain whether the proposal in question seeks to address, compensate for, or prevent adverse effects on employees produced by the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. At 31. If the proposal satisfies the first part of this analysis, we then determine whether the proposed arrangement is appropriate. Under this second part, we examine the competing practical needs of the parties and determine whether the negative impact on management's rights is disproportionate to the benefits that the arrangement confers on employees such that the proposal excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The application of the first part of this analytical framework has been the subject of recent court decisions in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 1190 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (<span class="Italic">NLRB </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>);<span class="Italic"> United States Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service v.

Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service</span>). As expressed in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that "a prophylactic measure applicable to all employees, instead of being 'tailored to benefit or compensate those employees suffering...adverse effects[&#8197;]'" does not qualify as an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 3 F.2d at 1198 (quoting <span class="Italic">Minerals</span> <span class="Italic">Management</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 969 F.2d at 1162). In the court's view, in order to qualify as an arrangement that is negotiable under section 7106(b)(3), a proposal must be "'tailored to redress only those employees adversely affected by a management action.'" <span class="Italic">NLRB </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA,</span> 3 F.2d at 1197 (quoting <span class="Italic">Minerals</span> <span class="Italic">Management Service</span>, 969 F.2d at 1162). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit adopted a similar approach in <span class="Italic">INS </span>v.<span class="Italic"> FLRA</span>. However, the court emphasized that it does not require that an arrangement "'target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected.'" <span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service</span>, 969 F.2d at 1163 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Office of the Chief</span> <span class="Italic">Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). Additionally, the court has noted that it does not hold that the "use of the past tense in the phrase 'adversely affected' creates a temporal wall forbidding any negotiability except as to harm that has already occurred." <span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service</span>, 969 F.2d at 1163.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general proposition, we agree with the courts that under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, an arrangement must be tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects flowing from the exercise of management's rights and cannot be so broad in its sweep that it applies to all employees regardless of whether they are likely to be adversely affected by management action that comes within the purview of management's rights. However, we do not believe that we should require proposals presented as appropriate arrangements to be so narrowly tailored that the ability of adversely affected employees to obtain benefits under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute would be seriously impaired. Such a reading would not give full effect to section 7106(b)(3), which is intended to "enable[&#8197;] employees adversely affected by an exercise of section 7106(a) management rights, though entirely proper, to bargain over arrangements appropriate to ease the impact of management's action." <span class="Italic">Overseas Education</span> <span class="Italic">Association, Inc. </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA,</span> 876 F.2d 960, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Thus, in order to give full effect to the purpose and intent of section 7106(b)(3), in applying the analytical framework for determining whether a proposal constitutes an arrangement, we will not require that proposals be tailored with surgical precision. While the courts' statements to the effect that arrangements must be tailored to benefit "only" those employees who would be adversely affected by agency actions might be read to require such precision, we note that those statements were made in the context of proposals that applied broadly to all employees and were devoid of any attempt to target specifically those employees suffering adverse effects. Indeed...there are circumstances where it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict which employees will suffer adverse effects as a consequence of the exercise of a management right. Significantly, as we have previously noted, the D.C. Circuit has stated that proposals need not target in advance the specific individual employees who will be adversely affected.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA provided additional guidance in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 190-94 <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determining to be negotiable Provision 4, pressing for agreement that the employer not assign an immediate supervisor to solicit or collect Combined Federal Campaign pledges or contributions from subordinates. As to whether the proposal, designed to reduce coercion during charitable campaigns, was sufficiently tailored to meet the foreseeably adverse impact of the exercise of a management right, FLRA concluded that proposals that are prophylactic in nature, that are intended to eliminate the possibility of an adverse effect, may constitute appropriate arrangements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the issue of whether this provision is negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute notwithstanding the fact that it directly interferes with management's right to assign work. The Union has claimed as a general matter that all of the provisions in this case constitute appropriate arrangements within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As to this particular provision, the Union asserts that it is intended to protect employees from coercion by their immediate supervisors to make pledges and contributions to civic and charitable programs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytical framework that was articulated in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, we first determine whether this provision constitutes an "arrangement." Generally speaking, fund-raising activities in the Federal Government are voluntary in nature and employee coercion is prohibited. <span class="Italic">See, for example</span>, Executive Order 12353, as amended, &#x00A7; 4; Pub. L. No. 100-202 (5 USC &#x00A7; 1101 Note); and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 950.108. It is recognized by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is responsible for overseeing the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), the only authorized charitable fund-raising drive in the Federal workplace, that solicitation of employees by any individual in their supervisory chain of command is inconsistent with the policy of preventing coercive activities in Federal fund-raising. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 950.108. Additionally, we note that regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics prohibit a Federal employee who is engaging in fundraising in a personal capacity from personally soliciting funds or other support from a subordinate. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2635.808 (c)I.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that coercing employees with respect to their participation in civic and charitable programs in the workplace is an adverse effect of management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute to assign the work of soliciting such participation. As recognized by the regulations discussed above, it is undeniable that solicitation of pledges and contributions from an employee by a superior is inherently coercive. We do not rule out that with respect to some employees, personality traits and circumstances may render them resistant to various forms of inherent coercion. However, it is impossible to determine reliably which employees will be influenced by a particular circumstance that is inherently coercive and which employees will be immune to the pressure involved in such inherent coercion. Although this provision is not tailored to benefit only those employees who actually would be affected by inherent coercion, its scope is limited to those employees who would be solicited by their supervisors. Clearly, this provision is intended to address the coercion that inheres in that circumstance by preventing employees from being subjected to solicitation by their supervisors. Proposals that are prophylactic in nature, in that they are intended to eliminate the possibility of an adverse effect, may constitute appropriate arrangements negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example, VA, Department of Memorial Affairs</span>, 40 FLRA at 685-86.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In many instances, particularly where prophylactic proposals are involved, there is a limit to the extent to which proposals may be tailored without severely hampering the union's ability to address in a meaningful and effective manner adverse effects resulting from the exercise of a management right. For example, in some instances it may be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict with accuracy which employees actually will suffer adverse effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To illustrate this point, we posit a proposal requiring that the entrance to a building, in which bargaining unit employees work, be kept locked with entry permitted only to employees or other authorized persons for the purpose of protecting employees who work in an unsafe neighborhood from physical harm. Such a proposal would entail the adoption of a particular practice to safeguard agency personnel. A proposal establishing such a requirement directly interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, the proposal seeks to prevent adverse effects that reasonably could result from the agency's choice of internal security practices regarding the level of access allowed to the building. Foreseeable adverse effects include the actual occurrence of physical harm to employees as well as the more generalized anxiety among the workforce that could reasonably result from being subjected to the possibility that physical harm could occur. There could be no certainty that any employee actually would suffer harm as a result of criminal activity in the building, and the identity of victims would be equally unpredictable. Similarly, it would be difficult to predict which employees would feel anxious about their potential for physical harm; indeed, many employees may be reluctant to admit to such anxiety. Moreover, it is likely that, based on their particular circumstances, some employees would be more vulnerable than others to attack and the debilitating effects of the fears generated by an unsafe workplace. In our view, such a proposal should not be disqualified as an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute merely because it is impossible to predict which employees actually will suffer adverse effects if the door is left unlocked. Such a result would substantially impair the ability of employees to address in a meaningful and effective manner the adverse effects that it is reasonably foreseeable will result from an exercise of management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_595"></span>In determining whether a proposal constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we will find that a proposal is sufficiently tailored if it targets a group of employees that is likely to be harmed by the exercise of a management right and seeks to address, compensate for, or prevent the actual or anticipated adverse effects of the exercise of the management right or rights on those employees. We disagree with our dissenting colleague that in order for a proposal to constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3), it must be so narrowly tailored as to benefit or compensate <span class="Italic">only</span> those employees who would suffer an adverse effect as a result of an exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, although Provision 4 in this case would encompass some employees in addition to those who would be swayed by inherent coercion, it is sufficiently tailored in that it targets a group of employees that is likely to be harmed by a particular exercise of management's right to assign work and seeks to address or prevent the actual or anticipated adverse effects of that exercise of the management right on those employees. Consequently, we find that this provision constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, San Diego</span>, 49 FLRA 1074, 1083-84 (1994), reflected the approaches of two FLRA members concerning the requirement that arrangements proposals be tailored to the specific needs of employees in response to specific exercises of management rights. At issue was a proposal (Provision 2) that "downtime" be approved for packing and moving or systems failure as to an office move that could affect employees' ability to meet performance standards. The proposal was not sufficiently tailored to be negotiable as an arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons stated in the separate opinions of Member Armendariz and Chairman McKee set forth below, the Authority finds that Provision 2 does not constitute an arrangement because it is not tailored and is, therefore, nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opinion of Member Armendariz</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In my opinion, Provision 2 is not an arrangement for the following reasons. I find that consistent with my separate opinion in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span> [49 FLRA 176 (1994)], in order for a proposal to constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, it must be tailored so as to benefit or compensate <span class="Italic">only</span> those employees who would suffer an identifiable adverse effect as a result of the exercise of a management right. Because Provision 2 is not limited only to those employees who would receive lower performance appraisals as a result of the factors noted in the provision, but applies to all employees who have less time to perform their GJTs [Generic Job Tasks], Provision 2 is not an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As Provision 2 directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work and is not an arrangement, I conclude that Provision 2 is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opinion of Chairman McKee</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span>, the Authority agreed with various court decisions that under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, arrangements must be tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects from the exercise of a management right and cannot be so broad as to apply to all employees without regard to whether they are likely to suffer such adverse effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As worded, I conclude, in agreement with my colleagues, that Provision 2 affords downtime to all employees affected by the relocation. However, I conclude also that the provision would afford downtime without regard to whether those employees' performances are, or likely would be, adversely affected by time spent on activities associated with the relocation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, I am unable to conclude that the Union intends its reference to matters that "affect" employee performance as encompassing only adverse effects. In this regard, the record reflects that, in a section which was not disapproved by the Agency head and which would immediately precede Provision 2 in the MOU, the parties agreed to require the Agency to give full and fair consideration to "factors adversely affecting performance as a result of the relocation." That this other, related provision is expressly limited to addressing adverse effects of the relocation supports an interpretation of Provision 2 as not encompassing such limitation. Moreover, there is no basis on which to conclude that it would be difficult for the Union to identify which employees are likely to suffer adverse effects from the relocation or to target those employees in the provision. As such, I find the provision distinguishable from Provision 4 in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span>, which a majority of the Authority found constituted an arrangement despite its prophylactic nature because, among other things, it was "impossible to determine reliably" which employees likely would suffer adverse effects. 49 FLRA at 191. Finally, the Union has not alleged or shown, and it is not otherwise apparent to me, that a failure to approve downtime for affected employees necessarily would adversely affect them. In fact, it appears reasonable to conclude that some of the employees encompassed by Provision 2 would, in fact, be entirely unaffected by such failure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I adhere to the view expressed by a majority of the Authority in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span> that, to constitute arrangements, proposals need not be so narrowly tailored in all cases as to benefit or compensate only those employees who would suffer an adverse effect as a result of an exercise of a management right. However, I find no circumstances in this case which justify a failure to expressly target adversely affected employees. I conclude, therefore, that Provision 2 is not sufficiently tailored and, as a result, does not constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As the provision directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work, it is nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.</span>, 49 FLRA 470 (1994) (Proposal 1) (Member Armendariz concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because arrangements proposals should address identifiable adverse effects upon reasonably identifiable populations of employees, unions must demonstrate particularity in their petitions and responses to justify proposals advanced as arrangements. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879 and DHHS, SSA, Dist. Office Oceanside</span>, 49 FLRA 279, 291 (1994), said of Provision 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the record does not disclose, other than in the most general terms, how the employees would be affected by the loss of adjudication time. The Union explains that when engaged in adjudication, a claims representative is removed from contact with claimants in order to review information and resolve claims. However, this explanation does not indicate what adverse consequences to the employees would flow from the unequal distribution of adjudication time. Thus, based on the record before us, we cannot determine how much of an employee's current workload is devoted to adjudication; how adjudication time is evaluated for performance appraisal purposes; and whether or to what extent management factors time spent on adjudication into its appraisals of claims processing work. Moreover, despite the Union's bare assertion that the Plan creates additional work assignments without compensating reductions in other assignments, we have no information about how work assignments were made before and after the implementation of the Plan, information that might assist us in determining the effect of additional adjudication time on an employee's ability to complete assigned claims processing work in the time allotted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the record in this case does not establish that this provision constitutes an arrangement for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of an arrangements proposal insufficiently tailored to workforce changes is <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-184 and VAMC Lexington</span>, 55 FLRA 549, 551-52 (1999). In response to an agency decision to replace licensed practical nurses with registered nurses in the emergency room and other components of the hospital, and to reassign the LPNs to other duties, the union proposed that the agency retain some of the LPNs in their positions, to be replaced through attrition. FLRA determined that the proposals were not sufficiently tailored to the changes made by management. They were overbroad: they encompassed employees who might not be adversely affected by the changes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">National <span id="page_596"></span>Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG). </span>Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See also United States Department of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v.

<p class="noindent-1">The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>As the Authority has explained, relying on <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, New Orleans, Louisiana v. FLRA,</span> 969 F.2d 1158, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1992), section 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain proposals that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National</span> <span class="Italic">Border Patrol Council and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1319 (1996). <span class="Italic">See also National Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local R14-23 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Commissary Agency, Kelly</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Base, Texas, </span>53 FLRA 1440, 1443 (1998) <span class="Italic">(Kelly Air Force Base).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union states that the LPNs who would be reassigned out of the walk-in clinic, emergency room and out-patient clinic would be assigned to new departments, some of which operate on a 24-hour basis. As a result, the Union claims that the LPNs might be required to work nights and weekends, with their established days off and annual leave schedules disrupted. The Union also states that LPNs assigned to different departments would work under different supervision and would have different duties. The Agency disputes the Union's claims that employees have been, or will be, adversely affected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the proposals are intended to be arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights, the Union has failed to show that the proposals are tailored to those employees who are, or are likely to be, adversely affected by the reassignments. For example, while the Union states that employees may now be required to work on weekends and evenings, many of the LPNs were subject to such work schedules prior to their reassignment. The proposals are not limited to the employees who were not previously subject to weekend and evening work. Similarly, the proposals are not addressed to employees whose daily work schedules and leave plans may be disturbed but would apply to employees who might not be affected in this manner. Finally, even if we were to find that assignment to different duties with different supervisors had some adverse consequences for some employees, the proposals would apply to all the reassigned LPNS, including those for whom a change in duties or supervision could be beneficial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the proposals are not sufficiently tailored. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 1164 and</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration,</span> <span class="Italic">District Office,</span> <span class="Italic">New Bedford, Massachusetts, </span>54 FLRA 1327, 1334-36, 1348-50 (1998) (even assuming there was increase in workload resulting from change in employee duties, proposals were not tailored to address those employees who would be assigned increased workload); <span class="Italic">Kelly Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base, </span>53 FLRA 1440 (proposal allowing temporarily disabled employee to decline work assignments to certain tours of duty not limited and, therefore, not sufficiently tailored to employees who would suffer scheduling problems the proposal was designed to address). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, </span>53 FLRA at 543-47 (proposal establishing time frame for removing letters of reprimand and oral admonishments confirmed in writing from employee files was tailored to compensate employees who might suffer more severe progressive disciplinary action if the letters were not removed).</p>
