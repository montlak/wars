<h3 class="h3" id="sec7-34"><span class="space">A.</span> GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Penalty review is a significant distinction between Board adjudication and labor arbitration. Although the Board is required to evaluate the unique circumstances of each case when it reviews an agency's penalty determination, <span class="Italic">Theisen v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 277, 279 (1986), the Board's position is very clear: it sustains an agency penalty unless the penalty is shown to be beyond the pale. Arbitrators tend to reduce severe penalties, particularly removals, unless mitigation is clearly inappropriate and management demonstrates severe misconduct warranting the penalty. The distinction is not lost on informed union officials, who avoid the Board in favor of arbitration of a disciplinary case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's long-standing analysis in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA,</span><a href="https://www.mspb.gov/netsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=253434&version=253721">, 5</a> <span class="blue">MSPR 280</span> 5 MSPB 313 (1981), discussed below, makes clear the Board's policy of deferring to agencies' selections of penalties. Many are the decisions expressing the Board's deferential approach toward agency penalty selection. <span class="Italic">Adam v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 492, 495 &#x00B6; 7 (2004), made the point that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not the Board's role to decide what penalty it would impose, but, rather, whether the penalty selected by the agency exceeds the maximum reasonable penalty<span class="Italic">. Lewis v. General Services Administration</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 259 &#x00B6; 5 (1999). In essence, the AJ weighed the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors differently than the agency. However, whether the AJ or the Board would have weighed the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors differently than the agency is not the issue in deciding whether to mitigate a penalty. The Board is not a super-personnel department. The issue in determining whether the Board should exercise its mitigation authority is whether the agency considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and reasonably exercised management discretion in making its penalty determination. We find that the agency did so here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Lateef v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 6 MSPR 664, 666, 6 MSPB 557 (1981) (rejecting as a standard of penalty review a "clear showing" of abuse of discretion or an "arbitrary and capricious" standard).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's deferential approach to agency penalty determination, assuming charges sustained by the facts found by the Board, was discussed in <span class="Italic">Norris v. SEC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120410137">675 F.3d 1349</a>, 1355-57 (Fed. Cir. 2012), involving an adverse action reviewed by an arbitrator (who is charged with applying the substantive law of the MSPB and Federal Circuit in an adverse action or performance-based removal or demotion case):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arbitrators, like the Board, must review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the merits of an agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee; i.e., the Board determines <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the underlying facts of the case such as whether the employee engaged in the alleged misconduct and whether the agency exceeded its authority in determining that the employee's misconduct would adversely affect the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 528 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">see Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 565 F.3d 1375, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The requirement of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review stems from the mandate that "the decision of the agency shall be sustained...only if the agency's decision...is supported by a preponderance of the evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1329.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The penalty question here involves a different standard of review from the merits determination; i.e., review is not <span class="Italic">de novo.</span> The "determination of an appropriate penalty is a matter committed primarily to the sound discretion of the employing agency." <span class="Italic">Brook</span>, 999 F.2d at 528 (quoting <span id="Page_2326"></span><span class="Italic">Beard v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Board's review is designed to determine whether the agency's action was reasonable, it can be argued that such a determination limits the Board's review to the evidence before the agency at the time of its decision. After all, a court's review of agency action to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious is typically limited to review of the agency record.[4] But we think that the Board's function is different from that of a reviewing court. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1), Congress required that the Board develop a new record. The Board must review the agency's action based on the new record. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1). In enacting this provision, Congress clearly contemplated that the new record would extend to all aspects of the case. "The Committee amended [&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(b)-(c)] to make it absolutely clear that an employee would receive a <span class="Italic">full evidentiary hearing</span> in any case where there is a dispute as to any genuine and material issue of fact...."

Given the Board's duty to conduct an independent assessment of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine the reasonableness of the penalty, <span class="Italic">see Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 332-33, we see no reason to distinguish between requiring the Board to consider new evidence relating to the agency's decision on the merits of the underlying misconduct and requiring the Board to consider new evidence regarding the reasonableness of the penalty imposed. Thus, we think new evidence, even on the question of penalty, should be considered by the Board (subject to the employee's right to notice of the basis for the removal described above).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's position is that "[t]he Board's role is not to displace the judgment of senior agency managers who must have confidence that employees--particularly those in a supervisory role--will act appropriately at all times." <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 103 MSPR 153, 157-58 &#x00B6; 13, 2006 MSPB 245 (2006). The Board's deference to the agency's penalty choice when all charges have been sustained is contrary to the approach taken by many labor arbitrators. In labor arbitration, employers are often required to establish that the penalty is the least severe necessary to correct the employee's behavior. Reasonable adherence to progressive discipline is the rule in arbitration; it is the exception in Board litigation. In arbitration and in some courts, removal is considered economic capital punishment. <span class="Italic">See VAMC, Long Beach v. FLRA</span>, 16 F.3d 1526 (9th Cir. 1994). In Board appeals, removal is <span class="Italic">de rigueur</span>. If the Board could adapt to progressive discipline, its adjudication would become less punitive, and arbitrators' caseloads would diminish.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Distilled, the Board's mitigation review in most appeals is to determine whether the penalty is unreasonable, not whether the penalty selected is the best one. <span class="Italic">See Pope v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 51, 54 (1994); <span class="Italic">Gardner v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 565, 571 (1990) ("An agency is only required to show that the penalty selected is reasonable--it is not required to show that the penalty selected is the best one available."). Neither the Board nor its reviewing court decides the penalty the agency should have chosen. Their duty is to decide if the agency selected a penalty within tolerable bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Riley v. USPS</span>, 34 Fed. Appx. 777, 780 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP). Deference by the Board to an agency penalty selection leaves intact the discretionary disciplinary power of a public sector employer. <span class="Italic">See Jolly v. Listerman</span>, 672 F.2d 935, 945 (D.C. Cir. 1982). When all charges are sustained, the Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency conscientiously considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. Only if the Board finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors, that the agency's judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness, or that fewer than all of the charges against the employee can be sustained is it appropriate for the Board then to specify how the agency decision should be corrected to bring the penalty within the parameters of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 42 MSPR 644, 647 (1989), and <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 521, 524 (1996). The agency is not required to prove the propriety of a particular penalty by a preponderance of the evidence. Recognizing that the selection of the appropriate penalty is a distinct element of the agency's decision, the agency's burden is to show that its penalty struck a responsible balance within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Dennehy v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 31, 34 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">During its review, the Board is not limited to the record before the agency; it will consider all relevant factors, including mitigating circumstances argued to the Board but not addressed to the agency following the adverse action proposal. <span class="Italic">See Hall v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 8 MSPR 347, 355 (1981). The agency has some flexibility as well.

<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency is not required to use progressive discipline under this subpart. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances. In making a determination regarding the appropriate penalty for an instance of misconduct, an agency shall adhere to the standard of proposing and imposing a penalty that is within the bounds of tolerable reasonableness. Within the agency, a proposed penalty is in the sole and exclusive discretion of a proposing official, and a penalty decision is in the sole and exclusive discretion of the deciding official. Penalty decisions are subject to appellate or other review procedures prescribed in law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Employees should be treated equitably. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time. An agency should consider appropriate comparators as the agency evaluates a potential disciplinary action. Appropriate comparators to be considered are primarily individuals in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, who engaged in the same or similar misconduct. Proposing and deciding officials are not bound by previous decisions in earlier similar cases, but should, as they deem appropriate, consider such decisions consonant with their own managerial authority and responsibilities and independent judgment. For example, a supervisor is not bound by his or her predecessor whenever there is similar conduct. A minor indiscretion for one supervisor based on a particular set of facts can amount to a more serious offense under a different supervisor. Nevertheless, they should be able to articulate why a more or less severe penalty is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Among other relevant factors, agencies should consider an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all applicable prior misconduct, when taking an action under this subpart.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;A suspension should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate.

<p class="Body-Text">Although the approaches toward penalty selection in Board litigation and arbitration differ considerably, mitigation should not be ignored in a Board appeal. Discovery provides an excellent means to develop evidence of disparate or discriminatory penalties to support a related mitigation defense. Each of the mitigation factors discussed in this chapter may assist in salvaging a client's career if evidence in support of mitigation is properly elucidated. Agency counsel should take care that when adverse actions are in the proposal and decision stages, managers consider mitigating factors and articulate those factors in the final decision letters they issue. The factors must also be articulated during the hearing if agency deciding officials are called upon to testify. Careful consideration of mitigating factors and articulation of that consideration will serve to convince the Board and a reviewing court that the agency takes its disciplinary responsibilities seriously and imposes discipline reasonably.
