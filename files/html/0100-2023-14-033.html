<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-34"><span class="space">3.</span> Impermissible Arrangements</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal for a schedule of six workweeks followed by four weeks off, or, alternatively, an equal time off for that worked, was incompatible with the Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982, 5 USC 6120 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Under that Act, employees may not accumulate more than 24 hours of credit (time that can reduce the next biweekly pay period). Additionally, the proposal did not fit within the definition of a compressed schedule established by the Act. <span class="Italic">Maritime/Metal Trades Council and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 18 FLRA 326, 337 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under a compressed workweek program, the union sought to negotiate a standard of reasonableness concerning the timing of days off, but FLRA concluded it was an impermissible proposal. It allowed an arbitrator to substitute his judgment for that of the agency in deciding when to assign work to the employees needed to perform agency work that required regular meetings with other employees and agency officials. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 204 and FEC</span>, 19 FLRA 234, 236-37 (1985). A proposal was not subject to negotiation that required the agency to permit employees to be absent, without regard to the need for their presence, as long as a certain percentage, based on past practice, of absent workers was not exceeded. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 65 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 20 FLRA 35, 38 (1985). A proposal was nonnegotiable that prevented management from suspending flextime for employees attending training. It limited the ability of the agency to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA, Northeast Program Serv. Ctr.</span>, 9 FLRA 1025, 1026 (1982). Proposals are nonnegotiable that delegate to specific personnel the responsibility for determining work schedules of employees. They infringe the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R12-167 and Office of Adjutant Gen., California</span>, 27 FLRA 349, 355 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA distinguished compressed and flexible work schedules. The two could not be mixed as "hybrid" arrangements, <span class="Italic">GSA, Washington and NFFE</span>, 50 FLRA 136, 137-39 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During negotiations for a local agreement, the Respondent notified the Union that it would no longer honor the first sentence of Article 34, section 6B of the parties' master agreement.[2] Relying in part on Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Chapter 610, Subchapter 4 [3], the Respondent asserted that the sentence violated the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982 (the Work Schedules Act), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6120-6133 (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993), which, according to the Respondent, does not permit a combined flexible-compressed work schedule (hereinafter a "hybrid" schedule).[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Article 34, section 6B provides as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Employees may combine the 5/4/9 schedule with the flexible schedule under this agreement. Employees may arrive at work any time during the morning flexible band and depart after completing their required number of hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;During the pendency of this case, FPM Chapter 610 was abolished. FPM Sunset Document, Summary Table at 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;As used herein, a flexible schedule permits employees to vary starting and quitting times during the days of a biweekly pay period; a compressed schedule permits employees to work the required number of hours in fewer days than normal in a pay period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed sentence of Article 34, section 6B authorizes employees to combine compressed and flexible work schedules. Based on our examination of the Act and its legislative history, we find that the Act separately defines and authorizes flexible and compressed schedules, and that the two types of schedules have different requirements with respect to such matters as overtime, holidays, and night pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the Work Schedules Act is silent with respect to combining the two schedules.&#x2003;On the basis of these findings and the responsibility delegated to OPM to prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of flexible and compressed work schedules established under the Act, we adopt OPM's interpretation of the Act as prohibiting such combination. <span class="Italic">See generally Chevron U.S.A.

<p class="noindent-1">The parties' maxiflex provision allows employees to set their schedules with varying start and stop times and hours per workweek, consistent with the definition of a flexible work schedule in the Act and OPM guidance. And, although Article 16 includes two examples of schedules in which an employee cannot vary the hours each workweek, which is consistent with the statutory definition of a compressed work schedule,[27] it also includes sample maxiflex schedules that are inconsistent with that definition.[28] Therefore, the record does not support the Union's argument that the parties' maxiflex schedule is a "compressed work schedule" or that the Arbitrator erred in finding that it created a hybrid schedule.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find nonnegotiable a proposal--that would allow employees on a flexible schedule to earn credit hours for hours worked on a federal holiday during the same duty hours for which the employee is already being paid holiday pay--because it conflicts with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6121(4) and applicable Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The proposal at issue here has been included in the parties' agreement since 2012 and was disputed during their last contract negotiation in 2015.[2] The Agency declared the proposal non-negotiable during reopener negotiations in 2018 when the article was reopened for bargaining.</p>

An arbitrator agreed and ruled that the provision violated &#x00A7; 5546.

<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wording</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other than employees on Maxiflex schedules, employees will be allowed to earn a maximum of three (3) credit hours per regularly scheduled workday and up to ten (10) credit hours on regular non-workdays (e.g., Saturday and Sunday for a Monday to Friday workweek). <span class="Italic">Federal holidays are considered non-workdays for the purpose of earning credit hours.</span> Subject to prior approval by the Employer and established flexible time bands, credit hours may be earned at the beginning of the shift, the end of the shift, or split between the beginning and the end of the shift.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.<span class="Italic">Meaning</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the conference, the parties agreed that, as described in the petition, the proposal would allow employees on flexible schedules to earn credit hours, on federal holidays, during the same hours as the employee's normal tour of duty. Employees on flexible schedules could "work up to ten (10) credit hours on [f]ederal holidays." The parties agreed that the proposal would operate as set forth in the Union's petition. As an example, the Union explained that "if the employee's normal tour of duty is from 8:00 <span class="small-d">A.M</span>. to 4:30 <span class="small-d">P.M</span>., the proposal would permit the employee to elect to work credit hours during that same timeframe" on a federal holiday. The parties agree that the issue in this petition is whether employees are precluded from voluntarily working credit hours on a federal holiday <span class="Italic">during the same hours</span> used to meet the employees' basic work requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C.<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The proposal is non-negotiable</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal is non-negotiable because it violates the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act (the Act)[11] and OPM's interpretative guidance.[12] The Agency contends that because the eight holiday hours are used to account for the employee's basic work requirement, hours voluntarily worked during that <span class="Italic">same time period</span>, the same tour of duty,[13] cannot logically constitute credit hours, in light of the definitions in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6121 and 6124.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Any analysis must begin with the text of the Act.[14] Section 6121(4) defines "credit hours" to mean: "any hours, within a flexible schedule established under section 6122 of this title, which are in excess of an employee's basic work requirement and which the employee elects to work so as to vary the length of a workweek or a workday."[15] The term "basic work requirement" is also defined in &#x00A7; 6121(3) of the Act as: "the number of hours, excluding overtime hours, which an employee is required to work or is required to account for by leave or otherwise."[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the entitlement of employees on flexible work schedules to eight hours of pay for holidays is provided for in &#x00A7; 6124, which states in relevant part: "if any employee on a flexible schedule under section 6122 of this title is relieved or prevented from working on a day designated as a holiday by Federal statute or Executive order, such employee is entitled to pay with respect to that day for [eight] hours."[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 6124.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The text of the Act does not clearly address the very narrow issue before us, namely, whether credit hours may be earned by eligible employees on a federal holiday during the very tour of duty, the same hours, for which those employees are (already) being paid their eight hours of holiday pay.[18] However, within &#x00A7; 6121's definition of "credit hours," the phrase "in excess" that modifies "the employee's basic work requirement" is key--it indicates that it must be additional time.[19] The Union cites the Act's legislative history for support of its interpretation that by definition, employees may "earn credit hours on a holiday during <span class="Italic">any</span> hours within their flexible time band, including the hours that the employee would have normally worked but for the holiday."[20] To the contrary, we find the cited historical comment equally ambiguous because it largely repeats the enacted definition of credit hours. Moreover, the Agency has already conceded that an employee may earn credit hours on a holiday--the issue before us is <span class="Italic">when</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18] Equally unavailing is &#x00A7; 6126(a) of the Act, which provides that "[s]ubject to any limitation prescribed by [OPM] or the agency, a full-time employee on a flexible schedule can accumulate...credit hours." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6126(a).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Title 5, &#x00A7; 6133 of the U.S. Code grants OPM authority to prescribe regulations and provide educational guidance on the Act.[22] The parties did not identify any government-wide regulations implementing the Act that shed needed light here; accordingly, we turn to the available guidance as issued by OPM.[23] While OPM has not issued guidance that carries the force of law, we nonetheless find the assorted letters of instruction that accompanied the Presidents' executive orders, read with the <span class="Italic">Handbook on Alternative Work Schedules</span> and the available "Factsheet" to be persuasive because cumulatively they are a reasonable interpretation of the Act.[24]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Of record are three OPM Transmittals, dated in 2012, 2014, and 2015, that are letters from the OPM Director to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies.[25] Each Transmittal was a memorandum that instructed federal executive agencies on the implementation of an accompanying executive order that allowed eligible federal employees to be excused from duty, without charge to leave, for certain dates that immediately accompanied an already established federal holiday. In the Transmittals, the OPM Director informed these agencies how to treat the identified dates as, in effect, additional holidays. The Transmittal for the 2015 half-day holiday, in addition to the 2014 and 2012 memoranda, provide that employees may earn credit hours for work performed "in excess" of the basic work requirement, and not in lieu of any premium pay.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Transmittals refer to the OPM <span class="Italic">Handbook on Alternative Work Schedules</span> for further guidance.[27] The Handbook discusses how the 80 hours of the "basic work requirement" must be worked or otherwise accounted for.[28] It provides that employees are to be credited with eight hours toward their basic work requirement when they are excused from work during a federal holiday. As we observed in an analogous case, <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 41</span>, credit hours are defined as "outside" of the basic work requirement.[29] Therefore, <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 41</span>, supports the Agency's argument here that credit hours cannot be earned simultaneously with holiday pay, for the regular tour of duty that is used to make up the 80-hour basic work requirement, because credit hours are supposed to be outside of the basic work requirement. Both the Transmittals and the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> refer to the Fact Sheet for additional guidance.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the OPM Fact Sheet: <span class="Italic">Credit Hours Under a Flexible Work Schedule</span> addresses the <span class="Italic">when</span> for earning credit hours. After observing credit hours may only be earned within the flexible time band as already established by an agency or parties' agreement, the Fact Sheet states: "Hours that will count toward the basic work requirement may not be considered credit hours."[30] The Fact Sheet also addresses whether employees may earn or use credit hours on holidays. The Fact Sheet provides that employees may not earn additional credit hours "during holiday hours" and that employees may earn credit hours for work "in excess" of their basic work requirement on a holiday.[31] Therefore, located in the Fact Sheet is the guidance that credit hours may not be earned simultaneously, or within the same tour of duty, as holiday hours that fulfill the basic work requirement.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The cumulative weight of the OPM guidance of record is persuasive that, under the Act, eligible, flexible schedule employees may not use the same hours that count toward their basic work requirement to earn credit hours. While alternative work schedules are generally negotiable, they are subject to limitation.[32] Here, the Union's proposal conflicts with OPM's guidance as the proposal would allow employees to earn credit hours during <span class="Italic">the same holiday hours</span> that count toward their basic work requirement. But the proposal cannot be reconciled with the Act's definition of credit hours--that time cannot be both simultaneous to, <span class="Italic">and "in excess" of</span>, the basic work requirement.[33] Accordingly, we find that the Union's proposal is non-negotiable and dismiss the Union's petition.</p>
