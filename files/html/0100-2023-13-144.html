<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-143"><span class="space">4.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Respondeat Superior</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Disciplinary action is normally imposed for personal misconduct. What of persons who arguably are responsible for the misconduct of others? Supervisors are responsible for the conduct of others but cannot be expected to assume complete responsibility, for disciplinary purposes, for every act of every subordinate. The Board states that the doctrine of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span>, imposing liability on an employer for the negligent actions of its employees committed within the scope of employment, is inapplicable to public officers and their subordinates who are likewise in the public service. But an employee can be responsible for the improprieties of his subordinates if he actually directed or had knowledge of and acquiesced in their misconduct. The employee who should have had knowledge of subordinates' misconduct is at risk as well. In applying the "knowledge and acquiescence" standard, some factors to be considered include: the knowledge a supervisor has, or should have, of the conduct of subordinates; the existence of policies or practices within the supervisor's agency or division relating to the offending conduct; the extent that the supervisor encouraged or acquiesced in those practices; the number of employees involved in the improprieties relative to the total number of employees in the work unit; and the supervisor's length of service in the supervisory position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Determination of a supervisor's responsibility requires balancing several factors. The greater the supervisor's duty to control those employees who actually committed the improprieties, the less specific knowledge of the misconduct the supervisor must have. If the supervisor has direct control over the employees committing the violation, the supervisor's general knowledge of relevant factors imposes an affirmative duty to investigate further. Because the agency must prove each element of its charges, it must demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence the knowledge of the supervisor charged with allowing improprieties by subordinates. If some but not all charges are sustained against a supervisor with an otherwise good service record, and no evidence exists that the supervisor gained financially from any wrongdoing of the subordinates, an appropriate penalty for the errant supervisor is downgrading to a nonsupervisory position rather than removal. <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MILLER_SF07528110019_OPINION_AND_ORDER_254470.pdf">8 MSPR 249</a>, 7 MSPB 713 (1981)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the Board mitigated the removal of a program manager to assignment to a nonsupervisory position. <span class="Italic">Miller</span> explained the basis for its assessment of the manager's culpability for the errors and omissions of employees under his authority, 8 MSPR at 251-53:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The action of removal was based upon five general charges which were stated by the agency as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Repeated instances in which you created the appearance of giving preferential treatment to various individuals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;Repeated instances in which you caused or created the appearance of impeding government efficiency and economy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Repeated instances in which you created the appearance of affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the integrity of the Government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;Actions which created the appearance of losing complete independence or impartiality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.&#x2003;Failure to discharge your supervisory responsibilities in a manner which maintained and demonstrated high standards of conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency set forth numerous alleged examples in support of the above noted charges in its notice of proposed removal as well as its ultimate removal notice. The examples were taken from six incidents which took place during the period in issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was generally not charged with personally taking improper actions, but rather with allowing a situation to exist in which his subordinates acted improperly. Such actions were then approved by appellant. As the official who, for the most part, had final authority to award and approve the award of grant funds within his region to various grantees, the agency contended that appellant was ultimately responsible for improprieties discovered in such awards. Among the improprieties noted by the agency were the utilization of the grant process to circumvent competitive procurements by preselecting consultants to be utilized as the recipients of grants; the use of an individual whose services were paid for by a grantee as an agency employee; and the preselection by the agency employees of a consulting firm as the actual recipient of a grant, with the named grantee simply "passing through" or "holding" grant funds for the benefit of the preselected <span class="Italic">de facto</span> recipient, in such a manner as to circumvent any meaningful chance for competition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official analyzed at great length each of the six incidents upon which the charges were based, and sustained three charges relating to one incident and four charges relating to another. While holding that based upon the record as a whole "the sustained charges certainly warrant some form of disciplinary action," the presiding official determined that the agency had not established that appellant's removal would promote the efficiency of the service based upon the sustained charges standing alone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the charges against appellant involve the appearance of improper conduct rather than such conduct itself, and failure to properly supervise subordinates who had engaged in improprieties. Since the doctrine of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> is not applicable,[1] appellant cannot be held responsible for the improprieties of his subordinates unless he actually directed or had knowledge of and acquiesced in the misconduct. In applying the "knowledge and acquiescence" standard,[2] courts have considered the following factors: the knowledge a supervisor has, or should have, of the conduct of subordinates; the existence of policies or practices within the supervisor's agency or division which relate to the offending conduct; and the extent to which the supervisor has encouraged or acquiesced in these practices and/or subordinates' misconduct. Experience in personnel matters dictates that other factors may be relevant in determining liability. These factors include: the number of employees involved in the improprieties in relation to the total number of employees in the work unit and the supervisor's length of service in the supervisory position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The doctrine of <span class="Italic">respondeat superior</span> imposes liability upon an employer for the negligent acts of his employees committed within the scope of employment. The doctrine has no application as between public officers and their subordinates who are likewise in the public service. <span class="Italic">Holt v. Bowie,</span> 333 F. Supp. 843, 846 (W. D. Virginia 1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Santiago v. City of Philadelphia</span>, 435 F. Supp. 136, 151 (E.D. Pa. 1977); <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Bracey v. Grenoble,</span> 494 F.2d 566, 571 (3d Cir. 1974); <span class="Italic">United States ex rel.</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Prasse,</span> 408 F. Supp. 988, 991 (E.D. Pa. 1976). These cases involve the question of a supervisor's responsibility for the misconduct of subordinates where a plaintiff has suffered a constitutional deprivation due to the misconduct of such subordinates. Although not totally on point, the cases provide criteria to look to in determining supervisors' liabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not all of these factors will be pertinent in every case, and the determination of a supervisor's liability must involve a balancing of the relevant factors. However, the greater the duty a supervisor has to control those employees who actually committed the improprieties, the less specific knowledge of the misconduct the supervisor will be required to have. Where it has been shown that the supervisor has direct control over the employees committing the violation, the supervisor's general knowledge of relevant factors imposes an affirmative duty to investigate further.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant was charged with the responsibility to exercise final and all but exclusive control over the award of grants in his region. He supervised a small staff, many of whom were involved in the improprieties at issue, and all of whom were in direct and constant <span id="Page_2191"></span>contact with appellant. The degree of specific knowledge of factors from which improper conduct of appellant's subordinates might be inferred or from which a duty to inquire would arise should be slight indeed. Yet, following a review of the agency's petition for review and the record in this appeal, we find that the presiding official correctly determined that as to those incidents relating to charges which were not sustained the agency failed to establish even such minimal knowledge as would put appellant on notice of wrongdoing, impute such knowledge to him, or cause him to inquire further.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Powell v. USPS</span>, 122 MSPR 60, 64-65 &#x00B6; 8, 2014 MSPB 89 (2014), applied <span class="Italic">Miller</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument, in essence, is that he should not be held responsible for the improprieties of his subordinates. However, the appellant was not charged with allowing a situation to exist in which his subordinates acted improperly; he was charged with personally taking improper actions.[2] The appellant has acknowledged seeing that the APMEX mail had yet to be processed when there were only minutes left to do so. Nevertheless, he did not process the APMEX mail himself, direct the clerk to process it, or take any other action to ensure its timely dispatch. Accordingly, the appellant failed to follow the proper instruction to ensure that all outgoing mail received during the day is placed onto the last dispatch truck or otherwise taken to the plant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;It should be noted that even if the charge brought against the appellant was as he characterized it, the Board has long held that under certain conditions, a supervisor may be held accountable for the misconduct of his subordinates, even without specific knowledge of the misconduct, which is present in the instant case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Miller v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 249, 251-53 (1981) (discussing the standard for holding a supervisor responsible for the improprieties of his or her subordinates).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another factor to be considered is the subject matter expertise distributed within the chain of command. An employee was demoted and suspended when, as housing director, he failed to ensure that a grantee's application was properly processed by subordinates. He claimed in defense that if he was responsible, so was the area manager, who was his supervisor. Unpersuaded, the Board concluded that the appellant was responsible for a program that required considerable expertise; the area manager was a generalist with responsibility for many programs. The area manager, not being a subject matter expert and not having knowledge of any improprieties, did not share appellant's responsibility for the improper processing of the grantee's application. The Board concluded there was no inappropriate disparity in the imposition of adverse action against the housing director but none against the area manager. <span class="Italic">Mayfield v.

Therefore, while it may have been common practice to conduct the OC Contamination training in the manner in which the appellant conducted it, the evidence and testimony indicates that he did not conduct the training in accordance with his on-the-job training.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Respondeat superior</span> was revisited in <span class="Italic">Mauro v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 86, 91, 93 (1987), involving charges that a fourth-line supervisor managing over 400 employees and 32 facilities should have uncovered financial or accounting improprieties of subordinates. The Board reiterated its adherence to <span class="Italic">Miller</span>: (1) that an appellant cannot be held responsible for the improprieties of his subordinate employees unless he actually directed or had knowledge of and acquiesced in the misconduct, and (2) that the greater the duty a supervisor has to control those employees who actually committed the improprieties, the less the specific knowledge of the misconduct the supervisor will be required to have. For discipline to be properly supported, there must have been some communication of problems to the higher-level manager. This communication should be established either through the managerial chain of command or outside the chain of command. A factor to be considered is whether the agency, through the proposal or decision notices or through the testimony of the appellant's supervisor, suggested either a specific failure on appellant's part or steps that he should have taken earlier to prevent the problems described. The Board will also consider whether subordinate managers who should have advised the appellant about the problems in operations were disciplined or removed from their positions. Under <span class="Italic">Mauro</span>, if the agency takes no action against employees who had an affirmative obligation to inform the appellant concerning operational problems but failed to do so, it may not reasonably take action against the appellant for failure to do what others were charged with performing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a supervisor will not be considered to have been involved in improper actions of subordinates if he took no active role in them, he is held accountable to monitor their activities. Concerning a supervisor accused of failing to report leave abuse, the Board would look not to isolated incidents, but rather to the size and location of the work force, agency policy, and the experience of the supervisor. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 518, 521, 10 MSPB 445 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mauro</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. A third-level supervisor was disciplined (with a mitigated penalty) for failing to ensure that lower-level supervisors followed safety instructions. <span class="Italic">Mealy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 187, 191 (1987). A postmaster suffered a demotion because of inadequate financial supervision of an office. <span class="Italic">Cavanaugh v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 670, 674 (1987). But an appellant should not have been disciplined after he followed proper procedures upon a report from a subordinate concerning a matter within the subordinate's province. The appellant was not at fault for the subordinate's failure to make a proper report of the events. <span class="Italic">Bashaw v. DOJ</span>, 39 MSPR 670, 675-76 (1989). A personnel officer, the Board strongly implied, could be implicated in a subordinate's prohibited personnel practices resulting in interference with proper selection procedures if the superior knew of, but failed to correct, the improper practices. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ross</span>, 34 MSPR 197, 203 n.8 (1987). Closely connected with the <span class="Italic">Miller</span> analysis is the concept expressed in <span class="Italic">Jacob v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 277, 279 n.5 (1984), that an admission by an appellant that his supervision was negligent differs from an admission of a charge of commission of a work error; the difference is the distinction between a charge of personally taking improper action and a charge of allowing a subordinate to act improperly.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering the duty of an SES employee to monitor activities within an organization, and applying <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, two executives in two regions of GSA were not responsible for, and should not have been disciplined for, excessive spending at an agency conference hosted and managed by a different regional office. The problems with the conference led to national publicity, resignation of the GSA Administrator, and resignation or discharge of some high level appointees. But as to the appellants, who had no direct connection to the funding or significant operational details or excesses of the conference, in <span class="Italic">Prouty &#x0026; Weller v. GSA</span>, 122 MSPR 117, 125-28, 132-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-20, 30-32, 35-37, 2014 MSPB 90 (2014), adverse action was unjustified:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we recently pointed out in <span class="Italic">Powell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2014 MSPB 89, the Board in Miller determined that a supervisor cannot be held responsible for the improprieties of subordinate employees unless he actually directed or had knowledge of and acquiesced in the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. at 252. In applying the "knowledge and acquiescence" standard, the Board in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> considered the following factors: (1) the knowledge the supervisor has, or should have, of the conduct of subordinates; (2) the existence of policies or practices within the supervisor's agency or division which relate to the offending conduct; and (3) the extent to which the supervisor has encouraged or acquiesced in these practices and/or the subordinates' misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 252-53. The Board stated in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> that, "[t]he greater the duty a supervisor has to control those employees who actually committed the improprieties, the less specific knowledge of the misconduct the supervisor will be required to have. Where it has been shown that the supervisor has direct control over the employees committing the violation, the supervisor's general knowledge of relevant factors imposes an affirmative duty to investigate further." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 253.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first note that, importantly, neither notice of proposed removal alleges that the appellants engaged in misconduct because of a failure to perform a heightened duty to investigate and inquire. As the administrative judge in Prouty correctly determined, there are two parts to each specification--that the appellant in fact knew of the "questionable and excessive expenditures" in connection with the WRC and thus engaged in misconduct personal to him, or that he should have known about "the questionable and excessive expenditures" and acted to prevent them from occurring. The Board is required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; the Board may not substitute on its own what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989). We therefore may not consider in the context <span id="Page_2192"></span>of these appeals whether the appellants' status as members of the SES lessens or otherwise affects the agency's burden of proving the specific allegations in its misconduct charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the agency contends that the administrative judges failed to consider its position that the appellants should have known about the questionable and excessive expenditures because they had an affirmative duty to inquire and investigate. This assertion, that the administrative judges did not adequately consider this argument, is inaccurate. In fact, for each of the specifications, the administrative judges first thoroughly reviewed the record evidence to determine whether the agency established its allegation that the appellants in fact knew of the activities at issue and then considered whether the agency established that the appellants should have known of the alleged misconduct. In so proceeding, the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Prouty</span> specifically considered the agency's arguments, taking into consideration that the SES is a corps of elite federal managers held to a very high standard of conduct, and, in each instance, she determined that the agency failed to establish that an affirmative duty to investigate was "triggered." Under these circumstances, the agency has failed to persuade us that the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Prouty</span> erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Miller</span> or that the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Weller</span> erred in applying those concepts to reach his result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated, we agree with the administrative judges that applying <span class="Italic">Miller</span> and/or its concepts to the facts of these cases does not result in a finding that the appellants are guilty of the wrongdoing as charged in connection with the 2010 WRC. However, it is clear that, in other situations, <span class="Italic">Miller</span> can be relied upon as a basis for agencies to hold supervisors liable for improprieties engaged in by their subordinates. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of the Navy</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 518, 521 (1982) (supervisory employee was properly held accountable for ignoring repeated blatant leave abuse by his subordinates under circumstances in which the employee should have known of the acts of his subordinates, aside from an alleged lack of uniformity within the agency in reporting leave during the relevant time frame). As the administrative judge in Prouty found, application of the "knowledge and acquiescence" standard under <span class="Italic">Miller</span> requires consideration and a balancing of a number of factors which, under certain circumstances, will render supervisors responsible for the misconduct of their subordinates. The fact that the agency here did not meet the standard regarding these appellants in no way suggests that agencies may not, in other situations, rely upon <span class="Italic">Miller</span> to hold supervisors responsible for the misdeeds of their employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petitions for review, the agency cites <span class="Italic">Dolezal v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 64, 72 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 22 F.3d 1104 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), as support for its position that members of the SES are held to a higher standard. It is true, as the agency contends, that the Board in <span class="Italic">Dolezal</span> declared that the appellant must be "held to a higher standard of conduct because of his SES status and because his position made him [the Command's] highest-ranking personnel policy maker, and one of a handful of the highest-ranking personnel officers in the entire agency." 58 M.S.P.R. at 72. That said, the misconduct of the SES appellant in <span class="Italic">Dolezal</span> was wholly different from that alleged in these cases. In addition, the Board in <span class="Italic">Dolezal</span> did not need to, and therefore did not, address any specific duty on the part of SES members to investigate wrongdoing by their subordinates and so does not advance the agency's cause. Notwithstanding, the overarching principle expressed in <span class="Italic">Dolezal</span> to the effect that members of the SES, because of their status, are held to a higher standard of conduct remains valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We likewise find that the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Baracker v. Department of the Interior</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 594 (1996), is misplaced. Again, it is true, as the agency argues, that the Board in <span class="Italic">Baracker</span> held that "the SES is a corps of elite Federal managers held to a very high standard of conduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 602. The Board also cautioned in that case that SES employees could not be "insulated from discipline for behavior that would constitute actionable misconduct" in every instance, merely because it was "committed by a lower-graded employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nonetheless, our holding in <span class="Italic">Baracker</span> does not, as the agency seems to suggest here, endorse the idea that an agency may relinquish its obligation to prove charges against an SES employee solely on the basis of his or her status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the second specification, the agency contends on review, as it did below, that appellant Weller's participation at the conference itself placed him on notice of the lavish nature of what was provided and should have caused him to realize that per diem rates had been exceeded. As the administrative judge correctly noted, however, this aspect of the agency's charge, while referenced in its decision letter, was not expressly included in the appellant's notice of proposed removal. Thus, it was not appropriately considered as part of the charge. <span class="Italic">See Gottlieb</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. at 609.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends with respect to this specification that the administrative judge erred in failing to find that, had appellant Weller exercised his duty to inquire and inform himself, he would have learned that these expenditures were improper. The agency fails to cite any evidence or authority concerning the source or scope of such a duty. Further, the agency does not dispute the administrative judge's determination that the contract arrangements for the food and beverages served at the WRC were exclusively performed by employees of Region 9, that appellant Weller was not privy to this contracting process, and that he did not know what the government was actually charged for any of the catering arrangements at the WRC. Under these circumstances, we find no basis in the agency's petition for review for disturbing the administrative judge's determination that it failed to establish this specification. <span class="Italic">See Yang</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">see also Broughton</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 359.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to specification 3, the agency contends on review, as it did below, that appellant Weller is responsible, as a senior executive, for the actions or inactions of the employees he appointed to serve as representatives from Region 7, who became aware during the various planning meetings that at least some of these items would be procured for the WRC, and that he should either have kept sufficiently apprised via communication with these employees, or he should have ensured that they possessed the requisite knowledge to determine whether such purchases were permissible. The agency provides no basis, however, for disturbing the administrative judge's determination that appellant Weller selected these employees as planning representatives, and not for their knowledge of federal acquisition rules or to troubleshoot whether Region 9 was complying with them, and that it was the understanding of all involved that contract and procurement decisions for the WRC were to be made by Region 9, which remained solely responsible for them. Accordingly, the agency's contentions in this regard do not provide a basis for disturbing the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that the agency's petitions for review provide no basis to disturb the administrative judges' well-supported findings and ultimate conclusions that the agency failed to establish its charges. There can be no doubt that the decisions that were made in the planning and carrying out of the 2010 WRC reflect a disregard of economy and a level of extravagance that have no place in government. However the agency, by abandoning its duty to produce evidence in support of its charges against the appellants, as the administrative judges found, simply did not prove that these particular appellants knew or had reason to know of these ill-advised planning and purchasing decisions until after the conference had concluded, at which time no action on their part would have been effective. We have set forth in this decision any number of matters upon which the agency failed to meet its burden of proof. For example, the agency failed to submit into the record most of the evidence underlying the OIG's conclusions, any evidence as to the actual costs and expenses for employees' attendance at the dry run, any evidence that appellant Prouty or any Region 8 employee was involved in procuring food for the conference, any evidence that appellant Prouty knew that Region 9 engaged in improper procurement and contracting activities, any evidence showing that the number of conference attendees from Region 7 was excessive, and any evidence that appellant Weller was involved in procuring food for the conference. We do not speculate as to what the result might have been had the agency submitted sufficient evidence in support of its charges. We find only that it failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have clearly held in the past, members of the SES, managers, and supervisors may be held responsible for the misdeeds of their subordinate employees, where appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hanna v. Department of Labor</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 294 (1998) (finding that demotion was an appropriate penalty for a supervisor charged with not complying with the agency's policies and, even worse, encouraging his subordinates to do the same), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 18 Fed. Appx. 787 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Similarly, as we have explained above, the principles of <span class="Italic">Miller</span> remain applicable for this purpose in public sector cases, particularly where it is shown that supervisors have direct control over the employees committing the violation. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. at 253. Agencies need not leave this to chance. They may include such managerial obligations in the position descriptions of supervisors, even SES supervisors, to make clear the extent of their responsibility over the actions of their subordinates. No change in statute is necessary to enhance the responsibilities of members of the SES or other managers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the record and the agency's arguments before us, we are constrained to agree with the administrative judges' decisions to reverse these removal actions.</p>
