<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-37"><span class="space">b.</span> Proposal to List Aggravating Factors; Treatment of Warnings; Due Process Considerations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 304:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">aggravating factors on which the agency intends to rely for imposition of an enhanced penalty, such as a prior disciplinary record, should be included in the advance notice of charges so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those alleged factors before the agency's deciding official,[65] and the decision notice should explain what weight was given to those factors in reaching the agency's final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[65]&#x2003;Since 5 C.F.R. 752.404(f) forbids the agency from considering any reason not specified in the advance notice of proposed action, agencies must consider in preparing the advance notice required by Section 7513(b)(1) all of the factors on which they intend to rely in any consequent decision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Albert v. Chafee</span>, 571 F.2d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Iannarelli v. Morton</span>, 327 F. Supp. 873, 882 (E.D. Pa. 1971), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 463 F.2d 179 (3d Cir. 1972). Of course, this does not require designation in the notices of all circumstances that could conceivably be relevant to the penalty; for example, if an appellant contends that a penalty exceeds that imposed upon other employees in like circumstances, the agency would remain free to present evidence to rebut such contention notwithstanding its failure to have recited such information in its advance or final notices. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cafferello v. Civil Service Commission</span>, 625 F.2d 285, 288 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interpreting <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> footnote 65<span class="Italic">, Phillips v. GSA,</span> 38 MSPR 206, 213-14 (1988), offered a qualified comment concerning the effect of a deciding official's consideration (without the appellant's knowledge) of what amounted to a penalty analysis prepared by the proposing official that included adverse information not contained in the proposal notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While it is true that an agency may not consider any reasons not specified in the advance notice of proposed action, it is not required to designate all circumstances that could conceivably be relevant to the penalty. [citing <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, at 304, n.65] Moreover, the record in this case does not suggest that the agency relied on these factors to impose an enhanced penalty, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 304, since the agency Table of Penalties allows removal for a second offense of insubordination. In addition, it is clear from the agency's decision letter that the major factor in the decision to effect the appellant's removal was the fact was that her position was one that required a special relationship of trust and confidence, which, it was felt, had been irreparably damaged by her actions....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> would likely be different based upon more recent decisions, e.g., <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, involving improper consideration of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information or communications. [Refer to Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-106.html#sec11-107">Information Pertaining to Aggravation or Mitigation of Penalty; <span class="Italic">Ward</span></a><span class="Italic">."</span>]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"It is error for an agency to rely on matters affecting the penalty it imposes without including those matters in the proposal notice." <span class="Italic">Von Muller v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 101 MSPR 91, 100 &#x00B6; 20, 2006 MSPB 18 (2006). As a general rule, aggravating factors should be included in both the advance notice of charges and the agency decision notice. <span class="Italic">See Howard v.

<p class="Body-Text">It is of no significance whether the information, unknown to the appellant, that influences the deciding official comes to the deciding official from external sources, e.g., a supervisor or manager or witness, or whether the information relied upon is simply known to the deciding official from his or her acquaintance with the appellant's workplace or disciplinary history. The impact of a constitutional due process objection based on a penalty set in part based on factors known to the deciding official but not noticed in the proposal is illustrated by <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 116 MSPR 470, 472-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 2011 MSPB 63 (2011), reversing the action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant worked as an Information Technology Specialist, GS-11, for the agency. On October 1, 2009, the agency proposed to remove the appellant based on the charges of misuse of her government telephone, misuse of her government laptop computer, and misuse of her government desktop computer. The charges included twelve specifications alleging, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant spent 18.7 hours talking about non-government business on her government telephone over a 14-week period, that she accessed hundreds of web sites from her government desktop computer and laptop computer that were not related to her assigned duties between March 2009 and July 2009, that she utilized her administrative privileges to access numerous documents not related to her assigned duties on her government desktop computer, and that she sent and received at least 16 e-mails on her government desktop computer between March 2008 and July 2009 that were not related to her assigned duties. On November 5, 2009, following consideration of the appellant's oral and written replies, the deciding official sustained the appellant's removal, effective November 20, 2009, and the appellant filed a timely appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding the hearing requested by the appellant, the administrative judge affirmed the appellant's removal, sustaining eight of the twelve specifications. The administrative judge found that the agency established a nexus between the sustained misconduct and the efficiency of the service and that the penalty of removal was reasonable. He noted that the deciding official, who was also the appellant's second-line supervisor, set out the factors that he considered in determining the appropriate penalty in the decision letter and in his testimony, including the appellant's reply to the proposed removal and the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. The administrative judge found that the deciding official appropriately considered the appellant's prior 3-day suspension in February 2000 for misuse of a government credit card. The administrative judge also found that the deciding official appropriately considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, that the sustained misconduct was serious, and that the penalty of removal was within the tolerable bounds of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency intends to rely on aggravating factors, such as prior discipline, as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors should be included in the advance notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors before the agency's deciding official. <span class="Italic">Vena v. Department of Labor</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 9 (2009); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 304 (1981). Similarly, it is improper for a deciding official to rely on an employee's alleged negative past work record in determining the penalty when the employee was not disciplined for the purported misconduct and where the incidents are mentioned as an aggravating factor for the first time in a Board proceeding. <span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 19 Fed. Appx. 868 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2330"></span>Our reviewing court has recently held that, if an employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty[,] " an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a constitutional due process violation. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011). When such circumstances are present, the court directed the Board to analyze whether the additional aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty constituted new and material information under the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. The court in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> made clear that, if a constitutional violation has occurred, it cannot be considered a harmless error and the agency action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the court held that, when determining whether to apply the harmless error rule for procedural errors, or to find a due process violation with respect to such activity, the Board should "consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice. In deciding whether new and material information has been introduced by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts, the Board should...[consider] : whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. Ultimately, the inquiry of the Board is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 (instructing the Board to apply <span class="Italic">Stone</span> to any aggravating information to determine if "new and material information" was introduced); <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (applying the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> criteria). The court also stated in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> that "[w]hen deciding officials receive such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, employees are no longer on notice of the reasons for their dismissal and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency," and that "[p]rocedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence and the deciding official considers new and material information." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant does not assert that the deciding official should not have considered her alleged past instances of misconduct or her prior discipline on the basis that the agency failed to mention either in the notice of proposed removal or the decision letter. We find, however, that the administrative judge erred in failing to address the deciding official's improper consideration of the appellant's prior discipline and alleged past instances of misconduct in imposing the penalty of removal given that these factors were not included in the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reveals that, in his written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the deciding official listed the appellant's prior 3-day suspension in February 2000 for misuse of a government credit card. Additionally, the deciding official testified that he considered the appellant's 3-day suspension when evaluating the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, noting that "[t]here's a level of trust associated with a government credit card as there is an Admin account, so that was a consideration...." The deciding official also testified that the appellant's work record was "checkered in the sense that there were a number of instances of the [appellant] creating tension within the work area, some confrontational behavior, and misuse of the credit card previously noted." Similarly, in his written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the deciding official stated that, with respect to the appellant's past work record, he was "aware of episodes of erratic timeliness to work and patterns of leave abuse" as well as "instances of confrontational behavior" and admonishment "for soliciting money from junior employees while at work to repay personal indebtedness." The agency did not include the appellant's prior 3-day suspension or her alleged past instances of misconduct as factors on which it relied in proposing her removal or in its decision letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first note that the instant case does not involve the same type of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications at issue in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> and <span class="Italic">Ward</span> because there is no evidence that the deciding official learned of the appellant's prior 3-day suspension or alleged past instances of misconduct from the proposing official, another agency employee, or any outside source. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1278 (considering the deciding official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with three supervisors and one manager from the agency during which he learned of several alleged past instances of misconduct by Mr. Ward); <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1372-73 (considering <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> memoranda received by the deciding official from the proposing official and another agency official urging Mr. Stone's removal). Rather, the record here indicates that the deciding official, most likely as a result of his role as the appellant's second-level supervisor, was personally aware of the appellant's 3-day suspension as well as the alleged past instances of misconduct. Nevertheless, we discern, and the Federal Circuit has suggested, no basis on which to distinguish <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introducing new and material information not included in the notice of proposed removal that was previously unknown by the deciding official from material information related to an employee's past disciplinary record and alleged past instances of misconduct personally known and considered by the deciding official. When a deciding official considers either type of information, the employee is no longer on notice of portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency in imposing the penalty, resulting in a potential constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 9 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the information related to the appellant's prior 3-day suspension and other alleged past instances of misconduct considered by the deciding official in his penalty analysis constitutes new, rather than cumulative, information. While the appellant was clearly aware of her prior 3-day suspension and potentially even aware of the other alleged misconduct cited by the deciding official, the agency did not include this information in its notice of proposed removal or elsewhere in the case file provided to the appellant, and thus it cannot be considered cumulative. Further, because the agency failed to advise the appellant that it considered such information in proposing or deciding to remove her, the appellant did not have an opportunity to respond to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, while it is undisputed based on his testimony and written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors that the deciding official considered the prior 3-day suspension and alleged past instances of misconduct, there is no evidence that the information resulted in undue pressure on the deciding official to remove the appellant. Addressing this factor, however, the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> emphasized that whether the additional information was of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official is only one of the several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry in the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. The court recognized that "the lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where...the [d]eciding [o]fficial admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination," making the "materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications...self-evident from the [d]eciding [o]fficial's admission." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, while no clear evidence of undue pressure exists in the record, the deciding official's consistent statements in his testimony and written statement on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are clear evidence of the materiality of the appellant's past disciplinary record and alleged past instances of misconduct in the deciding official's decision to remove the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the information regarding the appellant's 3-day suspension and other alleged past instances of misconduct constitutes new and material information in light of the fact that the agency failed to advise the appellant that it would consider such information in determining the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">see also Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. We further find that the deciding official's consideration of such aggravating factors without the appellant's knowledge was "so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Consequently, because the agency violated the appellant's due process guarantee to notice, the agency's error cannot be excused as harmless, and the appellant's removal must be cancelled. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. The agency may not remove the appellant unless and until she is afforded a new "constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">see also Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record here indicates that the deciding official, most likely as a result of her role as the appellant's third-level supervisor, was personally aware of the appellant's prior security incident.
