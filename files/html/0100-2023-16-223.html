<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-223"><span class="space">6.</span> Partnerships, Quality Circles</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Clinton Administration's National Performance Review and partnership principles defined by Executive Order 12871 (Exec. Order 12871 was revoked on February 17, 2001, by Executive Order 13202 [66 Fed. Reg. 11227]) led to the formation of partnership councils or similarly motivated groups consisting of representatives of management, employees, and unions. Those groups considered how the agency could be restructured to improve its service to the public. A component of the restructuring was enhancement of workplace operations and relation. Those participating in partnership groups discussed and made recommendations or decisions as to matters affecting terms and conditions of employees' work. Partnerships also provided a vehicle for collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-143 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 55 FLRA 317, 318 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, Standiford ATCT and NATCA Local SDF</span>, 53 FLRA 312, 319 (1997)). These partnerships are no more. Exec. Order 12871 was revoked on February 17, 2001, by Executive Order 13203 [66 Fed. Reg. 11227]. Section 3 of Exec. Order 13203 provides that agency heads shall move to rescind order, rules, or policies enforcing Exec. Order 12871. Section 4 of Exec. Order 13203 provides that "[n]othing in this order shall abrogate any collective bargaining agreements in effect on the date of this order."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Council of HUD Local 222 and DHUD</span>, 54 FLRA 1267, 1268-87 (1998), provided FLRA's most extensive commentary on the impact of multi-union partnerships on agency bargaining obligations. The case arose in the context of a reorganization or "reinvention" of the agency. The arbitrator was required to determine whether the agency committed a ULP by involving a union representing a national unit, as well as a different union representing some field office employees, in a task force to discuss issues related to the reorganization. At partnership meetings, matters were discussed that could have been negotiated. Because of the careful structuring of the partnership and reservation by the national union of bargaining authority for matters that the union wanted to exclude from the partnership process, FLRA affirmed the arbitrator's conclusion that no ULP was committed through the operation of the partnership. FLRA determined that consensus decision-making is one manner for conducting bargaining. When an agency's contacts with a union other than the exclusive representative do not exclude the exclusive representative, and preserve the exclusive representative's role in the determination of conditions of employment, the agency is not engaged in direct dealing in violation of the Statute. Over the dissent of Member Wasserman, who would have required the agency to participate in traditional multi-union bargaining, FLRA determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE is the exclusive representative of a nationwide unit of Agency employees.&#x2003;AFGE also has national consultation rights with the Agency under section 7113 of the Statute. AFGE entered into a partnership agreement with the Agency in November 1993.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NFFE is the exclusive representative of units of Agency employees in three regions of the Agency.&#x2003;NFFE and the Agency entered into a partnership agreement in April 1994.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to these agreements, in early 1993, the Agency had implemented a reinvention process for the Agency. This process involved solicitation of the views of employees on ways to improve the performance of the Agency. Both AFGE and NFFE participated in this process. In August 1993, as a direct result of this reinvention process, the Agency announced a reorganization of its field operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In early November, 1993, AFGE objected to NFFE's involvement in national level activities such as the reinvention process. When NFFE representatives participated in planning for the Agency's December 1, 1993, program announcing the proposed reorganization to all Agency employees, and in the program itself, AFGE filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging a violation of its rights as an exclusive representative under section 7116(a)(1), (3), (5), and (8) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8-9. According to the Agency, NFFE's participation in these activities was based on the Agency head's policy to include both unions in the Agency's reinvention and reorganization efforts.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Regional Director refused to issue a complaint based on AFGE's charge. The Regional Director's decision was upheld by the General Counsel on appeal....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a part of the December 1 program, the Agency announced that, in order to plan the reorganization, it was establishing three levels of task forces or committees. Specifically, the first level, program area task forces, which were to be established by each Assistant Secretary whose program contained field operations. Pursuant to the Agency head's policy to include both AFGE and NFFE representatives on the task forces, the program area task forces, as established by the Agency, included one NFFE representative. The NFFE representative was added because the reorganization plans developed by the task forces would affect employees in the units represented by NFFE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 13, 1994, AFGE and the Agency executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) governing AFGE's participation in the reorganization planning process. NFFE and the Agency did not enter into any agreement governing NFFE's participation in the planning process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the MOU: (1) AFGE would have two representatives on the task forces; (2) AFGE and Agency representatives would be equal partners on those task forces; (3) the task forces would operate by consensus; (4) issues not resolved by consensus would be reserved for bargaining; (5) AFGE would be provided the same information as other members of the task forces; (6) the AFGE Executive Board would have the opportunity to approve program task force consensus decisions prior to their submission to the Assistant Secretaries; and (7) if changes were requested by the Assistant Secretaries, the AFGE Executive Board would have the opportunity to approve those changes prior to their final submission to the overview committee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also established the second level, field reorganization task force (FRTF), to consider issues and recommendations from the program area task forces. As established, the FRTF included both AFGE and NFFE representatives. At some point, which is unclear from the record, the third level, a Deputy Secretary overview committee, was established.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, AFGE alleged that inclusion of NFFE representatives on the task forces violated section 7116(a)(1), (3), (5), and (8) of the Statute and Articles 1 and 5 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. AFGE claimed that NFFE participation on the task forces was in derogation of its national exclusive representation rights. In response, the Agency argued that NFFE representatives participated on the task forces only to represent the interests of employees in the units it represents. According to the Agency, the fact that NFFE did not have national level recognition was "inconsequential." The Arbitrator framed the issue as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Whether the Agency's action in permitting representatives of [NFFE] to participate on the Agency's national level reorganization task forces violated the Federal Labor[-]Management Relations Statute, Sections 7116(a)(1), (3), (5), and (8), and Articles 1 and 5, of the Parties' Agreement, and, if so, what is the appropriate remedy?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Arbitrator rejected the Agency's claim that NFFE has national consultation rights under section 7113 of the Statute. According to the Arbitrator, under section 2426.1(a)(1) and (b)(1) of the Authority's Regulations, a request for national consultation rights is a condition precedent to the grant of such rights. The Arbitrator found that there was "no probative evidence that NFFE ever requested such national consultation rights." Further, he found that there was "no evidence that any such rights were granted or established at any relevant time."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1484"></span>The Arbitrator also concluded that AFGE "failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the Agency's actions with respect to the inclusion of NFFE representatives on the reorganization task forces violated [AFGE's] recognitional or exclusive national level bargaining rights under the Agreement or under the Statute." Specifically, the Arbitrator found that there was "no assertion or evidence that the Agency has taken any actions which directly constitute a refusal to bargain with [AFGE] at the national level or at the appropriate local levels about any matter concerning the reinvention/reorganization efforts of the [Agency]." The Arbitrator also found that there was no "evidence that the Agency, in fact, has bargained directly with NFFE concerning any matter which appropriately should be negotiated with [AFGE] either at the national level only or at the local level for Regional Field Offices represented by AFGE."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that, under the MOU, AFGE and the Agency had agreed that "the process...by which the various task forces are to conduct their affairs was intended to be by <span class="Italic">consensus</span> through discussion, rather than by formal <span class="Italic">bargaining</span>." In this connection, he found that the task forces, which included representatives of AFGE, NFFE, and the Agency, had in fact operated by consensus. Consensus was achieved when all parties reached agreement on an issue. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that "[t]here is no dispute that, in fact, the [p]arties, including representatives of AFGE and of NFFE, as well as management officials, have proceeded in their respective task force deliberations on the basis of attempting to achieve 'consensus' by discussing problems and issues until general agreement is reached." He also found that, under the MOU, AFGE's "Executive Board has the right to disapprove of any 'consensus agreement' by any of the task forces and that [AFGE] has the right to require formal bargaining concerning any matter otherwise appropriate for such negotiations." In this regard, under the MOU, if AFGE did not agree to any matter about which NFFE and the Agency had reached agreement, AFGE was free to preserve that matter for bargaining. The Arbitrator concluded that NFFE's participation on the task forces did not preclude AFGE from bargaining with the Agency on any matter considered by those task forces.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that there was no evidence that the Agency "dealt inappropriately with the NFFE representatives on any of the task forces on any subject related to the reorganization of the Agency." The Arbitrator considered an inappropriate subject to be one that "does not impact employees in NFFE-represented [f]ield [o]ffices[.]" The Arbitrator found that AFGE had presented no evidence that the Agency discussed with NFFE representatives subjects that affected only employees in AFGE-represented field offices and not in NFFE-represented field offices. The Arbitrator concluded that AFGE's argument amounted to a claim that the Agency should have discussed the issues addressed by the task forces with AFGE and NFFE separately, a process that would have been "duplicative" and "inefficient."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator rejected AFGE's claim that the presence of NFFE representatives on the task forces allowed NFFE to "'veto'" any consensus that might otherwise have been reached by AFGE and the Agency. The Arbitrator found that there was no evidence that NFFE had, in fact, vetoed a consensus reached by AFGE and the Agency on any issue. The Arbitrator also found that AFGE "and the Agency, without interference by NFFE, could negotiate formally a resolution of such [an] issue in national bargaining which was entirely consistent with their proposed consensus at the task force level which had been 'vetoed' by NFFE."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Arbitrator rejected AFGE's claim that, by allowing a NFFE representative to attend the meeting at the Richmond Field Office, the Agency "unfairly demonstrated favoritism toward NFFE over the AFGE in a manner which interfered with AFGE's recognitional or representational rights." The Arbitrator noted that: (1) there was only one bargaining unit employee, the AFGE local president, present when the NFFE representative was asked to explain the nature and purposes of NFFE; (2) the AFGE local president was not part of a "captive audience"; and (3) the AFGE local president was not refused an opportunity to respond to anything she felt was objectionable in the NFFE representative's statement. Consequently, the Arbitrator concluded that there was no evidence that the Agency's actions at the meeting constituted: (1) "favoritism" toward NFFE; (2) an "improper attempt" to "demean AFGE in front of bargaining unit employees"; or (3) "an attempt to deprive AFGE of its legitimate representational and recognitional interests."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitrator denied AFGE's grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award Is Not Contrary to Section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed in more detail below, the facts as found by the Arbitrator demonstrate that the Agency established task forces and that both AFGE and NFFE accepted the Agency's invitation to participate in the task forces. These facts also demonstrate that NFFE's participation in the task forces had absolutely no effect on AFGE's right to bargain on behalf of, or otherwise represent, employees in the bargaining unit for which it is entitled to act exclusively. Further, nothing in the Arbitrator's findings provides a basis on which to speculate that AFGE's rights would have been affected if it had chosen, instead, not to participate on the task forces.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we are compelled to conclude that the Arbitrator's award is not deficient as inconsistent with section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. In so doing, we do not establish a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. We also do not expand the situations in which agencies are permitted to deal directly with individuals or institutions other than the exclusive representative. We are simply doing what is required under section 7122 of the Statute: applying the law as we understand it to the facts found by the Arbitrator to resolve the exceptions now before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Principles Applied In Determining Direct Dealings In Violation of Section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority Precedent</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute, once a union is certified as the exclusive representative of an appropriate unit of agency employees, the agency must "deal only with" that representative concerning any matter affecting the conditions of employment of employees in that unit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 32 and U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 499-500 (1995) (<span class="Italic">OPM</span>), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 32 v. FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1997). An agency fails to comply with this obligation when it deals directly with someone other than the exclusive representative concerning matters that are within the scope of the exclusive representative's authority as to unit employees' conditions of employment. Specifically, an agency fails to comply with its obligation to deal only with an exclusive representative by dealing directly either with another union [11] or with unit employees [12] on matters that are within the sole authority of that exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;An agency is not required under the Statute to bargain with one exclusive representative about conditions of employment in a unit represented by another union because such a requirement would run afoul of the principle of exclusive recognition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, North Carolina v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1442 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>) ("We are not aware of any case--in either the public or private sectors--in which an employer has been required to bargain with a union over the conditions of employment of <span class="Italic">employees in another bargaining unit....</span><span class="Italic">&#8197;</span>There is a good reason why no such case appears to exist--for a court to so hold would violate the fundamental principle that a union is the exclusive representative of employees in the certified or recognized unit, and those employees <span class="Italic">only</span>." (emphasis in original)). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 51 FLRA at 505, 507-08 (discussion of application of <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> to proposals that determine the conditions of employment of employees in units represented by another union).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;By dealing directly with employees in a unit of exclusive recognition concerning their conditions of employment, an agency deprives the union of its rights as an exclusive representative in violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Bastrop, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1339, 1346 (1996) (<span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves an allegation that the Agency violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by dealing directly with NFFE over matters that are within the scope of the AFGE's authority as an exclusive representative. The Authority has not previously considered a case where it is alleged that an agency bypassed the exclusive representative in violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (5) by directly dealing with a union other than the exclusive representative. The Authority has, however, considered cases in which an agency is alleged to have violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) by dealing directly with unit employees. Although we recognize, as does our dissenting colleague, that the two situations are factually distinct, we agree with AFGE that it is useful to examine this precedent. In this regard, although such cases involve dealings with unit employees, not other unions, in both situations the core issue is the same: whether the agency has met its obligation to the exclusive representative. As there is no claim that the cases on which we rely for the principles applied here were wrongly decided, Authority precedent concerning an agency's dealings with unit employees is relevant for identifying the principles to be applied in resolving whether an agency's dealings with a union other than the exclusive representative direct dealings in violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, an agency violates section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute when it deals directly with employees in a unit of exclusive recognition concerning their conditions of employment such that the agency's conduct interferes with the exclusive representative's rights under section 7114(a) to act for and represent all employees in the bargaining unit....&#8197;Such conduct "inherently undermines the status of the [exclusive representative] and constitutes a violation of the Statute." <span class="Italic"><span id="page_1485"></span>Air Force Accounting and Finance Center, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colorado</span>, 42 FLRA 1226, 1239 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Lowry Air Force Base</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority has not defined the phrase "direct dealings," it has identified specific activities that violate the Statute. For example, an agency deals directly with employees in violation of the Statute when it communicates with an employee concerning that employee's grievance. <span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop</span>, 51 FLRA at 1346-47. An agency also deals directly with unit employees in violation of the Statute when, without contacting the exclusive representative, it solicits employee assistance in establishing a condition of employment and adopts an alternative suggested by employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowry Air Force Base</span>, 42 FLRA at 1239 (management approval and implementation of employee proposal concerning work schedule constitutes direct dealing which undermined the status of the union); <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Los Angeles, California</span>, 15 FLRA 100, 104 (1984) (agency solicited employee suggestions of alternatives for development of new watch schedule and adopted one of the alternatives despite union objections). Where an agency threatens and promises benefits to employees, indirectly urging employees to put pressure on the exclusive representative to change its position, the agency deals directly with employees in violation of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Iowa National Guard and National Guard Bureau</span>, 8 FLRA 500, 513 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, not all contacts between an agency and employees constitute direct dealings that violate the Statute. Where an agency's contacts with employees on matters affecting conditions of employment do not exclude the exclusive representative, and the agency recognizes its obligation to bargain only with the exclusive representative, the agency is not involved in direct dealing in violation of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service (District, Region, National Office Units)</span>, 19 FLRA 353 (1985) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), <span class="Italic">affirmed</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 826 F.2d 114 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (no direct dealing in violation of the Statute where agency notified union of employee questionnaire, provided union with copies, agreed to provide union with information derived from questionnaires, and acknowledged obligation to bargain with the union over any changes it made based on information in questionnaires). In addition, the Authority has found that an agency's dealings with employees in a situation where the union has no statutory rights do not constitute direct dealing in violation of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Government Printing Office</span>, 23 FLRA 35, 40 (1986) (agency did not violate Statute by dealing directly with employee concerning her EEO complaint because "the exclusive representative had no <span class="Italic">statutory</span> rights or obligation to represent her in that process").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, not all contacts between an agency and unit employees constitute direct dealings that violate the Statute. As applied in this decision, however, the phrase "direct dealings" is used to refer to agency conduct that undermines the exclusive representative and thereby violates the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Precedent Under the National Labor Relations Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that, as is the case here, "[w]hen there are comparable provisions under the Statute and the NLRA, decisions of the NLRB and the courts interpreting the NLRA have a high degree of relevance to similar circumstances under the Statute." <span class="Italic">U.S. Geological Survey, Caribbean District Office, San Juan, Puerto Rico</span>, 53 FLRA 1006, 1015 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Caribbean District Office</span>), quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office</span>, 37 FLRA 1371, 1381 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The comparable provision under the National Labor Relations Act (Act) to section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute is section 8(a)(1) and (5). The type of activities identified by the Authority as constituting direct dealing with employees in violation of section 7116(a))(1) and (5) are also held by the National Labor Relations Board (Board) to constitute direct dealing with employees that violates section 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Central Management Co.</span>, 314 NLRB 763, 767 (1994); <span class="Italic">Allied-Signal, Inc.</span>, 307 NLRB 752, 753-54 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Allied-Signal</span>); <span class="Italic">Facet Enterprises, Inc.</span>, 290 NLRB 152, 153 (1988). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 321 U.S. 678, 683-86 (1944). "Direct dealing need not take the form of actual bargaining." <span class="Italic">Allied Signal</span>, 307 NLRB at 753. According to the Board, the test for determining direct dealing between an employer and unit employees in violation of the Act involves an inquiry into whether the employer's dealings are "likely to erode 'the [u]nion's position as exclusive representative.'" <span class="Italic">Allied-Signal</span>, 307 NLRB at 753, citing <span class="Italic">Modern Merchandising</span>, 284 NLRB 1377, 1379 (1987). Where an employer deals with employees concerning matters that are not within the union's exclusive authority, however, it does not commit an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">E. I. Du Pont &#x0026; Co.</span>, 311 NLRB 893, 897 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Summary of Principles</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account both Authority and Board precedent, we summarize as follows the principles we will apply for determining whether an agency's conduct constitutes direct dealing with a union other than the exclusive representative that is in violation of the Statute. In determining whether an agency's contacts with a union other than the exclusive representative amount to such direct dealing, we will examine whether the agency's actions undermine the rights of the exclusive representative. Where an agency's contacts with a union other than the exclusive representative do not exclude the exclusive representative, and preserve the exclusive representative's role in the determination of conditions of employment, the agency is not engaged in direct dealing in violation of the Statute. In addition, where an agency's contacts with a union other than the exclusive representative do not involve matters within the scope of the statutory authority of the exclusive representative, the agency also is not engaged in direct dealing contrary to the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn, then, to the application of these principles to the Arbitrator's findings with respect to the Agency's dealings with NFFE in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Principles</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency's decision to include NFFE in the Agency-wide reorganization task forces did not deprive AFGE of any of its rights as an exclusive representative under the Statute. According to the Arbitrator, AFGE reserved the right to bargain, consistent with law, over those matters about which the task forces did not reach consensus. The Arbitrator found that the inclusion of NFFE on the task forces did not interfere with AFGE's authority as an exclusive representative to determine the conditions of employment for its unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Arbitrator's factual findings regarding the inclusion of AFGE and NFFE on the task forces, to which we defer, we find that AFGE retained the right to bargain with the Agency over any matters with respect to which the task forces did not reach consensus. Applying the principles outlined above, we further find that the presence of NFFE on those task forces did not undermine AFGE's statutory rights as the exclusive representative of its unit. Any conditions of employment pertaining to the reorganization that would apply to the AFGE unit would apply only because AFGE was part of the consensus reached in the reorganization task forces or because it had separately bargained them with the Agency after consensus within the task force was not reached. In this respect, we do not view the Arbitrator as having drawn a bright line between consensus decision-making and bargaining. His decision is not based on that distinction, but on his findings as to the nature and scope of the matters discussed in the task forces. However, to the extent that the Arbitrator drew such a line, we, like the dissent, firmly reject this. Consensus decision-making is not distinct from bargaining; rather, it is one manner in which bargaining may be conducted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Standiford Air Traffic Control Tower, Louisville, Kentucky</span>, 53 FLRA 312, 319 (1997). In our view, however, it does not follow that a process that uses consensus becomes, <span class="Italic">ipso</span> <span class="Italic">facto</span>, collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE was a full participant in the task force process, and lost none of its rights as exclusive representative as a result of NFFE's participation in the process. If AFGE disagreed with the Agency's decision to invite NFFE, as well as AFGE, to participate in the task forces, it was free to withdraw from the task forces and bargain with the Agency over the implementation of the reorganization in the units that it represents, through bilateral negotiations conducted through whatever ground rules are agreed upon.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Regions</span>, 53 FLRA 1269 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FDA</span>), <span class="Italic">motion for stay denied</span>, April 29, 1998, relied on in the dissent. In that case, the agency violated the Statute by insisting that the union surrender its right to bargain for its unit of exclusive representation as a whole. Here, the Agency did not insist that AFGE do anything. AFGE's and NFFE's participation on the task forces in this case was a voluntary arrangement and, as such, we disagree with our colleague that NFFE's participation ran afoul of the principle of exclusivity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator properly found that AFGE has not met its burden of demonstrating that the Agency undermined AFGE's statutory rights as exclusive representative by dealing directly with NFFE on matters within the scope of AFGE's authority in violation of section 7116(a)(5) and (1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency's Action Does Not Constitute an Independent Violation of Section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE argues that the Agency's direct dealings with NFFE on the reorganization task forces demean AFGE and constitute an independent violation of section 7116(a)(1). Under Authority precedent, by dealing directly with unit employees, an agency "demeans" the union and "inherently interferes with the rights of employees to designate and rely on the union for representation," thereby independently violating section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop</span>, 51 FLRA at 1346, quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and Social Security Administration, Region X, Seattle, Washington</span>, 39 FLRA 298, 311 (1991) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Region X</span>). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">438th Air Base Group (MAC), McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey</span>, 28 FLRA 1112 (1987); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 16 FLRA 434 (1984). As described above, we have found no direct dealing between the Agency and NFFE in violation of the Statute in the circumstances of this case. AFGE does <span id="page_1486"></span>not argue any other basis for finding an independent violation of section 7116(a)(1). Consequently, applying the test set forth in <span class="Italic">FCI, Bathrop</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA, Region X</span>, we conclude that the Agency's dealings with NFFE on the reorganization task forces do not constitute an independent violation of section 7116(a)(1). Consequently, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency's Action Did Not Create Multi-Unit Bargaining Without AFGE's Consent and Did Not Violate Section 7116(a)(5) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject AFGE's claim, based on <span class="Italic">INS</span>, that the Arbitrator's award improperly allows the Agency to create multi-unit bargaining without AFGE's consent. In properly finding that the Agency had not violated section 7116(a)(5), the Arbitrator found that, pursuant to the MOU, AFGE had retained its rights under the Statute. The AFGE Executive Board could veto any consensus agreement reached by any of the task forces. Moreover, AFGE retained the right to bargain over any matters about which the task forces did not reach consensus. Consequently, AFGE was not bound by any matters with respect to which the Agency and NFFE, but not AFGE, reached agreement. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 16 FLRA at 85-87 (absent timely withdrawal, party to multi-unit bargaining is bound by results of that bargaining). AFGE's argument that the award bound it to the results of the task forces contrary to its rights under the Statute fails to demonstrate that the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award Is Not Contrary to Section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 52 FLRA 1159 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Social Security</span>), <span class="Italic">affirmed in relevant part and reversed in part</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, Case No. 97-1204 (D.C. Cir. March 27, 1998), the Authority established the framework it will follow in analyzing whether agency actions constitute a violation of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. Under that framework, the "central question" is "whether the agency action...sponsored, controlled, or assisted" a union. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1174. In answering that question, the Authority examines "whether, in the totality of circumstances, the employer interfered with employee freedom of choice by failing to maintain a proper arms-length relationship with the labor organization involved." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1176. Equivalent status is only a "factor to be considered" in the analysis under section 7116(a)(3). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1174-75 n.12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE claims that because NFFE does not have equivalent status with AFGE, the Agency's actions with respect to NFFE constituted a violation of section 7116(a)(3). Under the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Social Security</span>, however, equivalent status is only one factor among many that the Authority will consider. It is not a dispositive factor. The lack of equivalent status for NFFE is thus not sufficient to establish a violation of section 7116(a)(3). As the Arbitrator found, the Agency's inclusion of NFFE in the reorganization task forces did not deprive AFGE of its rights as an exclusive representative. The Agency's actions implementing NFFE's participation in the task forces therefore did not deprive AFGE unit employees of full representation by the labor organization of their choice. <span class="Italic">Social Security</span>, 52 FLRA at 1175-78. Consequently, AFGE provided no basis for concluding that the Agency impermissibly sponsored NFFE within the meaning of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute....</p>
