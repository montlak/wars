<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-19"><span class="space">b.</span> Recent Application of the Doctrine</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior and NFFE Local 1309</span>, 56 FLRA at 45-47, 50-54 (2000), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> expressed FLRA's commitment to, or its unwillingness to depart from, the "covered by" doctrine after the Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1309 v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1003 (1999), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. There remained the trenchant question of how the "covered by" test would be defined and applied.</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis applied by FLRA of whether a matter is "covered by" an existing agreement is expressed in<span class="Italic"> DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Office Locals, Council 220</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>), <span class="Italic">post</span>. First, FLRA looks to the express language of the provision of the agreement to determine if it reasonably encompasses the subject in dispute. Exact congruence of the language is not required. The necessary similarity exists if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the subject in dispute. If the provision does not expressly encompass the subject, the second prong will be applied. FLRA determines whether the subject in dispute is inseparably bound up with and plainly an aspect of a subject expressly covered by the contract. Restated, FLRA determines if the subject in dispute is so commonly considered to be an aspect of a subject set forth in a provision of a contract that negotiations over that subject are presumed foreclosed. If it is difficult to determine whether the subject matter sought to be bargained is an aspect of matters already negotiated, FLRA examines all of the record evidence, including the parties' bargaining history, and decides whether the parties reasonably should have contemplated that the agreement would foreclose further bargaining. Under <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 137 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 60 FLRA 483, 487 (2004) (<span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 61 FLRA 60 (2005)), the "covered by" doctrine applies only to negotiated agreements, not to policies or working conditions unilaterally, though lawfully, implemented by an agency. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-016.html#sec8-17">Midterm Bargaining Obligation and the 'Covered By' Doctrine: <span class="Italic">SSA</span></a><span class="Italic">," for more recent decisions from the courts.]</span><span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA summarized the "covered by" doctrine in a negotiability appeal involving proposed ground rules. The agency disclaimed negotiability because the subject matter of the proposal--travel costs for negotiators during components of the negotiations of those rules--was already encompassed ("covered by") the existing master agreement, and FLRA agreed with the agency, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216 and EEOC</span>, 71 FLRA 603, 606-07 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting in part) (Proposal 3):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Official Time and Scheduling of Union Team Members.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-3">e.&#x2003;Travel for negotiators will be in accordance with Article 7.05, Section (c) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA") during negotiations as well as anytime the Parties are participating in mediation sessions under the auspices of [the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS)] or sessions directed by [the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Meaning</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the parties agree that the proposal requires the Agency to pay travel costs under Section 7.05 of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement in connection with proceedings before the FMCS and FSIP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: Proposal 3 is covered by Article 7 of the parties' agreement.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because the proposal is "covered by" Article 7 of the parties' agreement, and is contrary to various government-wide regulations. Under &#x00A7; 2424.2 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will consider a petition for review of a negotiability dispute only when the parties disagree "concerning the legality of a proposal."[37] Where a proposal raises <span class="Italic">both</span> a bargaining-obligation dispute and a negotiability dispute, the Authority may resolve both disputes,[38] or the Authority may resolve only the bargaining-obligation dispute if doing so establishes that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain.[39] For the reasons below, resolving the Agency's covered-by objection fully disposes of Proposal 3, so we need not address the Agency's remaining arguments.[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Article 7, Section 7.05 concerns the procedures for local and national negotiations between the parties. Subsection (c) states that, "[i]f a negotiating session is requested and such a meeting is scheduled, the EMPLOYER shall pay the travel and per diem of one (1) UNION negotiator for national negotiations." Further, subsection (e) explains that "[i]f, after discussion of the proposals, agreement cannot be reached, either Party may inform the other Party in writing that it is initiating the statutory procedures provided in" &#x00A7; 7119 of the Statute and its implementing regulations--which govern the resolution of negotiation impasses before the FMCS and FSIP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the wording of Section 7.05 above, we find that the parties have bargained over when the Agency will pay for travel and per diem in connection with negotiations, and how the parties will bring their negotiation impasses to the FMCS or FSIP for assistance. Indeed, Proposal 3 references and incorporates Section 7.05 of the existing agreement, and the Union asserts that the proposal "exten[ds]" the reach of Section 7.05. Both of these features show that Proposal 3 concerns a matter that is expressly contained in the agreement. The Union argues that there is "no evidence [that] the parties ever contemplated travel and per diem...during FMCS and FSIP proceedings" when negotiating Section 7.05, but the D.C. Circuit has held that "whether the parties intended a particular <span id="Page_1239"></span>outcome does not resolve the 'covered-by' analysis."[50] Thus, the Union's argument fails to overcome the plain wording of Section 7.05(c) and (e) of the agreement, which indicates that Proposal 3's subject matter is covered by Article 7. Accordingly, Proposal 3 is outside the duty to bargain.</p>

<p class="noindent">That a union might have sought to bargain a matter during term contract negotiations does not block it from bargaining over arrangements tailored to meet management changes during the term if the contract does not address the topic or contain an integration or zipper clause, as <span class="Italic">AFGE, SSA Gen.

<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, the Agency's argument that the Union should have sought to bargain over the space-heater policy during term negotiations does not establish that the proposals are outside the duty to bargain. Under the Authority's covered-by doctrine, a party is not required to bargain over terms and conditions of employment that have already been resolved by bargaining.[105] But, for the covered-by doctrine to apply, the subject matter of the disputed proposals must be either "expressly contained in" the parties' collective-bargaining agreement, or "inseparably bound up with," and thus "plainly an aspect of" a subject expressly covered by the agreement.[106] Here, the Agency does not claim that the parties' agreement expressly addresses space heaters or that the agreement contains a "zipper" clause.[107] Rather, it claims simply that term negotiations would have been a more opportune time for the Union to raise the space-heater policy and that ordering the parties to bargain over the Union's proposals "would be inconsistent with the intent of Statute...to promote stability." However, this argument does not establish that the proposals are nonnegotiable.</p>

The Judge found that the Respondent did not violate the Statute as alleged and recommended that the complaint be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts, which are set forth more fully in the Judge's decision, are summarized below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) is the exclusive representative of a consolidated nationwide bargaining unit of the Respondent's employees. The parties negotiated a master labor agreement (MLA) in 1982, which was superseded by another MLA that became effective on January 25, 1990, by order of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (the Panel).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a letter to the Respondent's Commissioner dated April 11, 1988, AFGE delegated to its locals the right to initiate mid-term bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 12, 1989, after having unsuccessfully attempted to bargain at the local level, the president of AFGE Local 1346 submitted the following request to negotiate and proposals concerning performance awards to the Respondent's Commissioner:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This constitutes a Union initiated proposal(s) for Mid-term bargaining on remedies for performance awards disputes. The authority for this action is <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 810 F.2d 295. The Union proposal is as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Manager will notify the Union [p]resident immediately in writing when performance award money becomes available.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;This notification will include total dollar amount designated for performance awards in the office.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Twenty percent of the award money shall be set aside for unit employees whose appraisals are subsequently raised later because of grievance or EEO complaint remedies.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Please notify us who your chief negotiator will be.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">P.S. The AFGE General Committee has delegated full [a]uthority to local presidents for this new statutory bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With the December 12, 1989, letter, the local president submitted ground rule proposals. In a letter dated January 25, 1990, the Respondent refused to negotiate, contending that it was not appropriate to bargain regarding performance awards during the term of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Respondent did not violate the Statute when it failed to negotiate with the local president concerning performance awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Union's Right to Initiate Mid-term Bargaining</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's contention that the Authority should adopt the 4th Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA,</span> which held "that union-initiated midterm bargaining is not required by the [S]tatute and would undermine the [C]ongressional policies underlying the [S]tatute." 956 F.2d at 1281. We respectfully disagree with the 4th Circuit's decision, and we will continue to adhere to our holding in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> that the duty to bargain in good faith that is imposed by the Statute requires an agency to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union-initiated proposals concerning matters that are not contained in the collective bargaining agreement, unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved. <span class="Italic">See Headquarters, 127th Tactical Fighter Wing, Michigan Air National Guard, Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan,</span> 46 FLRA 582 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Selfridge National Guard Base</span>).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Respondent's Obligation to Bargain Over the Mid-Term Bargaining Proposals</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Proposals Were Covered by the 1982 MLA</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that, in general, the Respondent had an obligation to bargain with the duly authorized agent of AFGE over matters of local concern and that AFGE had not waived its right to engage in such mid-term negotiations, we now turn to the question of whether the matters over which the Union sought to bargain were contained in or covered by provisions of the 1982 MLA so as to preclude further bargaining during the term of that agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;Test to Be Applied</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> the Authority held that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the duty to bargain in good faith imposed by the Statute requires an agency to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters which are not contained in the agreement unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved. Such a waiver of bargaining rights may be established by (1) express agreement, or (2) bargaining history. Further, any such waiver must be clear and unmistakable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 FLRA at 166.&#x2003;With regard to clear and unmistakable waivers, the Authority held that "the determinative factor is whether the particular subject matter of the proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations is the same." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 167. The Authority gave no guidance in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> as to how to determine whether matters are contained in or covered by an agreement. Shortly thereafter, however, the Authority stated that it would apply the same test to analyze whether a matter is covered by an agreement as set forth in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> for determining a waiver by bargaining history. <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, Kansas City, Missouri,</span> 31 FLRA 1231, 1235-36 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Army Corps of Engineers</span>). Thus, the Authority held that in determining whether a matter is covered by an agreement, "the determinative factor is whether the particular subject matter of the proposals...is the same." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1235, quoting <span class="Italic">IRS</span> at 167.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Marine Corps </span>the court criticized the Authority for changing the duty to bargain test set forth in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> by "collapsing the 'contained in'/'covered by' inquiry into the 'waiver' inquiry" without an adequate explanation for the new approach. 962 F.2d at 55. The court held that there is a distinct separation between the waiver that must occur before a union can relinquish its right to bargain about a matter and the union's consequent exercise of that right through negotiation. Although the court concluded that the matters at issue in the consolidated cases before it were clearly covered by provisions in the parties' collective bargaining agreements, it chose not to "establish a definitive test for determining when an otherwise bargainable matter is 'covered by' a public sector collective bargaining agreement...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 62. Consistent with the court's decision, we will establish a definitive test for determining when a matter is contained in or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The framework we establish today is intended to apply only to cases in which an agency asserts that it has no obligation to bargain based on the terms of a negotiated agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, a bargaining relationship involves ongoing communication between the parties, unbroken by the existence of a collective bargaining agreement. It has long been acknowledged in the private sector that a contract does not create a static period in the relationship between the employer and the employees for the term of that agreement. <span class="Italic">See National Labor Relations Board v. Jacobs Mfg. Co.,</span> 196 F.2d 680, 684 (2d Cir. 1952) (<span class="Italic">Jacobs Mfg.</span>). As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Jacobs Mfg.,</span> the existence of a contract does not relieve an employer "of the duty to bargain as to subjects which were neither discussed nor embodied in any of the terms and conditions of the contract." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the Federal sector, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has examined the "broad and unqualified" language of section 7114 of the Statute in light of the private sector law and has determined that the "duty to bargain extends also to mid-term proposals initiated by either management or labor, provided the proposals do not conflict with the existing agreement." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 810 F.2d 295, 299 (D.C. Cir. 1987). <span class="Italic">But see SSA v. FLRA</span> (agencies have no statutory obligation to bargain over union-initiated mid-term proposals). The overriding concern of these cases is that although bargaining agreements are intended to promote stability in the bargaining relationship, employers and unions in both the private and Federal sectors should be relatively unrestricted in their ability to resolve their disputes through collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See Jacobs Mfg.,</span> 196 F.2d at 684; <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 810 F.2d at 300-01.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, we strongly agree with the court in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps </span>that "[i]mplicit in [the] statutory purpose is the need to provide the parties to such an agreement with stability and repose with respect to matters reduced to writing in the agreement." 962 F.2d at 59. We also agree that to require an exact congruence between a provision of a contract and a proposal offered by a union in order for an agency to have no duty to engage in mid-term bargaining on the matter, would, in many cases, effectively nullify the terms of the parties' existing agreement. Accordingly, to the extent that any of our decisions require such congruence, they will no longer be followed. <span class="Italic">See, for example,</span> <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Engineers</span> (contract provisions involving procedures to be used in rating employees, including postponement when supervisor had less than 120 days to observe employee's performance against current requirements, did not cover proposal involving procedures to be used in rating employees who had not performed duties for 120 days due to extensive amounts of official time).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1241"></span>In sum, in examining whether a matter is contained in or covered by an agreement, we must be sensitive both to the policies embodied in the Statute favoring the resolution of disputes through bargaining and to the disruption that can result from endless negotiations over the same general subject matter. Thus, the stability and repose that we seek must provide a respite from unwanted change to both parties: upon execution of an agreement, an agency should be free from a requirement to continue negotiations over terms and conditions of employment already resolved by the previous bargaining; similarly, a union should be secure in the knowledge that the agency may not rely on that agreement to unilaterally change terms and conditions that were in no manner the subject of bargaining. If we meet these goals, we will have supported "the delicate balance of power between management and labor...." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA,</span> 856 F.2d 293, 301 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With these principles in mind, we will set forth a framework for determining whether a contract provision covers a matter in dispute. Initially, we will determine whether the matter is expressly contained in the collective bargaining agreement. In this examination, we will not require an exact congruence of language, but will find the requisite similarity if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute. <span class="Italic">See, for example, National Labor Relations Board v. Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Inc.,</span> 372 F.2d 691 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the provision does not expressly encompass the matter, we will next determine whether the subject is "inseparably bound up with and...thus [is] plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract." <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; S Industries, Inc.,</span> 158 NLRB 454, 459 (1966), cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps,</span> 962 F.2d at 60. In this regard, we will determine whether the subject matter of the proposal is so commonly considered to be an aspect of the matter set forth in the provision that the negotiations are presumed to have foreclosed further bargaining over the matter, regardless of whether it is expressly articulated in the provision. If so, we will conclude that the subject matter is covered by the contract provision. For example, under this test, and on further reflection, we agree with the court in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps </span>that the issues raised by the unions in that case involving the reassignment of four employees and the implementation of new performance standards were inseparably bound up with provisions of the extant contracts dealing with procedures and appropriate arrangements for, respectively, the detailing of employees and the establishment of performance appraisal systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that in some cases it will be difficult to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is, in fact, an aspect of matters already negotiated. For example, if the parties have negotiated procedures and appropriate arrangements to be operative when management decides to detail employees, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps,</span> it may not be self-evident that the contract provisions were intended to apply if management institutes a wholly new detail program, or decides during the term of the contract to detail employees who previously had never been subject to being detailed. To determine whether such matters are covered by an agreement, we will examine whether, based on the circumstances of the case, the parties reasonably should have contemplated that the agreement would foreclose further bargaining in such instances. In this examination, we will, where possible or pertinent, examine all record evidence. See, for example, <span class="Italic">Triangle PWC, Inc.,</span> 231 NLRB 492 (1977) (based on evidence of prior agreement and bargaining history, the Board determined that the subject of pension benefit levels was covered by the agreement). If the subject matter in dispute is only tangentially related to the provisions of the agreement and, on examination, we conclude that it was not a subject that should have been contemplated as within the intended scope of the provision, we will not find that it is covered by that provision. In such circumstances, there will be an obligation to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;Application of the Test in This Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first two proposals submitted by the Union involve a requirement that the Agency notify the Union in writing about the availability of performance award money, including the total amount designated for such awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 17 of the parties' 1982 MLA is entitled "Incentive Awards" and discusses in some detail the Respondent's incentive awards program. Section 1 of that provision establishes that the program is intended in part to "provide incentive awards to employees whose performance is substantially in excess of normal expectation...." Section 4, entitled "Awards Information," provides that the Union will be provided copies "of an annual report of incentive awards program." That provision further states that "[t]his report will show distribution of cash awards and high quality increases by grade and organization[al unit]." Thus, the parties have bargained over not only the general subject of performance awards, but also more specific matters regarding the disclosure of information relative to such awards. Applying the test discussed above, we conclude that the Union's mid-term proposals were unquestionably covered by the 1982 MLA for the reasons set forth more fully below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we conclude that the provision of information about the availability of performance award money is an issue that is inseparably bound up with matters negotiated regarding the incentive awards program in the 1982 MLA. The parties expressly addressed issues regarding procedures for reporting awards information to the Union. Although the 1982 MLA does not provide for the provision of information about the awards program before the distribution of awards, that issue is sufficiently similar in focus that it is, in our view, inseparably bound up with the information provisions set forth in Section 4. Accordingly, the Respondent fulfilled its bargaining obligation with regard to such matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that the third proposal, which would require that a certain amount of the award money be set aside for employees whose appraisals are subsequently raised because they prevailed in a grievance or EEO complaint, is covered by the 1982 MLA. Article 17, Section 1 of the 1982 MLA reflects the agreement of the parties that "an effective incentive awards program should result in a more effective work force, higher productivity, and improved working environment." It describes the operation of the awards program "within the context of budgetary considerations and limitations[.]" Section 2A.4 of that provision states that the Respondent "will make reasonable efforts to allot awards in proportion to the number of bargaining unit employees within each component." It is reasonable to assume that the parties recognized that, in light of the budgetary limitations recognized by the provision, the effectiveness of the program could be diminished by the failure to retain sufficient funds to provide remedies ordered as a result of third-party proceedings. Accordingly, the Union should have contemplated that the negotiated provisions would foreclose further bargaining in such situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondent was not obligated to bargain with the local president over any of the proposals submitted and did not violate the Statute by refusing to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "covered by" analysis was summarized in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE Local 3824</span>, 56 FLRA 9, 12-13 (2000), involving whether a negotiated provision preserved the right to bargain over aspects of the reorganization's implementation. The union filed a ULP when the employer declined to bargain over the procedures involved in reassignment of some employees. The issue was whether the reassignment issues were "covered by" the contract provisions concerning implementation of the reorganization. The unions' proposals were not blocked:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching his conclusion that the Respondent was obligated to bargain over the two reassignments, the Judge conducted two analyses. First, he determined that the Respondent did not have a valid "covered by" defense under <span class="Italic">SSA I</span> [47 FLRA 1004 (1993)]. Second, he engaged in contract interpretation under the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> [47 FLRA 1091 (1993), and found that the Union had expressly preserved, in the Bargaining Provisions, its right to bargain over the reassignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">SSA I </span>"covered by" defense is available to a party claiming that it is not obligated to bargain because it has already bargained over the subject at issue. The <span class="Italic">IRS</span> doctrine applies when a party "relies on a contract provision specifically concerning bargaining (such as a reopener or zipper clause)" that relates to the parties' bargaining obligations. <span class="Italic">SSA III, </span>55 FLRA at 538. The Authority has held that, in appropriate circumstances, both an <span class="Italic">SSA I </span>analysis and an <span class="Italic">IRS</span> analysis may apply in the same case<span class="Italic">. SSA III</span>, 55 FLRA at 537.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Bargaining Provisions, which are relied on by the General Counsel, describe the parameters of negotiations over the reorganization, they are provisions "concerning bargaining," as described in <span class="Italic">SSA III</span>. 55 FLRA at 538. Accordingly, consistent with the Authority's holdings in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> and <span class="Italic">III</span>, we reject the Respondent's argument that the Judge should not have considered the Bargaining Provisions in determining whether the two disputed reassignments were "covered by" Provision Ic. We find that it was appropriate, in these circumstances, for the Judge to engage in contract interpretation under <span class="Italic">IRS </span>in considering the Bargaining Provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As plainly worded, the Bargaining Provisions constitute a reservation of the Union's bargaining rights. The Judge found, on the basis of unrebutted testimony, that the Union intended those provisions to preserve its right to negotiate over placement of employees as the Respondent made staffing decisions throughout implementation of its reorganization, and that, during negotiations, the Union informed the Respondent of those intentions. The Judge also found that the parties' practice subsequent to agreeing to Provision lc was to negotiate over employee reassignments, and that this practice supported the conclusion that Provision lc did not foreclose further bargaining over reassignments. The Judge's findings regarding the parties' bargaining history and practices are supported by a preponderance of the relevant evidence in the record. Consistent with those findings, and with the plain wording of the Bargaining Provisions, we find that, by entering into the Bargaining Provisions, the parties agreed to engage in bargaining over all "things not foreseen," procedures," and "changes."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1242"></span>The Respondent argues that, even in light of the Bargaining Provisions, the parties' agreement to Provision 1c satisfied its bargaining obligation over the two disputed reassignments, and the Bargaining Provisions should not be interpreted to "negate" Provision Ic. However, the Judge found that Provision Ic was intended to deal with only one aspect of employee reassignments--the order in which such assignments would be issued--and that a myriad of other reassignment-related issues remained unresolved. As such, finding that Provision lc does not foreclose bargaining over these other issues does not "negate" Provision 1c. The Judge also found that there was no evidence in the parties' bargaining history or practices indicating that Provision lc was intended to satisfy the broad bargaining obligations set forth in the Bargaining Provisions. A preponderance of the evidence supports the Judge's findings, which, in turn, support his conclusion that Provision Ic does not provide the Respondent with a defense to its failure to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, based on the wording of the Bargaining Provisions and Provision 1c, the parties' bargaining history, and the parties' practices pursuant to their agreement, we agree with the Judge that the two disputed reassignments were not "covered by" Provision 1c of the parties' agreement. As a result, the Respondent's failure to bargain constitutes a violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute, and we deny the Respondent's exceptions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA III, </span>55 FLRA at 540.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Williamsburg and AFGE Local 525</span>, 68 FLRA 580, 582 (2015) (dissent by Member Pizzella) (master contract permitted local bargaining over compressed work schedules: "The 'covered-by' doctrine provides that the Statute does not require a party to bargain over matters that already have been resolved by bargaining. An argument that a matter is 'covered by' an agreement is an affirmative defense that a respondent has the burden of proving. The Authority has declined to find a matter 'covered by' an agreement where the agreement specifically contemplates bargaining. In order to determine whether a judge correctly found that an agreement specifically contemplates bargaining, the Authority determines whether the judge's interpretation is supported by the record and by the standards and principles applied by arbitrators and the federal courts."); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Oxford and AFGE Local 3495</span>, 68 FLRA 593 (2015) (dissent by Member Pizzella) (same as <span class="Italic">FCI Williamsburg</span>); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Littleton and AFGE Local 709</span>, 68 FLRA 605 (2015) (dissent by Member Pizzella) (same as <span class="Italic">FCI Williamsburg</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 61 FLRA 437, 441-42 (2006), a negotiability case, also summarizes application of the "covered by" doctrine:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether a matter is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement, the Authority applies a two-pronged test. Under the first prong, the Authority assesses whether the subject matter is "expressly contained in" the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018. "[E]xact congruence of language" is not required. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Instead, "if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute[,]" then the subject matter is covered by the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the subject matter is not expressly contained in the agreement, then the Authority applies the second prong of the analysis. Under the second prong, the Authority determines whether the matter is "inseparably bound up with and...thus [is] plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> That analysis considers the parties' intent and bargaining history. <span class="Italic">See United States Customs Serv., Customs Mgmt. Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA 809, 814 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the parties have contractually agreed that only the first prong of the "covered by" test will apply to their negotiations. The Agency does not dispute this claim. In addition, the Agency frames its argument as a claim that the subject matter of the proposal is "expressly contained in" Article 67, Section 3 of the parties' agreement. In these circumstances, we apply only the first prong of the "covered by" test. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(2) ("Failure to respond to an argument or assertion raised by the other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to such argument or assertion.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 67, Section 3 of the parties' agreement provides the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If an employee's developmental training is interrupted for thirty (30) days or more, the employee shall be granted sufficient training time to attain the level of proficiency he/she had at the time of the interruption, prior to the resumption of the remaining allotted training hours. The employee's evaluations and/or training reports shall be used by the Agency to determine when the employee's former level of proficiency has been re-attained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union explains, and the Agency does not dispute, that developmental controllers are allotted a total number of training hours to obtain certification, and if they cannot obtain certification within that prescribed allotment, then they may be removed from the training program. The Union asserts that Article 67, Section 3 was intended to avoid such potential removals by allowing employees additional developmental training time after that training has been interrupted. According to the Union, Article 67, Section 3 provides only for additional training time and does not expressly address the compensation that employees will receive when their promotions are delayed by interruptions in their developmental training. According to the Agency, the subject matter of the proposal is expressly contained in Article 67, Section 3, because that contract provision "specifically addresses the effects of developmental training delays."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, the subject matter of proposals has been found "covered by" an agreement under the first prong of the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> test where the proposals would have modified and/or conflicted with the express terms of a contract provision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Denver, Colo.</span>, 60 FLRA 572, 573-74 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (proposal permitting employees with approved annual leave to transfer that leave to other employees without regard to whether other, more senior employees were seeking leave for the same time would have "circumvented" contract provision stating that management would resolve leave request conflicts on basis of seniority), <span class="Italic">reconsid. denied</span>, 60 FLRA 893 (2005), <span class="Italic">appeal docketed,</span> No. 05-1230 (D.C. Cir. July 1, 2005); <span class="Italic">Prof'l Airways Sys. Specialists</span>, 56 FLRA 798, 804 (2000) (proposal directing that training be made available to certain employees, and contract provision stating that the employer would determine individual training needs); <span class="Italic">id.</span> (proposal entitling certain employees to save grade and save pay, and contract provision stating that save grade and save pay would be granted to the extent permissible by specified laws); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, United States Army Enlisted Records &#x0026; Evaluation Ctr. Fort Benjamin Harrison, Ind.</span>, 48 FLRA 31, 38-39 (1993) (proposal providing for specific means of how paychecks would be delivered, and contract provision providing for specific means of how paychecks would be delivered and process for seeking exceptions to listed means).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Authority has found proposals not to be expressly contained in contract provisions where the proposals did not modify and/or conflict with the express terms of the contract provisions even if the proposals concerned the same general range of matters addressed in the provisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 56 FLRA 906, 911-12 (2000) (employees' relocations within a building were not expressly contained in provision involving, among other things, changes in post-of-duty); <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv., Customs Mgmt. Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA 809, 814 (2000) (administrative leave to attend and participate in a particular athletic competition was not expressly contained in provisions discussing circumstances under which occasional administrative leave would be provided and providing for excused time for exercise); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 43, 46-47 (1998) (videotaping employee interviews was not expressly contained in provision setting forth employees' right to verbatim transcript of any interview for which a "tape recording" or stenographic record was made),<span class="Italic"> decision after remand</span>, 56 FLRA 398 (2000) (Chairman Wasserman concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency correctly asserts that Article 67, Section 3 of the parties' agreement addresses the effects of developmental training delays. In this regard, Article 67, Section 3 addresses additional time for an employee to complete his or her developmental training. The proposal addresses a different matter. Specifically, the proposal addresses compensation that an employee will receive after he or she completes his or her developmental training and is certified. The proposal would not modify or otherwise conflict with the express terms of Article 67, Section 3, and a "reasonable reader" would not conclude that Article 67, Section 3 "settles the matter" of whether employees are entitled to receive compensation for promotions that are delayed as a result of ATOP training. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018. In these circumstances, we find that the Union's proposal is not "expressly contained in" the collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's claim that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it is "covered by" the parties' agreement.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As it is undisputed that only the first prong of the "covered by" test applies, we do not resolve whether the proposal would be "covered by" the contract under the second prong.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the context of arbitration, the "covered by" doctrine applies only to an alleged unlawful refusal to bargain, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1916 and Dept. of Energy, Nat'l Energy Technology Lab.</span>, 64 FLRA 532, 533 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "covered by" doctrine excuses parties from an obligation to bargain on the basis that they have already bargained and reached agreement concerning a disputed matter. <span class="Italic">E.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Headquarters, Balt., Md., </span>57 FLRA 459, 460 (2001) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). It "applies <span class="Italic">only </span>in cases alleging an unlawful refusal to bargain." <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 64 FLRA 199, 202 (2009) (Member Beck dissenting as to another matter) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not allege that the Agency unlawfully refused to bargain.&#x2003;Although the Union claims that the agreement did not permit the Agency to implement the new standard, the Union does not seek to bargain over the new standard. Moreover, as specifically noted by the Arbitrator, the Union conceded that the Agency had the right to modify or add to performance standards during the term of the agreement when consistent with the agreement. Accordingly, the "covered by" doctrine does not apply. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Based on the foregoing, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1243"></span>The "covered by" doctrine found definition in the context of an arbitration involving the alleged failure to bargain over impact and implementation of practices affecting work assignments. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Council of Prison Locals</span>, 63 FLRA 132, 135-36 (2009), considered whether a matter was expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement or was nonetheless inseparably bound up with and an aspect of a subject covered by the terms of the agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's claim that the award is contrary to law because the use of the critical roster program is "covered by" Article 18 of the parties' CBA and thus it has no duty to bargain with the Union over this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the "covered by" doctrine is a well established defense to a claim that an agency failed to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Denver, Colo</span>., 60 FLRA 572, 573 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Wash., D.C.,</span> 56 FLRA 45, 53 (2000). In this regard, the "covered by" doctrine excuses parties from bargaining on the ground that they have already bargained and reached agreement concerning the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Social Security Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1015 (1993). The doctrine has two prongs. Under the first prong, if a party seeks to bargain over a matter that is expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, then the other party may properly refuse to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv.</span>, <span class="Italic">Customs Mgmt. Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA 809, 814 (2000). Under the second prong, if a matter is not expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, but is nonetheless inseparably bound up with and, thus, an aspect of a subject covered by the terms of the agreement, then the other party may also properly refuse to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency, by terminating the discussion concerning the critical roster program before undertaking serious discussions of "appropriate...arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of [management's right to undertake]" this program, "failed to comply with its obligations under the provisions of the [CBA] calling for negotiations over changes in conditions of employment, as well as under...&#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) governing permissible matters over which the Union may initiate negotiations[,]" and directed the Agency to bargain concerning the matter. Although the Arbitrator did not explicitly state that the Agency failed to satisfy a statutory bargaining obligation, the Arbitrator, by finding that the Agency failed to comply with its obligations under the provisions of the CBA, which requires negotiations over changes in conditions of employment, "where required by [&#x00A7;&#x00A7;] 7106, 7114, and 7117...prior to implementation of any policies, practices and/or procedures[,]" implicitly implied that the Agency failed to satisfy a statutory bargaining obligation as well. Thus, we address the Agency's claim that the critical roster program is "covered by" Article 18 of the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, as relevant here, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that Article 18, which concerns "Hours of Work," provides for the formulation of "Quarterly [R]osters." In this respect, Article 18, Section (d), provides, in part, that "'seven (7) weeks prior to the upcoming quarter the [Agency] will ensure that a blank roster for the upcoming quarter will be posted in an area that is accessible to all correctional staff, for the purpose of giving those employees advance notice of assignments, days off, and shifts that are available for which they will be given the opportunity to submit their preference requests.'" With respect to the critical roster program, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that this program concerned an Agency "initiative" involving Agency rosters that eliminated those posts which "[m]anagement...deemed not to be critical to carrying out" its mission, and in which affected employees assigned to those posts were reassigned--many from "specialized positions" filled through merit promotions--to correctional officer positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Arbitrator's factual finding, we find nothing in Article 18 that concerns the critical roster program. Article 18 concerns hours of work, and among other things, Quarterly Rosters, which are prepared on a quarterly basis, wherein employees are given advanced notice of assignments, days off, and available shifts for which they may submit their preference requests. On the other hand, the critical roster program concerns an initiative where an employee's specialized position or post obtained through merit promotion is abolished and the employee is reassigned to a correctional officer position, where the employee now has to "compete on the basis of seniority in a much larger poll of employees for shifts, posts, days off and scheduling of annual leave[.]" Although the matter involved here concerns a roster, there is nothing to show that Article 18 addresses critical rosters that involve the elimination of specialized positions or post assignments filled through merit promotions and the reassignment of employees filling those positions to correctional office positions. We find, therefore, that the critical roster program is not expressly contained in Article 18 or inseparably bound up with the matters contained in that provision. Accordingly, we find that the critical roster program is not covered by Article 18 of the CBA.</p>
