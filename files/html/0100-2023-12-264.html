<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-263"><span class="space">b.</span> Procedures; Timeliness of Grievance</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is inclined to allow arbitrators to conduct their hearings without being held to the same standards that might govern hearings convened by AJs, <span class="Italic">Costa v. DOD</span>, 88 MSPR 293, 297-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that the arbitrator improperly allowed one of the witnesses to testify by phone, over his objection, and improperly allowed her to testify despite the fact that she had made a written statement that was not provided to him. We do not find that the appellant has shown by these claims that he was denied due process since the claims fall short of establishing any abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cf. Coleman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 51 MSPR 155, 158 (1991) (arbitrator erred as a matter of law in ordering that, if the appellant failed to meet the conditions of reinstatement, the agency could remove him without advance notice or appeal rights). Nor do we find that the appellant has, by his claims, established that the arbitrator's rulings prior to and during the hearing amounted to error on his part in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation. In so finding, we acknowledge that arbitration is a "bargained-for 'part of...self-government created by and confined to the parties,'" <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d 421, 432 (D.C. Cir. 1983) [footnote omitted], and that, because it plays a "unique role in labor-management relations," <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 30 MSPR at 395, arbitration awards are entitled to a greater degree of deference than initial decisions issued by the Board's administrative judges<span class="Italic">. See Bean</span>, 55 MSPR at 612.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant further alleges that, during the hearing, the arbitrator excluded certain evidence and testimony deemed material by the appellant. Again, this contention does not indicate that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation, and, absent legal error, the Board cannot substitute its conclusions for the arbitrator's, even if it would disagree with his findings<span class="Italic">. See Bennett v. National Gallery of Art</span>, 79 MSPR 285, 297-98 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Herrera v. DHS,</span> CB-7121-11-0025-V-1 (NP 1/20/2012) (deferring to the decision of an arbitrator to dismiss a grievance for lack of union diligence in proceeding to a hearing; noting that the Board evaluates an allegation of bias of an arbitrator under the same standards applied to bias allegations against administrative judges), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Herrera v. DHS</span>, 498 Fed. Appx. 35 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether an arbitrator improperly concluded that an appellant elected a remedy by allowing the union to file an unfair labor practice charge related to aspects of her case, leading the arbitrator to conclude he lacked jurisdiction over a grievance challenging her removal, was a substantive matter that the Board reviewed as an error of law. The Board remanded the case to the arbitrator for proper adjudication. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 478, 2007 MSPB 209 (2007) (removal reversed following remand and second review request, <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 5, 2008 MSPB 249 (2008)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HOLLINGSWORTH_KIMBERLY_CB_7121_10_0016_V_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_578359.pdf">115 MSPR 636</a>, 638-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9, 2011 MSPB 26 (2011) (when an arbitrator failed to resolve a claim for compensatory damages but found discrimination, on a request for review the Board remanded the case to one of its judges for analysis of the claim) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 117 MSPR 327, 2012 MSPB 12 (2012) (awarding pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board proclaims that it defers to the arbitrator's construction of the contract, <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC</span>, 105 MSPR 677, 697 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 47-48, 2007 MSPB 140 (2007), determined that interpretation of a contract on a procedural point involving the timeliness of the processing of a grievance was a matter of contract interpretation and a matter of law, that the Board could review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, as interpreter of the contract. In <span class="Italic">Morales v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MORALES_SONIA_CB_7121_07_0020_V_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_302050.pdf">107 MSPR 360</a>, 363-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-16, 2007 MSPB 287 (2007), the Board determined that it could review an inherently procedural issue involving operation of the grievance process, based on the review authority it possessed when an arbitration decision was challenged before the Board through an allegation of discrimination involving an action otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of the Board's review of arbitration decisions is limited. In comparison with initial decisions subject to Board review under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115, arbitration decisions are entitled to greater deference and will be set aside only where the arbitrator has erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Dobruck;</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 578, &#x00B6; 11;<span class="Italic"> see Robinson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 389, 395-96, <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 479 (1986). Accordingly, even if the Board would disagree with the arbitrator's factual findings and interpretation of the evidence, absent legal error, the Board cannot substitute its conclusions for those of the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Social Security Administration,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 13 (2003). We note that the arbitrator's interpretation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement is a legal matter, which is fully reviewable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Gunn v. Veterans Administration Medical Center, Birmingham, Ala.,</span> 892 F.2d 1036, 1038 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the arbitrator committed legal error in finding that the union's failure to timely schedule her oral presentations was dispositive under the collective bargaining agreement and rendered her grievances nongrievable and nonarbitrable. Rather, the appellant contends that the requested oral presentations were only an option available to her under the collective bargaining, and, since they were optional, her written grievances should have been considered as a sufficient written presentation to require the agency to render decisions on the merits of her grievances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no basis, under the deferential standard described above, for disturbing the arbitrator's finding that the appellant failed to act in a timely manner with respect to the scheduling of the oral presentations that she requested. We also see no basis for attributing this failure to the agency. As explained further below, however, we do not concur in the arbitrator's interpretation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, we do not agree that the agreement is properly construed as requiring or permitting termination of the grievances when the grievant fails to schedule her oral or written presentations in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator's finding that the collective bargaining agreement required either an oral or a written presentation at Step 3 of the grievance procedure appears to be based on his interpretation of Article 24, Section 9, of the agreement. That section provides, with respect to Step 3 of the grievance procedure, that, "[i]f the Step 3 official is not located in the same installation as the grievant, the grievant shall have ten (10) workdays to make an oral and/or written presentation." It provides further that "[t]he Step 3 official or designee will as speedily as possible, attempt to resolve the grievance and will within ten (10) workdays after the Step 3 <span id="Page_1858"></span>presentation date give a written decision containing the reason for the decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see nothing in the language quoted above, or elsewhere in the collective bargaining agreement, that supports a finding that the appellant was required to make an oral or written presentation (other than the written statements in the grievance itself) at the relevant step of the grievance procedure. As the agency seems to acknowledge in its response to the appellant's request for review, the language quoted above indicates only that a grievant has a right to make such a presentation.<span class="Italic"> See</span> RRF, Tab 4 at 13 (the agency's statement that "oral presentations may be optional," and that "a management official may issue a written decision in a grievance without the benefit of an oral presentation...if an oral presentation is not requested"). Moreover, we see nothing else in the agreement that indicates that an oral or written presentation was required. While the agreement includes provisions describing information that is to be included in the grievance itself, it does not refer to any circumstances under which any further information must be provided, either orally or in writing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that, even though an oral presentation is not generally required under the collective bargaining agreement, one must be made when the grievant has requested the opportunity to make one. It notes that the appellant checked a box on the grievance forms indicating that she was requesting such an opportunity; it asserts that the agreement "contains no provision...which allows any management official to dismiss a request for an oral presentation at any step of the grievance process"; and it argues that the agreement's provision that the responsible management official "must hold a meeting or, if one is not requested, issue a decision in writing" means that "a management official may issue a written decision in a grievance without the benefit of an oral presentation only if an oral presentation is not requested." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the plain language in the collective bargaining agreement governs the outcome of this case; however, we find that the arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in construing the agreement as he did. In particular, we find, as the appellant contends, that the collective bargaining agreement did not require the appellant to make an oral or written presentation in order to be entitled to receive a decision on the merits, and it did not require, or authorize, Brady to deny the grievances under the circumstances presented in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants in Board appeals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, like grievants under the collective bargaining agreement at issue here, are provided with a right to a hearing. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). When an appellant has requested a hearing, however, and when he subsequently fails to take appropriate action to enable such a proceeding to be held, he does not forfeit his right to a decision on the merits of his appeal. Instead, he forfeits only his right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Callahan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 748 F.2d 1556, 1557-60 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (remanding appeal to the Board for adjudication on the record, without a hearing, after the appellant failed without justification to appear at the hearing that had been scheduled at his request). We see no basis for finding that this rule is not equally applicable to oral presentations requested under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in his interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement provision at issue here, that the agreement does not permit the agency to terminate the processing of a grievance based on the appellant's failure to act in a diligent and timely manner in pursuing her right to an oral or written presentation; and that the arbitrator therefore erred in finding the appellant's grievances not arbitrable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board retreated from <span class="Italic">Morales</span> in <span class="Italic">Fanelli v. USDA</span>, 109 MSPR 115, 117-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-14, 2008 MSPB 124 (2008), restoring the Board's earlier deference to arbitrators' rulings on procedural issues--including timeliness of grievances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective April 23, 2004, the agency removed the appellant from the position of Microbiologist, GS-11, based on his failure to follow procedures. The appellant elected to grieve his removal through the agency's negotiated grievance procedure by submitting a May 13, 2004 letter to John P. Cherry, the deciding official and Center Director, through which the appellant sought to initiate a Step 3 grievance in accordance with Article XXIV, Section 8, of the Negotiated Agreement between the agency and the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1331, AFL-CIO. The appellant supplemented his May 13, 2004 letter with a May 23, 2004 letter, in which he argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency's removal decision "was motivated by discrimination based on reprisal for [his] prior [equal employment opportunity (EEO)] activity." On June 10, 2004, Cherry issued a written decision finding that the appellant's grievance was untimely filed and deficient, and that the appellant had elected to proceed in a different forum. The matter eventually was submitted to arbitration, and after convening a bifurcated hearing to resolve only the threshold issues of timeliness and the sufficiency of the appellant's Step 3 grievance, the arbitrator deemed the matter resolved under the terms of the Negotiated Agreement, finding that the appellant's Step 3 grievance was untimely filed. Based on his finding on the issue of timeliness, the arbitrator made no findings as to whether the appellant's grievance was deficient under the terms of the Negotiated Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review an arbitration decision under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) where the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant has alleged discrimination as stated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action, and a final decision has been issued. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Social Security Administration</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 5 (2003); <span class="Italic">see In re Ogden Air Logistics Center and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1592</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 630 (1981). Each of those elements has been satisfied in this case. First, the subject matter of the grievance, a removal under chapter 75, title 5 of the United States Code, falls within the scope of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1). Second, while retaliation for exercising appeal, grievance, or complaint rights is generally covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), the Board has held in the context of arbitration cases that an allegation of reprisal for engaging in protected EEO activity may also be recognized under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">E.g., Dwyer v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 632, &#x00B6; 4 (2008). And third, the final decision of the arbitrator has been issued in this case. We therefore find that the Board has jurisdiction over this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his request for review, the appellant argues that the arbitrator erred by "isolat[ing] and focus[ing] on a portion of the language set forth in Article [XXIV], &#x00A7; 8, Step 3, without consideration of the entire language of Article [XXIV]." The appellant claims that, because grievances under Step 1 must be initiated within 20 days of the event that gave rise to the grievance, his Step 3 grievance should likewise have been accorded a 20-day filing period.<span class="Italic"></span> The arbitrator's interpretation of the Negotiated Agreement, according to the appellant, "ignored the context of the [relevant] provision and all the language within the provision." The appellant also argues that the agency should be estopped from denying his grievance on timeliness grounds, given that the agency failed to "immediately notify the union" of the untimeliness of the grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard of the Board's review of an arbitrator's award is narrow; such awards are entitled to a greater degree of deference than initial decisions issued by the Board's administrative judges. <span class="Italic">De Bow v.

It is well-established that an arbitrator is uniquely qualified to interpret a CBA and that it is the source of his authority and his task to effectuate the intent of the parties through the 5 interpretation and application of that agreement. <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 47 (2007); <span class="Italic">cf. Bross v. Department of Commerce</span>, 389 F.3d 1212, 1216 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case raises a question as to the Board's proper standard of review in cases where an appellant contests an arbitrator's interpretation of a purely procedural provision of a CBA. As noted above, the Board has long held that arbitrator awards are entitled to a higher level of deference and that the Board will modify or set aside an arbitration decision only where the arbitrator has erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">E.g., De Bow</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 5. The Board has applied that standard of review in cases where the determinative issue results from an arbitrator's interpretation of a CBA provision involving a purely procedural issue, deferring, without further discussion, to the arbitrator's interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Hackerman v. Social Security Administration</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 23, 26 (1996) (deferring to an arbitrator's interpretation of a CBA provision involving the forum in which the appellant first elected to appeal his demotion); <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Department of the Army</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 392, 394 (1996) (deferring to an arbitrator's interpretation of a CBA provision involving the timeliness of the grievance).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1859"></span>In <span class="Italic">Morales v. Social Security Administration</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 360 (2007), however, the Board gave greater scrutiny to an arbitrator's interpretation of a purely procedural provision of a CBA. There, the appellant timely filed written grievances of the agency's decision to deny her a within-grade increase and its subsequent decision to remove her. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3. At the time of her grievance filing, the appellant requested an opportunity to make oral presentations in support of each grievance, which apparently was optional under the parties' CBA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 3. Because the oral presentations were not scheduled within the time period allotted under the CBA, however, the Step 3 grievance official denied the appellant's grievances, finding that the grievances failed to meet the requirements 6 of the CBA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 4. The matter was submitted to arbitration, and the arbitrator denied the appellant's grievances as not arbitrable, finding that the CBA required the appellant to make a written or oral presentation at Step 3 of the grievance procedure, and that the appellant's failure to schedule such a presentation within the timeframe set forth in the CBA precluded the grievances from being arbitrable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 5. On review, the Board found no language in the CBA that "require[d] the appellant to make an oral or written presentation in order to be entitled to receive a decision on the merits, and it did not require, or authorize, [the Step 3 grievance official] to deny the grievances under the circumstances presented in [that] case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 14. Thus, the Board found that the arbitrator acted improperly, and erred as a matter of law, by basing the denial of the appellant's grievances on an interpretation of the CBA that lacked any foundation in the terms of the CBA for such an interpretation. The Board also acknowledged similarities in that case with direct Board appeals brought under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, in which an appellant may request a hearing but not forfeit his right to a decision on the merits of his appeal "when he subsequently fails to take appropriate action to enable such a proceeding to be held." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Morales</span> did not cite <span class="Italic">Sweeney</span> or <span class="Italic">Hackerman</span>. Therefore, the question arises as to whether <span class="Italic">Morales</span> overruled <span class="Italic">sub silentio</span> the Board's past deferential standard of review in such cases. We take this opportunity to revisit the issue and to now clarify the proper standard of review to be applied in cases where, as here, an appellant requests that the Board disturb an arbitrator's interpretation of a purely procedural provision of a CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal common law has created a principle of judicial deference to arbitral decisions under a functional standard which recognizes arbitration's unique role in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 581, 591-92 (1987), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Berkey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 24, 27-28 (1989). Quoting the United States Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &#x0026; Car Corp.</span>, 7 363 U.S. 593 (1960), which related to private-sector arbitration, the Board has noted that, while arbitrators are not authorized simply to dispense their own brand of "justice," "any [arbitration] award that 'draws its essence from the [CBA]' is entitled to judicial deference." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 591. "An arbitrator's award should only be vacated when his words 'manifest an infidelity to this obligation,' and...in making this determination, any doubts concerning the propriety of the merits of an arbitrator's decision must be resolved in favor of the decision." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 591 (quoting <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers</span>, 363 U.S. at 597). Although those findings relate to arbitration decisions in the private sector, the Board also has noted that "[a]n equally deferential standard of review has been sanctioned for arbitral decisions in the public sector." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 591; <span class="Italic">see Robinson</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 395-96.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such reasoning is also supported by well-established holdings of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). Although FLRA precedent is not binding on the Board, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 542, 554 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Hubbard v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 205 F.3d 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2000), the Board has relied upon the FLRA's reasoning in certain contexts, as appropriate, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Smith v. Department of Energy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (noting the FLRA's holding that the enforceability of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures continues upon the expiration of a CBA, absent an express agreement by the parties to the contrary). Such guidance is particularly appropriate where a Board decision would result in a disparity between the treatment of arbitration cases before the Board and the FLRA, which would tend to encourage forum shopping in contravention of Congress's intent in enacting the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. <span class="Italic">See Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 25, 29-30 (1984). The FLRA's standard of review of arbitration decisions is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a), which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of this title). If upon review the Authority finds that the award is deficient--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Authority may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting section 7122(a), the FLRA has held consistently that an arbitration award is deficient when it fails to draw its essence from the CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The FLRA will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the [CBA] when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 273</span>, 62 FLRA No. 65, 2008 WL 656240 (Mar. 5, 2008) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Department of Labor and National Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 34 F.L.R.A. 573 (1990)). Unlike the FLRA's standard of review, which is expressly set forth under section 7122(a), the Board's standard of review in arbitration cases brought under section 7121(d) is not governed by an express statutory mandate; rather, the Board's standard is the product of case law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Williams</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 591-92; <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 392-96. In light of the Board's past treatment of these issues, as well as Congress's intent to prevent forum shopping between the Board and the FLRA, we find the FLRA's approach instructive as to the extent to which the Board should defer to an arbitrator's interpretation of a purely procedural provision of a CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon review of the record before the Board, we discern no basis for finding that the arbitrator's interpretation failed to draw its essence from the Negotiated Agreement, that his interpretation manifested an infidelity to this obligation, or that he erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation; thus, the appellant has not overcome the greater degree of deference afforded to arbitration decisions. <span class="Italic">See De Bow</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 5. In relevant part, the Negotiated Agreement sets forth a three-step procedure for pursuing a grievance. Under Step 1, within a 20-day period following the event giving rise to the grievance, or knowledge thereof, a grievant must attempt to informally resolve the matter with his immediate supervisor. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved within 7 days, the grievant has 10 days within which to submit a written Step 2 grievance to the Research Leader, who, in turn, must issue a written determination regarding the grievance within 15 days.<span class="Italic"></span> Finally, under Step 3 of the grievance process, the Negotiated Agreement sets forth the following requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the grievant is not satisfied with the written determination of the Research Leader or designated representative, the grievance may be submitted in writing to the Center Director within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the step 2 decision. The Center Director or designated representative will make appropriate inquiries and will issue a written decision within fifteen (15) calendar days of his/her receipt of the grievance. This is the final decision of the Agency. In unusual circumstances requiring prompt and expeditious resolution, such as but not necessarily limited to serious problems involving the health and safety of employees, steps 1 and 2 of this procedure may be omitted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no indication that the appellant acted improperly by omitting Steps 1 and 2, and instead proceeding directly to a Step 3 grievance, given that the deciding official for the appellant's removal, John P. Cherry, was also the Center Director. Moreover, neither party has 10 suggested that the appellant acted improperly by omitting Steps 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the appellant has not produced evidence or argument sufficient to disturb the arbitrator's findings. In his final decision, the arbitrator weighed both the hearing testimony and the language of the Negotiated Agreement and found that, because the appellant initiated his grievance at the Step 3 level, the 10-day filing period was "the time constraint applicable" in this case. The language of the Negotiated Agreement supports the arbitrator's finding. As noted above, a Step 3 grievance must be filed within 10 days of receipt of a Step 2 decision. Although the Negotiated Agreement is silent as to whether the 10-day filing period also applies to situations where, as here, a grievant initiates the grievance process at the Step 3 level, the arbitrator's interpretation of the relevant provision of the Negotiated Agreement was reasonable under the circumstances. The Negotiated Agreement provides that, "[i]n unusual circumstances..., steps 1 and 2 of this procedure may be omitted"; however, it contains no suggestion that a grievant may rely upon the Step 1 deadline in filing his Step 3 grievance. The fact that the Negotiated Agreement expressly permits Step 1 to be omitted, as the appellant has acknowledged in this case, belies his claim that he could reasonably expect that the filing period provided under Step 1 was applicable to his Step 3 grievance. Further, the appellant has not cited a <span id="Page_1860"></span>single instance in which the Negotiated Agreement, in effect for more than 16 years prior to his removal, had been interpreted to apply the 20-day filing deadline under Step 1 to a situation where, as here, a grievant proceeded directly to Step 3 of the grievance procedure. Indeed, the local union president, Brien Sullivan, testified that, to grieve a removal made by the Center Director, the Negotiated Agreement requires, under Step 3 of the negotiated procedure, that the grievance be filed within 10 calendar days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Morales</span>, the appellant in the present request for review has not established that the arbitrator's interpretation failed to draw its essence from the Negotiated Agreement or that his interpretation manifested an infidelity to this obligation, nor has the appellant shown that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation. As discussed above, the arbitrator in this case based his interpretation on the plain language of Article XXIV, Section 8, Step 3 of the Negotiated Agreement, which, though silent as to the exact circumstances at issue here, sets forth a 10-day filing period in which a grievant must file a Step 3 grievance. The appellant has not shown that the arbitrator erred by finding that the deadline set forth under Step 1 of negotiated grievance procedure is inapplicable to a grievance filed under Step 3. Although the Board could have reasonably interpreted Section 8 of Article XXIV and reached a different conclusion than the one reached in the final arbitration decision, the Board's role in arbitration cases is not to make such interpretations in the first instance. Because the arbitrator's interpretation is consistent with the standard discussed above, we will not disturb it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the appellant has not shown that the agency should be estopped from denying his grievance on timeliness grounds based on the agency's purported failure to "immediately notify the union" of the untimeliness of the grievance. The appellant has identified no legal basis, and we have found none, for making such a finding. Rather, as the arbitrator noted, the agency received the appellant's May 23, 2004 supplemental letter on May 27, 2004, and the agency's June 10, 2004 response to the appellant's grievance complied with the 15-day deadline set forth under Step 3 of the grievance process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the arbitrator decides against the grievant on the basis of timeliness of the grievance, the Board reviews the case on an appeal that includes an allegation of discrimination; however, the Board will defer to the arbitrator's decision on a "purely procedural issue--timeliness--not on the interpretation of a law, rule, or regulation within the Board's area of expertise, i.e., civil service law." <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 392, 394 (1996). Other Board decisions were deferential to arbitral procedural determinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Nat'l Gallery of Art</span>, 79 MSPR 285, 298 (1998) (deferring to the arbitrator's determination not to consider allegedly new and material evidence submitted after the hearing); <span class="Italic">Hackerman v. SSA</span>, 72 MSPR 23, 26 (1996) (deferring to the arbitrator's procedural ruling, involving interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, pertaining to an election between grievance and EEO procedures).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reaffirmed its deference to arbitrators' procedural determinations in <span class="Italic">Brookens v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 120 MSPR 678, 684 &#x00B6; 13, 2014 MSPB 27 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board applies the same deferential review standard on the merits of an arbitrator's finding as it does in cases of an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) provision involving a purely procedural issue. <span class="Italic">See Hackerman v. Social Security Administration</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 23, 26 (1996) (deferring to an arbitrator's interpretation of a CBA provision involving the forum in which the appellant first elected to appeal his demotion); <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Department of the Army</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 392, 394 (1996) (deferring to an arbitrator's interpretation of a CBA provision involving the timeliness of the grievance). An arbitrator is uniquely qualified to interpret a CBA, which is the source of the arbitrator's authority. <span class="Italic">See Fanelli v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2008).</p>

Dept. of Labor</span>, CB-7121-13-0180-V-1 n.2 (NP 4/17/2014) (involuntary resignation challenge: "Thus, we note that the issue of jurisdiction is not a purely procedural matter under the collective bargaining agreement, entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fanelli v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-11 (2008). In determining jurisdiction, the arbitrator appropriately sought to apply Board precedent").</p>
