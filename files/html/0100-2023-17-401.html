<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-399"><span class="space">A.</span> REQUIRED FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Because fee awards against the government involve inroads on the government's sovereign immunity, an award must conform to statutory requirements described in the case law outlined below. Fees are not to be awarded as a matter of equity or public interest. <span class="Italic">LIUNA Local 1376 and DHHS, PHS</span>, 54 FLRA 700, 704-05 (1998); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, San Diego and FOP Local 12</span>, 70 FLRA 978 (2018) (Member Abbott concurring) (arbitrator's award concerning distribution of body-armor vests did not support fee award; no statute, e.g., Back Pay Act, FLSA, or EEO law was implicated); <span class="Italic">DODDS and FEA</span>, 54 FLRA 773, 785 n.5 (1998) (Back Pay Act, waiving sovereign immunity, is strictly construed). When there is a choice among the statutory bases for a fee, e.g., the Back Pay Act and the FLSA, the arbitrator should explain the statutory basis of his fee award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and IBEW, Local 80</span>, 57 FLRA 430, 434-35 (2001) ("[T]he Arbitrator did not set forth specific findings or provide any reasons as to why the grievant was entitled to reasonable attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, nor did the Arbitrator, in light of his determination that the grievant was entitled to statutory overtime under the FLSA, explain why attorney fees were not appropriate under the FLSA."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and VAMC Asheville</span>, 58 FLRA 361, 362 (2003) (arbitrator could not deny counsel fees when he awarded back pay under FLSA); <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 529 and Dept. of Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs Memphis</span>, 57 FLRA 784, 786 (2002) (no need for "interest of justice" analysis under Back Pay Act when FLSA mandated fees).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, NUSW Newport and NAGE FUSE Local R1-144</span>, 56 FLRA 477, 478-79 (2000), summarized the determinants of arbitrators' counsel fee awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirement for entitlement to attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596 (Back Pay Act), is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, which resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials....&#8197;Once such a finding is made, the Back Pay Act further requires that an award of fees must be: (1) in conjunction with an award of backpay to the grievant on correction of the personnel action; (2) reasonable and related to the personnel action; and (3) in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), which pertains to attorney fee awards by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) applies to all cases except those involving employment discrimination, and applies in this case. The prerequisites for an award of attorney fees under section 7701(g) are that: (1) the employee must be the "prevailing party"; (2) the award of fees must be warranted in the interest of justice; (3) the amount of the fees must be reasonable; and (4) the fees must have been incurred by the employee....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's award resolving a request for attorney fees under section 7701(g)(1) must set forth specific findings supporting determinations on each pertinent statutory requirement....&#8197;If an award fails to contain the findings necessary to enable the Authority to assess the arbitrator's legal conclusions, and those findings cannot be derived from the record, the case will be remanded to the parties for submission to the arbitrator so that the requisite findings can be made....</p>
<p class="noindent">Remanding a case for further analysis of fee entitlement when an arbitrator granted a temporary promotion with back pay but denied fees, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local 551 and VA, Roudebush Med. Ctr.</span>, 68 FLRA 285, 289 (2015), provided the basics for fee entitlement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirement for entitlement of attorney fees under the BPA is a finding that an employee (1) "ha[s] been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" (2) "which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee."[48] A violation of the parties' agreement constitutes an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action.[49] The Arbitrator made factual findings satisfying each of the threshold requirements for attorney <span id="page_2423"></span>fees under the BPA. In particular, the Arbitrator found that the violation of the parties' agreement: (1) was through "the action of the Agency";[50] and (2) caused the grievant to suffer an actual loss in pay as she qualified to "be paid in an amount equal to any part of the pay of the [higher-graded position] that exceeded that which she [had] received." Contrary to the Arbitrator's ruling that "the action of the Agency did not constitute a withdrawal o[r] reduction of [the g]rievant's pay," these findings satisfy the threshold requirements for an award of attorney fees under the BPA.</p>

Because the Union did not file a petition and the Agency had no opportunity to respond, the award is modified to strike the granting of attorney fees. Upon remand, the Union may file a petition for attorney fees with the Arbitrator and the Agency must have an opportunity to respond.[53] Only then is the Arbitrator empowered to make a determination.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA's discussion of the essentials of a fee award was initially developed in <span class="Italic">IBEW and Army Support Command, Hawaii</span>, 14 FLRA 680, 683-84 (1984). FLRA determined that under 5 USC 5596, to obtain fees, the grievant must have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of his pay, allowances, or differentials. The award must be in conjunction with an award of back pay on correction of the personnel action, the award must be reasonable and related to the personnel action, and the award must be in accordance with standards established under 5 USC 7701(g). Under the latter statute, the employee must be the prevailing party to obtain fees, the award must be in the interest of justice (other than in a case involving discrimination), the fee must be reasonable, and it must have been incurred by the employee. Section 7701(g)(2), pertaining to cases of discrimination prohibited by 5 USC 2302(b)(1), requires that the award be in accordance with the standards under &#x00A7; 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-5(k). The standards of 5 USC 7701(g) require a fully articulated, reasoned decision setting forth the specific findings supporting the determination on each pertinent statutory requirement, including the reasonableness of the amount awarded. An award of counsel fees will not be sustained that only quotes a portion of the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, and then summarily concludes that the application of the statutory requirements results in entitlement to the requested fees. There must be a fully articulated, reasoned decision. <span class="Italic">NAATS and FAA, Washington Flight Serv. Station</span>, 20 FLRA 746, 747 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">Basic determinants of fee awards in arbitration cases were discussed in <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1928, AFL-CIO</span>, 21 FLRA 131 (1986). At issue was the award of fees as to an underlying award of environmental differential pay to a group of grievants. FLRA's decision included the opinion of Chairman Calhoun, followed by a separate concurrence of Member Frazier. The decision written by Mr. Calhoun is discussed here. The decision first noted that there are prerequisites to a fee award: the arbitrator must possess the statutory authority to award fees, and he may award fees in a variety of unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions, including but not limited to actions subject to the negotiated grievance procedure or relating to an unfair labor practice; additionally, the Back Pay Act extends counsel fees to omissions or failures to take an action or to confer a benefit. The decision recognized that, although 5 USC 7701(g) applies to an MSPB decision, the Back Pay Act and jurisdiction of arbitrators extends to a significantly wider range of matters than those within the purview of the MSPB. Many questions heard by arbitrators involve grievances brought to secure a benefit for groups of employees. Because of the distinctions between MSPB and arbitration cases, MSPB precedent could be considered instructive but not exclusive. FLRA's decision went on to describe the considerations in each of five criteria for fee awards: (1) compensable service by counsel; (2) on behalf of a prevailing party; (3) if the fee is in the interest of justice; (4) if the fee is reasonable; and (5) if the fee is awarded in a properly articulated arbitration award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr.</span>, 21 FLRA at 136, the first criterion was that "[f]ees must be incurred for the services of an attorney." That means that an attorney-client relationship is required. The second criterion, prevailing party status, is satisfied if the grievant has obtained all or a significant part of the relief sought. Technical victories are not enough. But the party need not prevail on all issues; it is sufficient to prevail on a significant, separable claim on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent">The third issue discussed in <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr.</span> was the "interest of justice," a phrase, taken from 5 USC 7701(g), that has caused much litigation before the MSPB and the courts. The criterion was defined by Chairman Calhoun, 21 FLRA at 137-39:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The MSPB in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> [2 MSPR 420 (1980)] held that the interest of justice standard includes, but is not limited to, cases involving prohibited personnel practices, agency actions clearly without merit, agency actions taken in bad faith to harass or exert improper pressure on an employee, agency gross procedural error which prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee, and cases where the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. I believe that in defining and applying the parameters of the "interest of justice" standard, arbitrators should consider these factors as further clarified and augmented below. This compilation of factors, however, is not intended to be all-inclusive; rather, additional considerations should be applied where relevant and appropriate to individual cases and arbitrators are to be guided by both equity and logic. Illustrative examples gleaned from MSPB and court cases are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;Instances where the agency presents little or no evidence to support its actions or demonstrates either a lack of or negligent preparation of the case. This includes instances where the agency's action lacks substantial justification or is totally unfounded and clearly without merit. For example, a situation where the agency's careful reading of the relevant statutes and regulations would have promptly shown that its interpretation was erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;Instances where agency ill will, or negligence, tainted the action against the employee to an unconscionable degree. This may be inferred from agency action or inaction throughout the proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">c.&#x2003;Instances where the agency initiated action against an employee in disregard of prevailing law, regulations, or negotiated agreement provisions or federal policy. Examples include action based on improper denial of overtime, environmental differential pay, shift differentials, hazardous duty pay, annual leave, administrative leave, or official time for representational functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">d.&#x2003;Instances where the employee is ultimately found to be substantially innocent of the charges brought by the agency. This determination is made on the basis of the result of the appeal rather than on the evidence and information available to the agency at the time the agency effected the action. This standard is not met, however, where the employee believes that he or she is substantially innocent, can prove his or her innocence, and deliberately does not communicate all of the facts to the agency deciding official where the employee's disclosure would reasonably have caused the agency official to modify or overturn the action. Such an employee deliberately and improperly prolongs the agency's legal proceedings and cannot be regarded as an innocent victim who is entitled to attorney fees in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2424"></span>e.&#x2003;Instances where the agency fails to inquire into facts presented by the employee or fails to conduct a prudent inquiry into the employee's contradictory evidence. For example, had an agency inquired into the facts presented by the employee, the agency would or should have ascertained at the outset that the charges against the employee were without merit or that the grievance should have been sustained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">f. Instances where there is either a service rendered to the federal work force or there is a benefit to the public derived from maintaining the action. For example, situations where an employee's grievance leads to correction of workplace problems affecting a segment of the workplace, as in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The fourth factor is the reasonableness of the fee, considered after entitlement has been established. One example of a means of determining reasonableness is the "lodestar" method, involving multiplication of the customary billing rate by the hours reasonably devoted to the case, reduction of the hours to be justified by detailed findings. The lodestar fee is subject, under the FLRA interpretation in <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr.</span>, to contingency fee arrangements and to adjustment for extremely difficult cases or extensive expertise of counsel not reflected in the hourly rate; these adjustments are supported by the party proposing the adjustment. FLRA added that the fee is not to be reduced downward because a party did not prevail on every contention raised. But the possibility of contingency enhancement was eviscerated by the later pronouncements by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 112 S. Ct. 2638 (1992), ruling that contingency enhancements are inappropriate under federal fee-shifting statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, FLRA required a fully articulated, reasoned decision for fees. The decision must include independent and specific analysis, findings, and conclusions on each pertinent statutory requirement including the reasonableness of the amount of fees awarded, <span class="Italic">Naval Air Dev. Ctr.</span>, 21 FLRA at 140-41:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's reference to one party's brief as support for a finding of attorney fees, or a cursory statement that the arbitrator considered the necessary elements of analysis does not meet this test. Rather, such defects create an analytical void which serves to confuse the parties, the public, and the reviewing bodies. As an arbitrator's award must draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement, so too must an arbitrator's award of attorney fees draw its essence from a demonstrable, pragmatic analysis of the factors set out in the applicable statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Frazier offered a concurring opinion centering around the need for explicit and articulated opinions from arbitrators when fee awards are issued. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 144-68. FLRA rejected an award that provided cursory discussion of the reasonableness of the amount of fees in <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and DOD, Alabama NG</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 235 (2000). (Chairman Wasserman, dissenting in part, relying on <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188 and Dept. of Air Force, Johnson AFB</span>, 46 FLRA 458, 463 (1992), suggested both that the award made clear the direction of the arbitrator and that FLRA could set the proper level of fees without a remand).</p>
<p class="noindent">Inherent in the fee analysis is the requirement that counsel fees are reserved for attorneys and those individuals that the attorneys employ (or services they pay for). Reviewing exceptions to an award that denied litigation expenses to a union that prevailed on a grievance without the benefit of counsel, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2030 and Dept. of Interior, BLM</span>, 54 FLRA 626, 628-29 (1998), stated the necessity for the presence of counsel if fees or litigation expenses are to be obtained in arbitration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act authorizes the payment of attorney fees when, as relevant here, an attorney-client relationship exists and the attorney has rendered legal services on behalf of the grievant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Division of Information Resource Management, Atlanta, Georgia and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 53 FLRA 1657, 1661 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>). The attorney fees encompassed by the Back Pay Act include payment of certain expenses.[1] However, as relevant here, only "'those reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses of providing a lawyer's services'" are authorized by the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine and National Association of Agriculture Employees</span>, 53 FLRA 1688, 1693 (1998) (citations omitted). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1140, 1145 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("In the real world of actual law practice...a few variable expenses...must routinely be...billed to clients....") (<span class="Italic">Bennett</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;The Back Pay Act also encompasses certain fees for services rendered by individuals who are not attorneys. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 53 FLRA at 1661-62 (Authority found an award of fees for paralegal services permissible). However, payment of fees for services rendered by individuals who are not attorneys is permitted only where those services are rendered to assist in representation provided by an attorney. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1661. The Union in this case is not requesting reimbursement of any fees paid to its nonattorney representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union concedes that it was not represented by an attorney.&#x2003;Therefore, the Back Pay Act does not provide a basis for requiring payment of the requested expenses. Moreover, even if an attorney-client relationship existed in this case and the Union's request for expenses were encompassed by the Back Pay Act, the Union could not recover all its requested expenses; the costs of obtaining a transcript and the expenses associated with copying documents are not permitted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 785 F.2d 1568, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Bennett</span>, 699 F.2d at 1144.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of an "unequivocal and unambiguous expression of a waiver of sovereign immunity, the payment of Federal money...is not authorized." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Navy Public Works Center, Norfolk, Virginia and Tidewater Virginia Federal Employees, Metal Trades Council</span>, 54 FLRA 338, 342 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392 (1976) and <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187 (1996)). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Missile Range, White Sands, New Mexico and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2049</span>, 38 FLRA 258, 261 (1990) (holding that "it is well established that the expenditure of funds by a Federal Government agency to reimburse litigation costs must be pursuant to a specific statutory authorization"). <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Jack M. Haning</span>, 63 Comp. Gen. 170, 172 (1984). The Union asserts no statutory basis other than the Back Pay Act for the payment of its requested fees and expenses. Accordingly, as the Back Pay Act does not authorize the requested payment, the Arbitrator's award denying the expenses is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA went to some trouble in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot and NAGE Local R14-52</span>, 39 FLRA 1215, 1221 (1991), to make clear that an award of counsel fees does not depend on a contractual authorization of fees; the fee award will normally be a product of statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that unless the provisions of the agreement specifically provided for the granting of attorney fees he lacked authorization to grant attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, the Authority discussed whether the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, 5 C.F.R. part 550, authorize the filing of a request for an award of attorney fees after an arbitrator has issued an award of backpay. The Authority concluded that the Back Pay Act confers jurisdiction on an arbitrator to consider a request for attorney fees either during the arbitration or within a reasonable time after the arbitrator's decision awarding backpay becomes final and binding. 32 FLRA at 420-21.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Arbitrator had jurisdiction under the Back Pay Act to consider and rule on the Union's request for an award of attorney fees. The Arbitrator erred in concluding that he also needed to be specifically authorized by the parties' collective bargaining agreement to award attorney fees because such authority is conferred to him by the Back Pay Act. We note, as stated in <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, that the parties can negotiate into their agreement time limits for filing a request for attorney fees. 32 FLRA at 421. Further, a union may also agree to language that clearly and unmistakably waives its statutory right to attorney fees. In the absence of such contractual limitations in this case, however, we conclude that the Arbitrator had full authority to award attorney fees if such an award complied with the requirements of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">One prerequisite to a fee award is a request for fees. "[T]he Arbitrator may not grant attorney fees under the Back Pay Act in the absence of a fee request." <span class="Italic">EEOC, Baltimore Field Office and AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals</span>, 59 FLRA 688, 694 (2004) (citing 5 CFR 550.807(a)). This is an uncommon. If a request is made to the arbitrator for fees, and the applicant is the prevailing party in a case involving a fee-shifting statute, FLRA will remand an award that fails to address the fee request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 858 and USDA, Risk Mgmt. Agency</span>, 66 FLRA 152, 154 (2011) (FLSA case). Not a prerequisite to a fee award is a hearing on a fee petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Pope Air Force Base, and AFGE Local 1770</span> (<span class="Italic">Union</span>) 71 FLRA 338, 341 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring) ("we agree with the Arbitrator that there is nothing in the damages award, or generally accepted legal principles, which would require an evidentiary hearing on the issue of attorney's fees").</p>
<p class="noindent">If a grievance is determined through several related awards, an arbitrator's earlier award of fees that decides issues of statutory entitlement will be credited by FLRA in successive disputes over entitlement to fees involving the same grievance if the earlier award was not set aside by FLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 69 FLRA 614, 618 (2016) ("However, the content of the instant request for attorney fees cannot be divorced from the underlying disputes that were decided by Arbitrators Gootnick and Meredith.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Much of the law established by FLRA involving counsel fee awards follows the law set by the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The law of those two tribunals concerning fees is considered in Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Merit Systems Protection Board Law and Practice</span> (<a href="http://deweypub.com/mspbguide">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023), Chapter 15.</p>
