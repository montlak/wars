<p class="Body-Text">Relatively few complaints are brought against ALJs. As with the rest of the civil service, most cases involving ALJs are based on inappropriate behavior or poor performance.<span class="Italic"> SSA v. Abruzzo</span>, CB-7521-10-0014-T-1 (NP 8/3/2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Abruzzo v. SSA</span>, 489 Fed. Appx. 449 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), provides a composite view of the scope of issues considered in a complaint against an ALJ. Authorizing removal, <span class="Italic">Abruzzo</span> analyzed charges of alleged poor performance and inappropriate conduct; the Board also considered various defenses, including a hostile environment allegedly caused by a supervisory judge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency sought to remove the respondent from the position of administrative law judge based on the following four charges: (I) Failure to Follow Instructions; (II) Failure to Follow a Direct Order to treat his coworkers and the public with courtesy; (III) Conduct Unbecoming an Administrative Law Judge; and (IV) Failure to Follow a Direct Order to conduct scheduled hearings on August 11, 12, and 13, 2009. Based on the record developed by the parties, including any submissions based on the discovery that the parties conducted and the testimony at the hearing held on July 27-30, 2010, the administrative law judge found that the agency had established good cause to remove the respondent and authorized his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent has petitioned for review. In his petition, the respondent asserts that the agency's action violated judicial independence afforded administrative law judges by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). However, the administrative law judge properly found that Board case law establishes that the instructions and orders that the respondent received were not at odds with an administrative law judge's qualified judicial independence. The Board has allowed administrative law judges to be disciplined for failing to follow instructions. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Manion</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 298 (1984). The Board also has held that an administrative law judge can be disciplined under the good cause standard for refusing to follow a reasonable order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 303; <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Brennan</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 335, 340 (1984). As the administrative law judge found, the order not to directly contact an entity with which the agency did business did not infringe upon the respondent's qualified judicial independence; it was reasonable because it simply required him to follow office procedures that were necessary to maintain good relations with that entity, a relationship essential to the agency's mission. Further, as the administrative law judge found, the agency did not interfere with the respondent's qualified judicial independence and acted reasonably in ordering the respondent to change his pre-hearing order to comply with the agency's rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the Board has held that the agency can discipline an administrative law judge for behavior that fails to show proper courtesy and consideration in dealing with coworkers. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Glover</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 57 (1984). The Board also has held that an administrative law judge can be disciplined for rude and inconsiderate behavior that violates generally accepted rules of conduct, including intemperate language in communications to and about his administrative supervisor. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Burris</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 51, 59 (1988). Here the respondent used intemperate language about his supervisors by telling coworkers that he likened office managers to Nazis and that they were threatening with gas ovens.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board has held that an administrative law judge can be disciplined for refusing to reschedule and conduct hearings. <span class="Italic">Manion</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 301-02. The Board reasoned that agencies must have the power to discipline an administrative law judge for insubordinate and unreasonable refusal to carry out his primary function of hearing and deciding cases. As the administrative law judge found, the agency's order to conduct the hearings was reasonable based on the following: similar to the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Manion</span>, the core mission of the agency is to hear and decide cases and the order did not affect the respondent's ability to provide full and fair hearings and to render impartial and fair decisions; the respondent was well aware of the scheduled hearings; the respondent was available for the hearings because he reported for work on each of the three hearing dates; the claimants had waited for these hearings for as long as 2 years; and the respondent's ostensible reason for not holding the hearing, i.e., that he needed to prepare a response to an adverse action proposed to be taken against him, was not persuasive as the response was not due for a number of weeks after the hearing dates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent admits to the specification of the charge of conduct unbecoming an administrative law judge that he placed a cross made out of what he characterized as "blessed oil" over the Hearing Office Chief's and Hearing Office Director's office doors. As the administrative law judge found, the respondent's actions caused a disruption in the office, causing employees to become concerned and fearful, necessitating removing the respondent from the premises. The respondent's actions caused agency officials to add an additional security guard at the respondent's office and caused agency personnel to expend a great deal of time to investigate and resolve the actions. The administrative law judge properly found that the respondent's actions in placing crosses made of an oily substance over the doors of the Hearing Office Chief and Hearing <span id="Page_2245"></span>Office Director constituted conduct unbecoming an administrative law judge, i.e., conduct that revealed a temperament that detracted from his character or reputation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Miles v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1992) (in order to sustain a charge of conduct unbecoming a Federal employee, the agency must demonstrate that the conduct in question was unattractive, unsuitable, or detracting from the employee's character).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent asserts that the administrative law judge erred in excluding his defense of a hostile workplace and management conspiracy to remove him. Although the administrative law judge limited the respondent's presentation of evidence on these claims to matters relevant to the charges, we find no error in this ruling. Administrative law judges have wide discretion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.48(b)(8), (10) to exclude witnesses where it has not been shown that their testimony would be relevant. <span class="Italic">Franco v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record shows that the administrative law judge properly considered the respondent's defense. For instance, in his discussion of Specification 3 of Charge II, Failure to Follow a Direct Order to treat his coworkers and the public with courtesy, the administrative law judge noted that the respondent was accusing the Hearing Office Chief of "childish harassment and attempting to make [the respondent] a scapegoat." The administrative law judge found that the respondent failed to provide any credible evidence to support his assertion. Additionally, in discussing Specification 4 of Charge II, the administrative law judge noted that the respondent maintains that the Hearing Office Chief was making it more difficult for the respondent to do his job by disallowing him access to the office over a weekend. The administrative law judge found that the Hearing Office Chief denied office access to the respondent on that weekend because staff was upgrading the office computer system on that weekend and, as a result, computers would be unavailable and no staff was allowed access to the office on that weekend. The administrative law judge found that the appellant's response to the denial of access to the office on that weekend, accusing the Hearing Office Chief of interfering with his ability to work while she would "bleat" about serving the agency's customers constituted failure to follow the order to treat coworkers with courtesy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the excluded exhibits that the respondent summarizes in his petition as showing a hostile workplace do not provide persuasive evidence of such. Examples of the exhibits include the following: a reprimand prepared by the Hearing Office Chief; evidence that the Hearing Office Chief forwarded what the respondent characterizes as a routine email authored by him to the region deputy chief; an email chain in which a region attorney states the opinion that the respondent engaged in inappropriate actions; an email chain expressing concern about the respondent's request for information from DDS; a record of a phone conversation in which a DDS staffer said that she "didn't know how much longer they could interact with Judge Abruzzo"; an email from an attorney expressing the opinion that the respondent was "becoming more emotionally unstable"; an email chain among agency officials exploring what action to take if the respondent disregarded an order; and an email from the Hearing Office Chief to the region deputy chief stating that she wanted to share "the games [the respondent] plays."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the respondent asserts that the removal penalty is unreasonable. His assertion is without merit. With respect to the penalty to be imposed on an administrative law judge under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, it is the Board, rather than the agency, that selects the penalty to be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration</span> <span class="Italic">v</span>. <span class="Italic">Anyel</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 261, 274 n.23 (1993). In making the determination, the standards articulated in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), are looked to for guidance. <span class="Italic">See Burris</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. at 64. The administrative law judge considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in determining that the sustained charges warranted removal. The administrative law judge noted that the sustained charges of failure to follow orders were intentional and frequently repeated. The administrative law judge also considered the respondent's prominent role as an administrative law judge and the significance of his failure to carry out the purpose and function of the agency. The administrative law judge additionally properly considered that no lesser penalty would deter the respondent's disregard for agency rules, regulations, and policies and that the Chief Administrative Law Judge testified that he had lost confidence in the respondent's willingness to perform his core duties. The respondent's generally offensive behavior disrupted the workplace, offended co-workers, and violated generally accepted rules of conduct. <span class="Italic">See In re Glover</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 660, 663 (1980). Having considered the nature and seriousness of the sustained charges, the respondent's inappropriate conduct, his 6-year length of service with the agency, and his lack of potential for rehabilitation, the administrative law judge properly found good cause to remove him and authorized his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abruzzo v. SSA</span>, 489 Fed. Appx. 449, 453-55 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), affirmed the decision authorizing the ALJ's removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the underlying misconduct alleged by the SSA in charge three is never denied by Abruzzo, including the specified events that occurred in April 2009. He admits of that incident, in fact, that he "acted improperly." Abruzzo contends instead that the Board applied the wrong standard in determining conduct unbecoming an ALJ. He argues that the standard for this charge is "Highly Subjective And [sic] Circumstance Dependent," and that "there is no reliable way to ascertain the line between innocent conduct and punishable misconduct." He advances no alternative standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the Board applied an acceptable standard here. It described conduct unbecoming as "conduct that revealed a temperament that detracted from character or reputation." <span class="Italic">Abruzzo</span>, 2011 MSPB LEXIS 4754, at *6 (citing <span class="Italic">Miles v</span>. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Army,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1992) (holding that conduct unbecoming is "unattractive, unsuitable, or detracting from the employee's character")). That standard is consistent with a recent articulation reviewed by this court. In <span class="Italic">Long v. SSA</span>, this court reviewed the standard phrased as "conduct that 'undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process,'" including misconduct "relate[d] in some way to the character traits expected of an ALJ," and affirmed the good cause removal of an ALJ for conduct unbecoming. 635 F.3d 526, 533-36 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We sustain the Board's "conduct unbecoming" standard applied here--that which "detracts from the ALJ's character or reputation" before the public. We hold that there was no legal error or abuse of discretion in finding "conduct unbecoming an ALJ."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Improper Orders</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Abruzzo asserts that the intent of the Administrative Procedures Act ("APA") was violated because his supervisors lacked authority to issue the orders in question. Abruzzo claims that his supervisors may only give orders as to "general" or "routine office management." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the ALJ found that all of Abruzzo's supervisors possess authority to issue orders to Abruzzo. <span class="Italic">See Abruzzo</span>, 2010 MSPB LEXIS 5624, at *7-8. Pursuant to the position description, the HOCALJ is supervisory to an ALJ. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We have thus held that discipline may be appropriate for ALJs disregarding instructions from the HOCALJ. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 331 F.3d 1368, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The same authority logically extends to RCALJ Garmon and Chief Judge Cristaudo--both of whom hold positions superior to HOCALJ Barbeito.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, an ALJ, while enjoying qualified judicial independence, is not immune from supervision. <span class="Italic">Brennan</span> v. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 787 F.2d 1559, 1562 &#x0026; n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin. v. Brennan,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 335, 340 (1984). For example, orders requiring that certain material be included or excluded from pre-trial orders; orders requiring that co-workers be treated with respect, courtesy and consideration; and orders requiring the performance of scheduled hearings, have all been found appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Nash v. Bowen,</span> 869 F.2d 675, 680 (2d Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin.</span> v. <span class="Italic">Glover,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 57 (1984); <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin.</span> v. <span class="Italic">Manion,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 298 (1984). The Board's findings that none of the orders at issue actually interfered with Abruzzo's decision-making as a judge are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Penalty Imposed</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Administrative law judges may be removed for "good cause established and determined by the [Board]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a). "Deference is given to the agency's judgment unless the penalty exceeds the range of permissible punishment specified by statute or regulation, or unless the penalty is so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we may overturn a penalty imposed by the Board for an ALJ's misconduct "[o]nly in the exceptional case in which the penalty exceeds that permitted by statute or regulations or is so harsh that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Dep't of Heath and Human Servs.</span>, 787 F.2d 1559, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Abruzzo admits that the events of April 2009 amounted to conduct unbecoming and ALJ, but argues that removal was excessive. Here, the ALJ conducted a very thorough analysis of the factors outlined in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), and found the misconduct intentional, frequent, disruptive, and incompatible with his ability to adequately perform his judicial duties. <span class="Italic">See Abruzzo</span>, 2010 MSPB LEXIS 5624, at *91-97. The Board's findings that Abruzzo cannot effectively serve as an ALJ due to his sustained misconduct does not amount to an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we uphold the Board's penalty of removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board sustains ALJ discipline on broad charges and on charges more narrowly defined. <span class="italic">SSA v. Cooperman</span>, CB-7521-16-0001-T-1 (NP 5/27/2022), said of government-wide regulations defining basic obligations of public service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has described conduct unbecoming an ALJ as "conduct which was improper, unsuitable, or detracting from one's character or reputation." <span class="italic">Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 42. The Board also has held that an agency has proven a charge of conduct unbecoming if it proves that the <span id="Page_2246"></span>employee violated one of the 14 general principles contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b). <span class="italic">Schifano v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 275, 281 (1996). The ALJ relied on the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(8), (b)(14) in his analysis of these specifications.[10] We discern no error with the analytical framework used by the ALJ."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10] The regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(8) states that employees "shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual." Subsection 2635.101(b)(14) states that employees "shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth in this part." Subsection 2635.101(b)(14) further advises that "[w]hether particular circumstances create an appearance that the law or these standards have been violated shall be determined from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pertinent too is the Model Code of Judicial Conduct, <span class="italic">SSA v. Boini</span>, CB-7521-13-0192-T-1 (NP 2/22/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board consistently has held that the position of an administrative law judge is one of prominence and that an administrative law judge must not conduct himself in a manner that undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. <span class="italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 40. This means, at a minimum, that an administrative law judge must not violate generally accepted rules of conduct. <span class="italic">Id</span>. The Board also has found that the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Conduct is an appropriate guide for evaluating the conduct of administrative law judges. <span class="italic">Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 41. The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct underscores that confidence in the judiciary is eroded by both professional and personal misconduct. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of the charge of unbecoming conduct, <span class="Italic">SSA v. White</span>, CB-7521-11-0004-T-1 (NP 4/22/2013), authorizing a 45-day suspension, stated of allegations that the ALJ improperly accessed personal information about individuals not involved in matters before the ALJ; yelled at and was argumentative with representatives at a congressional office; and failed to participate meaningfully in an investigatory meeting conducted by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent first contends that the ALJ failed to correctly state the elements of a charge of conduct unbecoming an ALJ. The Board has described conduct unbecoming an ALJ as "conduct which [is] improper, unsuitable, or detracting from one's character or reputation." <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 42 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Cf. Crouse v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 57, 63 (1997) (defining "unacceptable and inappropriate behavior by a supervisor" as "conduct that [is] improper, or detract[s] from the employee's character or reputation"), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded on other grounds sub nom. Lachance v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 147 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In defining the charge, the ALJ initially cited <span class="Italic">Crouse</span> for the proposition that, in order to prove a charge of conduct unbecoming an ALJ, the agency must establish the following elements by preponderant evidence: (1) the respondent was an ALJ; (2) the respondent engaged in the specified conduct; and (3) the respondent's conduct was unbecoming to her position as an ALJ. The respondent objects that the ALJ's statement of the third element was erroneous in that it encompasses the charge itself and does not include the reference to "character or reputation" found in <span class="Italic">Crouse</span>. However, the ALJ corrected these deficiencies elsewhere in the initial decision by citing <span class="Italic">Long</span> and <span class="Italic">Crouse</span> for the proposition that conduct unbecoming an ALJ means conduct which is improper, unsuitable, or detracts from one's character or reputation. The ALJ went on to find that the respondent's conduct with respect to specifications 1, 2, and 4 of Charge I was improper, unsuitable, and reflected poorly on her character. Thus, to the extent the ALJ may have erred in his initial description of the <span class="Italic">Crouse</span> elements, the error did not compromise his analysis, and therefore provides no basis for reversing his decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
