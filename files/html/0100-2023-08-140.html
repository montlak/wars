<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-139"><span class="space">3.</span> Reemployed Annuitant</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3323, provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Automatic separations; reappointment; reemployment of annuitants</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An individual who reaches the retirement age prescribed for automatic separation applicable to him may not be continued in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. An individual separated on account of age under a statute or regulation providing for retirement on account of age is not eligible for appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. The President, when in his judgment the public interest so requires, may except an individual from this subsection by Executive order. This subsection does not apply to an individual named by a statute providing for the continuance of the individual in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1) Notwithstanding other statutes, an annuitant, as defined by section 8331 or 8401, receiving annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in an appointive position for which the annuitant is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed, other than an annuitant reappointed under paragraph (2) of this subsection, serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Subject to such regulations as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, any annuitant to whom the first sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection applies and who has served as an administrative law judge pursuant to an appointment under section 3105 of this title may be reappointed an administrative law judge under such section for a specified period or for such period as may be necessary for such administrative law judge to conduct and complete the hearing and disposition of one or more specified cases. The provisions of this title that apply to or with respect to administrative law judges appointed under section 3105 of this title shall apply to or with respect to administrative law judges reappointed under such section pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Terrill v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0752-13-0486-I-1 (NP 7/3/2014), added that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(g), an annuitant who becomes reemployed with the Department of Defense continues to receive his annuity unless he elects to be subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344 within 90 days of being informed of this option.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute referenced in <span class="Italic">Terrill</span>, 5 USC 9902, "Department of Defense personnel authorities," provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;Provisions Relating to Reemployment.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided under paragraph (2), if an annuitant receiving an annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund becomes employed in a position within the Department of Defense, his annuity shall continue. An annuitant so reemployed shall not be considered an employee for purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_217"></span>(2)&#x2003;(A) An annuitant retired under section 8336(d)(1) or 8414(b)(1)(A) receiving an annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, who becomes employed in a position within the Department of Defense after the date of enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136), may elect to be subject to section 8344 or 8468 (as the case may be).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;An election for coverage under this paragraph shall be filed not later than the later of 90 days after the date the Department of Defense--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;prescribes regulations to carry out this subsection; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;takes reasonable actions to notify employees who may file an election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;If an employee files an election under this paragraph, coverage shall be effective beginning on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after the date of the filing of the election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(D)&#x2003;Paragraph (1) shall apply to an individual who is eligible to file an election under subparagraph (A) and does not file a timely election under subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An annuitant who has acquired competitive status before his retirement can return to federal service in one of two ways. He may do so...by retaining his annuity (with appropriate salary adjustment) and accepting noncompetitive reinstatement. In accepting such an appointment, the reemployed annuitant serves at the will of the appointing party. 5 USC 3323(b). Alternatively, he may elect to forfeit his annuity and compete for the position, by open examination if that is required. In the latter instance, his previously acquired competitive status would entitle him to the benefits afforded by 5 USC 7513. The acquisition of the status "annuitant" does not permanently negate a former employee's competitive status; however, the statutory scheme does not allow for an employee's deriving benefits from his reemployed annuitant status and his competitive status at the same time. This is reflected in 5 CFR 752.401(c)(12), which codifies the exclusion of reemployed annuitants from the coverage of chapter 75.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d), federal employees participating in the Civil Service Retirement System can retire early via a DSR, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.503, or via an "early out" Voluntary Early Retirement Authority retirement, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.114. While DSR is involuntary and early out retirement is voluntary, both plans make the retiree eligible for an ongoing annuity, and the annuity computation formula is the same under both. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, U.S. Office of Pers. Mgmt., <span class="Italic">Guide to Voluntary Early Retirement Regulations</span> (2006). If a DSR retiree returns to work for the federal government, her annuity ends and she collects a new salary in full; by contrast, a rehired early out retiree becomes a reemployed annuitant who continues to collect her annuity and separately collects a reduced salary, with the amount of the annuity offset from that salary. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344; <span class="Italic">see also Wolthuis v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, No. 94-3596, 1995 WL 19381, at *6 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 19, 1995) (unpublished).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The distinction between full employee and reemployed annuitant status affects an individual's right to appeal an adverse personnel action. While most federal employees subjected to such actions have a right to appeal the agency decision to the MSPB, <span class="Italic">see Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 133 S. Ct. 596, 600 (2012), reemployed voluntary early out retirees do not enjoy an appeal right. Section 3323(b)(1) of title 5 specifies,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding other statutes, an annuitant, as defined by section 8331 or 8401, receiving annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund [e.g., an early out retiree] is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in an appointive position for which the annuitant is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed...serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3323(b)(1) thus makes clear that any retired and later reemployed individual receiving an annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund serves at the will of the agency that has reemployed her.[1] <span class="Italic">See Vesser</span>, 29 F.3d at 604. The consequence of being an at will employee is that the employee has no right of appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 752.401(d)(4), 432.102(f)(11); <span class="Italic">see also Evans v.

<p class="Body-Text">Loss of appeal rights occurs regardless of how the individual achieves reemployed annuitant status, <span class="Italic">Terrill v. MSPB</span>, 610 Fed. Appx. 982, 983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3323(b)(1) provides that an individual receiving an annuity may become reemployed in an appointive position for which he or she is qualified but, when so reemployed, serves "at the will of the appointing authority." This court has held that whether or not a reemployed annuitant falls within &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1) turns on whether the individual continues to receive an annuity upon reemployment. <span class="Italic">See Vesser</span>, 29 F.3d at 604 ("It is clear that in...&#x00A7; 3323(b)(1)...the actual receipt of the annuity is significant with regard to the status of a reemployed individual."). Pursuant to &#x00A7; 9902(g), a discontinued service annuitant under the Civil Service Retirement System who is reemployed with the Department of Defense, as Ms. Terrill was, continues to receive her annuity unless she elects to cease annuity payments within ninety days of being informed of such option.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Terrill does not dispute that she did not exercise her option to cease annuity payments, and instead continued to receive her annuity throughout her reemployment with the Army National Guard. Because she continued receiving her annuity upon reemployment, Ms. Terrill was a reemployed annuitant serving at the will of the appointing authority under &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1), and has no right to appeal her removal. <span class="Italic">See Vesser</span>, 29 F.3d at 604-05; <span class="Italic">Garza</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. at 94 (finding no jurisdiction because the discontinued service annuitant continued receiving annuity upon reemployment, and thus was a reemployed annuitant serving at will under &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1)); <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 165 (1987) (finding no jurisdiction because the reemployed annuitant continued receiving his annuity upon reemployment and was thus serving at will under &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1)); <span class="Italic">Colbert v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 492, 495 (1992) (finding that when a discontinued service annuitant's annuity is terminated upon reemployment, he is not a reemployed annuitant serving at will under &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contesting her status as an at will employee under &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1), Ms. Terrill argues that discontinued service annuitants who are reemployed via the Priority Placement Program should be treated differently than other reemployed annuitants. Her rationale is that placement of a discontinued service annuitant via the Priority Placement Program is more akin to a <span class="Italic">continuation</span> of previous employment than an <span class="Italic">appointment</span> under &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1). But this assertion is unsupported by statute or regulation. Further, it misses the point, as an employee's status as a reemployed annuitant serving at will does not turn on the <span class="Italic">process</span> by which reemployment occurs. Rather, by the plain words of the statute, Ms. Terrill falls within &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1) because she continued "receiving annuity" upon her reemployment. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>, 29 F.3d at 604.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Terrill also argues that the agency improperly revised her employment status. She points out that her original Standard Form 50 ("SF-50") designated her as a permanent employee, and it was not until several years later that the agency revised her SF-50 to designate her as an at will employee. She also argues that, although she was notified of her choice to waive her annuity upon reemployment, and how that choice would affect her salary and compensation, she was not told that her choice could affect her employment status or appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An SF-50 alone does not control an employee's status. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 775-77 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Rather, when there is evidence of error in such a document, it is appropriate to look to the totality of the circumstances to determine the employee's correct status and rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Scott v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, 438 (2010). Here, despite the error on Ms. Terrill's SF-50, there is no dispute that she continued to receive her annuity upon reemployment; thus, she falls within the plain language of &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1). Further, when, as here, an individual is reappointed to new agency, she is responsible for determining the consequences of her change in position. <span class="Italic">See Park v.

<p class="Body-Text">A transfer of a reemployed FERS annuitant does not vest appellate jurisdiction over a termination, and it matters not (jurisdictionally) whether the agency informs the employee of the absence of appeals rights when the reemployed annuitant accepts an appointment, <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. DOD</span>, AT-0752-16-0065-I-1 (NP 9/1/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There is no dispute that he has received an annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) since that time. The appellant was first reemployed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on July 5, 2011. He was subsequently selected for a position at the Defense Contract Audit Administration (DCAA) and was appointed via transfer from DHS effective December 2, 2012. The appellant received an "Unacceptable" performance rating on October 5, 2015. On October 9, 2015, the appellant's appointment was terminated. The appellant appealed the termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1), an annuitant, as defined by section 8331 or 8401 of title 5, can be reemployed. However, a reemployed annuitant receiving an annuity serves at the will of the appointing authority. <span class="Italic">Vesser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 F.3d 600, 604 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Bovay v. Small Business Administration</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). Generally, such an employee has no right to appeal an adverse action to the Board. <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>, 29 F.3d at 604; <span class="Italic">Garza v. Department of the Navy</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 91, &#x00B6; 9 (2012) (finding that the appellant's reemployment after retirement under FERS was as a reemployed annuitant because his annuity continued upon his reemployment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also appears to argue that he is not a reemployed annuitant because he was appointed via a transfer from DHS and was not separated from his first postretirement appointment. A transfer is a change from a position in one agency to a position in another agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(18). A reemployed annuitant is an employee whose annuity continued after reemployment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(13). The appellant's status as a reemployed annuitant was not altered by his transfer from one position to another. The parties do not dispute that the appellant continued to receive his annuity after he was transferred to the DCAA. Therefore, he was a reemployed annuitant when he was terminated from his position at the DCAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency failed to advise him about the consequences of being hired as a reemployed annuitant. However, a new employing agency has no obligation to inform an employee of the effect that an appointment will have on his chapter 75 adverse action rights. <span class="Italic">See Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 535 (1998). Even if the agency had an obligation to inform the appellant that he served at-will, a breach of that obligation would not except the appellant from his at-will status under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1). In other words, the appellant was an at-will employee even if the agency neglected to inform him of that fact. <span class="Italic">See Dunklebarger v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 130 F.3d 1476, 1480 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (finding that the principles of estoppel do not apply to vest the Board with jurisdiction where Congress has not done so).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3323(b) does not create a property right for a reemployed annuitant; it removes a bar to employment. Under <span class="Italic">Walsh</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the appointment and its termination are at the will of the appointing officer. Because a reemployed annuitant has no regulatory or statutory right of appeal, the Board will not entertain an adverse action appeal from separation from employment. A suggestion in <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> that waiver of an annuity removes one from the provisions of 5 USC 3323(b) was overruled by <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 648, 656 (1993), but the Board's determination in <span class="Italic">Vesser</span> was in turn reversed in <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 29 F.3d 600 (Fed. Cir. 1994), resolving that the statutory requirement for at-will employment of a reemployed annuitant is avoided if the appellant offers to waive annuity payments for the period of the appointment [discussed later in this chapter in "<a href="0100-2023-08-434.html#sec1-428">Employment Practice Challenges</a>"] . Additional guidance concerning the meaning of "reemployed annuitant" involving an individual who was subjected to a RIF, then later retired, and ultimately obtained government employment, can be found in <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. DOD</span>, 33 MSPR 165 (1987), <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">remand</span> <span class="Italic">from</span> <span class="Italic">Speigel v. MSPB</span>, 785 F.2d 324 (Fed.

Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-3443-12-0818-I-1 (NP 5/23/2013) ("In his appeal and in his petition for review, the appellant argues that the removal action was unjust.

There is nothing in the record to suggest that the appellant waived his annuity. Because the appellant does not have the right to appeal his removal to the Board, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A collective bargaining agreement does not establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal from the termination of a reemployed annuitant, <span class="Italic">Wencewicz v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, DE-3443-13-1949-I-1 (NP 8/28/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant argues that the CBA accords him a different status, i.e., as a reinstated employee with Board appeal rights, his argument is unavailing. The Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters specifically entrusted to it by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). Here, section 3323(b)(1) expressly provides that reemployed annuitants, like the appellant, do not have Board appeal rights. Further, it is well-settled that an agreement between an agency and its employees cannot serve to confer jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Veterans Administration</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 438, 441 (1989); <span class="Italic">Pogarsky v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 196, 198 (1981). Accordingly, the CBA does not extend Board jurisdiction to the appellant's removal appeal. Insofar as the CBA affords the appellant procedural entitlements to challenge his employment status, compliance with those entitlements can be enforced only through the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See Pogarsky</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. at 198. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the appellant, as a reemployed annuitant, has no right to appeal his termination to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Since a reemployed annuitant had no right to appeal termination, he had no right to appeal an allegedly involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">James v. DHS</span>, CH-0752-13-2717-I-2 (NP 9/26/2014) ("A reemployed annuitant receiving an annuity generally has no right to appeal his separation to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garza v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in her petition for review that the administrative judge failed to "substantively address the evidence," including various notations on her SF-50s, submitted to support her claim that she was hired under the competitive service and was therefore a permanent employee with Board appeal rights. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1), reemployed annuitants serve as at-will employees and lack Board appeal rights over adverse actions. We find unpersuasive the appellant's argument that, despite the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1), she is nonetheless entitled to Board appeal rights because the "Nature of Action" and "Legal Authority" blocks on the SF-50 documenting her reemployment indicate that her employment with the agency was a "Career Reinstatement" under the authority of 5 C.F.R. 315.401. The SF-50 blocks do not overcome the express provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1). As to the appellant's allegation that the SF-50 documenting her appointment did not reflect that she served at the will of the agency, this would not provide an exception to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1) even if the SF-50 contained an error in that regard. In addition, the appellant alleges that the agency had a duty to notify her of her at-will status and its failure to do so confers jurisdiction on the Board to adjudicate her appeal. However, we have previously held that a new employing agency, such as the USDA here, has no obligation to inform the employee of the effect of the appointment has on her chapter 75 adverse action rights. <span class="Italic">See Park v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 535 (1998). Moreover, even if the agency had an obligation to inform the appellant that she served at the will of the agency, a breach of that obligation would not except the appellant from her at-will status under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1). The appellant was an at-will employee even if the agency neglected to inform her of that fact. <span class="Italic">See Dunklebarger v.
