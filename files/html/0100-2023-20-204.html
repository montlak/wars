<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-198"><span class="space">g.</span> Significance of Retaliatory Investigation; Appellant Initiates Investigation; <span class="Italic">Marano</span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem of the retaliatory investigation was the subject of statutory changes brought about by the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, codified to 5 USC 1214 (Investigation of Prohibited Personnel Practices; Corrective Action), as amended:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;Any corrective action ordered under this section to correct a prohibited personnel practice may include fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee, if such investigation was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;The Special Counsel may petition the Board to order corrective action, including fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred by an employee due to an investigation of the employee by an agency, if the investigation by an agency was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for a disclosure or protected activity described in section 2302(b)(8) or subparagraph (A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) of section 2302(b)(9), without regard to whether a personnel action, as defined in section 2302(a)(2)(A), is taken.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3973"></span>5 USC 1221(g) (Individual Right of Action) adds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;Any corrective action ordered under this section to correct a prohibited personnel practice may include fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee, if such investigation was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sistek v. VA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200408126">955 F.3d 948</a>, 954-57 (Fed. Cir. 2020), determined that an retaliatory investigation is not a covered action for purposes of an IRA appeal, with the exception of creation of a hostile environment. The investigation may
 be shown to be a part of the larger picture of reprisal in connection with a covered personnel action. The decisions that follow are not uniform, but some distinguish the investigation from the results of the investigation. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "Other Investigations."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning the substance of an allegation of a retaliatory investigation, and action based on the investigation, appellants may assert that misconduct charged against them is the result of an investigation designed to punish them for whistleblowing. A decision postdating, but involving facts predating, the 2012 WPEA, <span class="Italic">Shibuya v. USDA</span>, 119 MSPR 537, 549-50 &#x00B6; 24, 2013 MSPB 44 (2013), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[12]&#x2003;The administrative judge found that the personnel actions at issue in this appeal, i.e., significantly changing the appellant's duties, relocating the appellant's office, investigating the appellant, and demoting the appellant, are covered personnel actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). However, an investigation is not generally a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). Nevertheless, the Board has held that it is proper to consider evidence regarding an investigation if it is so closely related to a personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering information to retaliate for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Mattil v. Department of State</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 21 (2012). Here, the results of the investigation of the appellant for alleged misconduct concerning his advice to destroy emails that he believed were potentially discoverable in future litigation formed the basis for the demotion action, which is a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). Thus, we have considered evidence regarding the agency's investigation into the appellant's alleged misconduct in analyzing whether the agency demoted the appellant in reprisal for his whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found regarding the timing of the action, the record reflects that in November 2008, the appellant told an agency manager about his disclosure to OSC regarding the CFO's misconduct. Soon thereafter, the manager initiated an investigation into the appellant's alleged misconduct. Based on the results of the agency investigation, the agency proposed to demote the appellant in December 2009. The deciding official for the demotion learned of the appellant's disclosure to OSC by February 2010, and the demotion was effected in June 2010. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant proved by way of the knowledge-timing test that his protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to demote him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Doyle v. VA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210514272">855 Fed. Appx. 753</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), considered a retaliatory investigation coupled with a reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Doyle argues that the Board's conclusion that the AIB investigation does not qualify as an adverse personnel action is contrary to law. This court has held that an investigation of an employee, without more, is not a qualifying personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Sistek v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 955 F.3d 948, 955 (Fed. Cir. 2020). But "a retaliatory investigation, either on its own or as part of a broader set of circumstances, may qualify as a personnel action if it rises to the level" of a "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, there is no dispute that Ms. Doyle had several significant changes in job duties and responsibilities as well as working conditions. During the course of the AIB investigation, Ms. Doyle was reassigned from her job as a DA to the mailroom, and then to the library. She was reassigned a third time as a direct result of a recommendation made by the AIB in its investigation report. As such, the AIB investigation was the direct cause for at least one change in Ms. Doyle's change in duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing circumstances, we conclude that the AIB investigation was a retaliatory investigation closely related to at least one reassignment. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-24 (M.S.P.B. 1997) ("The Board will consider evidence regarding the conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity."). We therefore hold that the Board's legal conclusion that the AIB investigation was not a qualifying personnel action was contrary to law. Consequently, the burden shifts to the agency to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Kewley,</span> 153 F.3d at 1363.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit went to some trouble in <span class="Italic">Marano v. DOJ</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1140-43 (Fed. Cir. 1993), to explain that reprisal may infect personnel actions indirectly connected to protected disclosures, and that the motivation of agency officials is not an essential ingredient of proof of the relation between whistleblowing and a resulting tainted personnel action challenged through an IRA appeal. Marano disclosed mismanagement; the agency investigated and determined that the allegations were substantiated. The managers against whom the allegations were made were reassigned, but so was the appellant. The appellant argued that he was punished for his disclosures. The AJ determined that it was "the situation that existed in the Albany office, not the <span class="Italic">disclosures</span> of information that he made[,]" that led to the reassignment decision. Reversing and remanding the case, the court explained why the AJ's analysis was faulty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before enactment of the WPA, Congress defined a prohibited personnel practice as "tak[ing] or fail[ing] to take a personnel action...<span class="Italic">as a reprisal for</span>" a protected disclosure of information. Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 101(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 1114 (CSRA), 5 USC 2302(b)(8) (1988). The courts interpreted this language as requiring the whistleblower to carry a considerable burden of proof in order to establish his case. The whistleblower was required to establish, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the disclosure constituted a "significant" or "motivating" factor in the agency's decision to take the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466, 1469-70 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress later recognized this "excessively heavy burden imposed on the employee" in effect had gutted the CSRA's protection of whistleblowers. 135 Cong. Rec. 5033 (1989) (Explanatory Statement on S. 20, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> 135 Cong. Rec. 564 (1989) (remarks of Sen. Levin) (surveys reveal the dismal effectiveness of CSRA's encouragement and protection of whistleblowers). Thus, in 1989 Congress amended the CSRA's statutory scheme with the WPA, thereby substantially reducing a whistleblower's burden to establish his case, and "send[ing] a strong, clear signal to whistleblowers that Congress intends that they be protected from any retaliation related to their whistleblowing." 135 Cong. Rec. 5033 (1989) (Explanatory Statement on S. 20). Rather than being required to prove that the whistleblowing disclosure was a "significant" or "motivating" factor, the whistleblower under the WPA, 5 USC 1221(e)(1), must evidence only that his protected disclosure played a role in, or was "a contributing factor" to, the personnel action taken:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The words "a contributing factor"...mean <span class="Italic">any factor which, alone or in connection with other factors, tends to affect in any way the outcome of the decision</span>. This test is specifically intended to overrule existing case law, which requires a whistleblower to prove that his protected conduct was a "significant," "motivating," "substantial," or "predominant" factor in a personnel action in order to overturn that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">135 Cong. Rec. 5033 (1989) (Explanatory Statement on S. 20); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 135 Cong. Rec. 5032, 5033 (Explanatory Statement on S. 20 should be read in conjunction with the exhaustive legislative history of S. 508, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. (1988)); 135 Cong. Rec. 4513 (1989) (Joint Explanatory Statement on S. 508); 5 USC 1214(b)(4)(B)(i) &#x0026; 1221(e)(1). This substantial reduction of the whistleblower's burden evidences that a personnel action, taken "because of" a protected disclosure, or "as a result of" a prohibited personnel practice, and therefore encompassed by sections 2302(b)(8) and 1221(a), may be taken "because of" or "as a result of" many different factors, only one of which must be a protected disclosure and <span class="Italic">a</span> contributing factor to the personnel action in order for the WPA's protection to take effect. Indeed, the legislative history of the WPA emphasizes that "any" weight given to the protected disclosure, either alone or even in combination with other factors, can satisfy the "contributing factor" test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is thus evident in light of the WPA's modifications to the CSRA that though evidence of a retaliatory motive would still suffice to establish a violation of his rights under the WPA, <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 981 F.2d 1237, 1238 (Fed. Cir. 1992), a whistleblower <span class="Italic">need not</span> demonstrate the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employee taking the alleged prohibited personnel action in order to establish that his disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action: "Regardless of the official's motives, personnel actions against employees should quite [simply] not be based on protected activities such as whistleblowing." S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1988) (accompanying S. 508).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once a whistleblower has established the existence of a prohibited personnel practice by a preponderance of evidence, the burden then shifts to the agency to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action against the whistleblower even in the absence of his protected disclosure. 5 USC 1214(b)(4)(B)(ii) &#x0026; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, at 1469-70; 135 Cong. Rec. 5033 (1989) (Explanatory Statement on S. 20). If the agency cannot carry its burden on this affirmative defense, the Board "shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate." 5 USC 1221(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3974"></span>The only issue to be resolved in this case is whether Marano's protected disclosure was a contributing factor to his reassignment to the New York City Office. Resolution of this issue invites us to investigate both the WPA's statutory scheme and Congress' intent behind its enactment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In attempting to persuade this court of the Board's error, Marano argues that because the fact of his signing, as well as the content of, his disclosure triggered the investigation in Albany, and because the information discovered as a result of the investigation prompted DEA to reassign the supervisors and Marano, the disclosure <span class="Italic">a fortiori</span> was a "contributing" factor to the personnel action. Thus, Marano argues that because the reassignment decision was "inextricably linked" to his disclosure, he is protected by the WPA from the adverse action, unless the agency can prove its affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to Marano's position, the government argues that Marano's status as a whistleblower played no role in the decision to reassign him. Rather, the action was taken as a result of the situation existing in the Albany Office that was confirmed by the independent investigation. According to the government, the Board can only provide corrective action where an employee's <span class="Italic">status</span> as a whistleblower is a contributing factor in the personnel action taken. Therefore, presumably, the WPA should not apply to Marano because his whistleblowing was not the immediate cause-in-fact of his reassignment, and therefore DEA's action was warranted and is sustainable under the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has not previously decided whether the distinction between the fact of disclosure (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the whistleblower's status as a whistleblower), and the content of the disclosure made by the whistleblower, may affect the decision as to whether a particular disclosure is a "contributing factor" to a personnel action. In this case, if the WPA is concerned only with the fact of disclosure, and not with the content thereof, we must affirm the Board's decision because substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that Marano's whistleblower status, and the bare fact that he blew the whistle, was not considered by the DEA official in making the reassignment decision. Substantial evidence, however, also supports the AJ's finding that the situation in the Albany Office exposed by Marano's disclosure resulted in his reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The policy goal behind the WPA was to encourage government personnel to blow the whistle on wasteful, corrupt or illegal government practices without fearing retaliatory action by their supervisors or those harmed by the disclosures. WPA &#x00A7; 2, 103 Stat. 16, 5 USC 1201 note. Such encouragement is guaranteed by the substantially reduced burden that must be carried by the whistleblower to earn the WPA's protection from adverse action. So long as a protected disclosure is <span class="Italic">a</span> contributing factor to the contested personnel action, and the agency cannot prove its affirmative defense, no harm can come to the whistleblower. We thus view the WPA as a good-government statute. As long as employees fear being subjected to adverse actions for having disclosed improper governmental practices, an obvious disincentive exists to discourage such disclosures. A principal office of the WPA is to eliminate that disincentive and freely encourage employees to disclose that which is wrong with our government. How a protected disclosure is made, or by whom, matters not to the achievement of the WPA's goal. The elements of misgovernment must be disclosed before they can be cured in satisfaction of the WPA's <span class="Italic">raison d'etre</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A typical case under the WPA involves an employee blowing the whistle on certain practices observed in the workplace, such as misuse of government funds or grossly wasteful practices. Since rectifying such conduct would not normally involve taking a personnel action against the whistleblower, any proximate personnel action taken against the employee would immediately demand attention as a potential violation of the employee's rights under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 135 Cong. Rec. 5035 (1989) (reprint of Joint Explanatory Statement on S. 508) ("One of many possible ways to show that the whistleblowing was a [contributing] factor in the personnel action is to show that the official taking the action knew (or had constructive knowledge) of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action."); 134 Cong. Rec. 27,854 (1988) (Joint Explanatory Statement on S. 508); S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1988) (accompanying S. 508); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, at 1471-72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA, however, also applies to the situation where a government employee discloses information that is closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities, such that structuring a remedy to the situation revealed in the disclosure could foreseeably affect the whistleblower. In the situation where the information disclosed is closely related to the whistleblower's duties, as evidenced by the facts of the present case, a tension exists between the WPA's protection of the individual and the government's need to act on the basis of the information revealed to remedy the disclosed wrongdoing. This tension is most troublesome when the government's corrective action would ensnare the whistleblower allegedly for reasons independent of the simple fact that the employee was the initial source of the information. In some of such cases, reasoning that the personnel action was grounded on bases "independent" of the actual protected disclosure could easily be used as a ruse to eviscerate the WPA's protection. In all such cases, the whistleblower who has done no wrong would have no incentive to improve government by making a protected disclosure. Indeed, if the whistleblowing employee who has done no wrong can be disciplined for having disclosed misgovernment of which he is not part, the employee surely will have no incentive to reveal his knowledge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in order to prevent subversion of the WPA's policy goals, the latter type of whistleblower only needs to carry the same burden before the Board as the more "typical" whistleblower. That is, the employee only needs to demonstrate by preponderant evidence that the fact of, or the content of, the protected disclosure was one of the factors that tended to affect in any way the personnel action. Upon such showing, the agency must bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the personnel action would have been taken in the absence of the protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, though the ADA testified that the decision to reassign Marano was based solely on the results of the investigation and not on the bare fact that Marano <span class="Italic">made</span> a disclosure, all the testimony before the AJ proves that the initial memorandum was inextricably intertwined with the investigation. The investigation was prompted as the direct result of the protected disclosure, and served, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to verify the content of the protected disclosure. Consequently, there is more than sufficient evidence in the record to support the AJ's finding that Marano was reassigned because of the management situation in the Albany Office. In this case, then, the uncontested sequence of events demonstrates that the initial, protected disclosure, "in connection with" the investigative report, satisfies the "contributing factor" requirement of the statute. The content of Marano's disclosure gave the agency the reason for its personnel action. Consequently, the contributing factor in this case appears to be the same as the agency's reason for taking the personnel action. The facts uniformly prove that the content of Marano's disclosure was a contributing factor to his reassignment. The AJ thus erred as a matter of law, not of fact, in deciding that only the fact of disclosure, or in other words, the whistleblower's status as a whistleblower, could be a contributing factor under the statute, and in holding that Marano had not met his burden of proof under the WPA. Since "[w]histleblowing should never be a factor that contributes in any way to an adverse personnel action," 135 Cong. Rec. 5033 (1989) (Explanatory Statement on S. 20), the burden must shift to DEA to demonstrate that the same personnel action would have been taken had the agency not learned of the situation in the Albany Office from Marano. Upon remand, the government will have the opportunity to establish its affirmative defense by clear and convincing evidence. If the government cannot sustain its burden on that issue, the Board will then have occasion to fashion such corrective action as it considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Marano</span> does not require the whistleblower to demonstrate the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employee taking the alleged prohibited personnel action in order to establish that his disclosure was a contributing factor, the presence or absence of a retaliatory motivation may be considered by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Traynor v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 386, 393 (1994). A supervisor's knowledge of the appellant's contact with the IG, or the supervisor's knowledge of the content of those disclosures, suffices to make a nonfrivolous allegation of a contributing factor for IRA jurisdictional analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perkins v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 250, 259 &#x00B6; 20 (2005); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gilmore v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marano</span> was applied to an analogous situation of discipline against an individual who, in the course of her investigatory work, disclosed wrongdoing that led to more investigative activity that returned to haunt her, <span class="Italic">Connelly v. NRC</span>, 64 MSPR 28, 33-36 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the very fact that she conducted an investigation into the Fortuna matter and then was reprimanded for her conduct of the Fortuna investigation, in itself, automatically constituted a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that her protected activity was a contributing factor to the personnel action. In support of this argument, she cited <span class="Italic">Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1993), in which the court found that, although an agency's decision to reassign a whistleblower was not based on the bare fact that he made a protected disclosure, that disclosure was a "contributing factor" since the reassignment decision was based on the content of his disclosure. The administrative judge rejected this argument. He distinguished the instant case from <span class="Italic">Marano</span> by noting that, while the personnel action in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> was based directly upon the agency's investigation of Marano's claims of misconduct by supervisory personnel, the personnel action herein was based upon "the quality, or alleged lack thereof," of the appellant's investigations of alleged wrongdoing by Fortuna and by Kelly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3975"></span>In her petition for review, the appellant stresses the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> that an employee claiming the protection of the WPA need not demonstrate a retaliatory motive by the agency in order to succeed. <span class="Italic">See Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1141-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that statements in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> regarding just this kind of case--i.e., "the situation where the information disclosed is closely related to the whistleblower's duties," <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142--provide strong support for the proposition that a disclosure made in the performance of an employee's duties can be a contributing factor even if the action at issue ultimately is shown to have been based on valid considerations not related to the content of the protected disclosures. In addressing this kind of situation, the court expressed its concern about cases in which "the government's corrective action would ensnare the whistleblower allegedly for reasons independent of the simple fact that the employee was the initial source of the information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court then made the following observations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In some of such cases, reasoning that the personnel action was grounded on bases "independent" of the actual protected disclosure could easily be used as a ruse to eviscerate the WPA's protection. In all such cases, the whistleblower who has done no wrong would have no incentive to improve government by making a protected disclosure. Indeed, if the whistleblowing employee who has done no wrong can be disciplined for having disclosed misgovernment of which he is not part, the employee surely will have no incentive to reveal his knowledge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, in order to prevent subversion of the WPA's policy goals, the latter type of whistleblower only needs to carry the same burden before the Board as the more "typical" whistleblower. That is, the employee only needs to demonstrate by preponderant evidence that the fact of, or the content of, the protected disclosure was one of the factors that tended to affect in any way the personnel action. Upon such showing, the agency must bear the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the personnel action would have been taken in the absence of the protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1142-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case are very similar to those of <span class="Italic">Marano</span>. In <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, the employee reported that two management officials in his office had engaged in certain alleged misconduct and mismanagement; his disclosures led to an investigation that indicated serious management problems in the office; and the agency subsequently reassigned him based on the investigator's recommendation that the problem be resolved by assigning both him and the officials named in his disclosure to positions outside the office. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1138. In the present case, the appellant's disclosures regarding Fortuna--i.e., that he had possibly formed a relationship with, and was impermissibly divulging information to, an anti-nuclear activist--were, in part, the basis for her investigation; and her conduct of the investigation was the basis for her reprimand. Just as Marano's complaint about the quality of management was a contributing factor in his reassignment because it led to the discovery that he was part of the problem, the appellant's disclosure regarding Fortuna--which led to the discovery that the appellant was part of the problem because her investigatory skills were faulty--was a contributing factor in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that <span class="Italic">Marano</span> is distinguishable from the instant appeal because the appellant herein was disciplined neither for the <span class="Italic">fact</span> nor for the <span class="Italic">content</span> of her disclosures regarding Fortuna, but rather, for the "valid management concerns" set forth in the letter of reprimand concerning the <span class="Italic">quality</span> of her investigations into the Fortuna and Kelly matters. These arguments are inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, however, inasmuch as they suggest that more proof is needed to meet the "contributing factor" test when the protected disclosures were made as part of the employee's job. The statements in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> quoted above, i.e., that an employee who makes protected disclosures in the performance of his duties carries the same burden as the more "typical" whistleblower, and that the matters of how and by whom the disclosure is made are not germane to the achievement of the WPA's goals, indicate that <span class="Italic">Marano</span> holdings regarding the proof needed to meet the "contributing factor" test apply with equal force to employees whose jobs require them to make disclosures of the sort protected by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Furthermore, the validity of the agency's concerns and the agency's alleged reliance on the quality of the appellant's investigation, rather than on the fact that she was the employee who led the investigation, do not establish that the appellant's disclosures were not a contributing factor in her letter of reprimand. Rather, these factors are relevant to whether the agency proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Marano</span> court also noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Despite evidence that] the decision to reassign Marano was based solely on the results of the investigation and not on the bare fact that Marano <span class="Italic">made</span> a disclosure, all the testimony before the administrative judge proves that the initial memorandum was inextricably intertwined with the investigation [because the] investigation was prompted as the direct result of the protected disclosure, and served, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to verify the content of the protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1143. Here, as in <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, the appellant's disclosure was "inextricably intertwined with the investigation" that led to her reprimand. While it could be argued that it was the <span class="Italic">fact</span> of the protected disclosure that led to the appellant's reprimand while it was the <span class="Italic">content</span> of Marano's disclosure that led to his reassignment, the effect, under <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, is the same. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if the appellant's protected disclosure was not in the investigative report itself, but rather, consisted of a matter that gave rise to the investigative report, that distinction is insignificant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The causal relationship between Marano's disclosure and his reassignment was likewise not direct; instead, his disclosure led to an investigation that led to the discovery that led to his reassignment. The appellant's disclosure is just as "inextricably intertwined with the investigation" that led to the action at issue as Marano's disclosure was intertwined with the action at issue in that case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency's arguments that adopting the appellant's interpretation of <span class="Italic">Marano</span> would provide "unprecedented immunity from management action" to employees who report on matters such as mismanagement, and that it would "t[ie] management's hands in...a nonsensical manner," not only are inconsistent with the statements in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> that are quoted or described above, but also ignore the "clear and convincing evidence" test of the WPA. The fact that an employee can meet the contributing factor test fairly easily does not mean that he or she is immune from discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have noted, the administrative judge did not determine whether the agency demonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action absent the appellant's protected disclosure. The decision of this issue depends upon the resolution of disputed factual matters, such as the quality of the appellant's work and the validity and motivation of the criticisms of that work. <span class="Italic">See Grant v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 370, 375-77, 378 (1994). Therefore, the administrative judge, who conducted a hearing in which these matters were addressed, should make the initial findings and conclusions as to this issue....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the remand, another PFR was adjudicated in <span class="Italic">Connelly v. NRC</span>, 67 MSPR 93 (1995) (Table). There followed an appeal to the Federal Circuit, but the court affirmed the Board, <span class="Italic">Connelly v. NRC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3432):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the NRC reprimanded Ms. Connelly for "poor judgment...exercised as the Director of the former [OIA] during the OIA investigation of Roger Fortuna and the OIA investigation of James Kelly." The Board found that Ms. Connelly made a protected disclosure regarding the Fortuna investigation, and that said disclosure was a "contributing factor" in the agency's decision to reprimand her. Because this disclosure was a "contributing factor" to the letter of reprimand, Ms. Connelly is protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is substantial evidence to support this view, and we will not upset that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2), Ms. Connelly is not entitled to relief if the NRC demonstrates to the Board, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have issued the letter of reprimand absent the protected disclosure. The Board noted that in determining whether the agency would have reprimanded appellant absent her protected disclosure, one could simply remove the letter's references to the Fortuna investigation, and rely on the letter's other reasons for disciplining Ms. Connelly. Accordingly, the Board did so, and found, by clear and convincing evidence, that poor quality work with regard to the Kelly investigation was sufficient to support the reprimand. The evidence cited by the Board includes findings by two investigators, and the letter of reprimand itself. Because the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence, and is neither arbitrary nor capricious, the Board's decision to deny Ms. Connelly corrective action is <span class="Italic">AFFIRMED</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994, Congress amended the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) to establish a "<span class="Italic">per se</span>" knowledge/timing test that allows an employee to demonstrate that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action against the employee knew of the disclosure and took the personnel action within a period of time <span id="Page_3976"></span>such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. 5 USC 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 238 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">Powers v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 150, 155 (1995).... The deciding official, Regional Director Kane, had actual knowledge of the appellant's whistleblowing activity and the decision to demote was made approximately 7 months after the disclosure. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has shown by preponderant evidence that his disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's demotion action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the unique circumstances of this case, however, even if the deciding official did not have actual knowledge of the disclosure, we would find that imputed knowledge impermissibly influenced his decision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Marchese v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 104, 108-09 (1994) (an appellant may establish constructive knowledge by demonstrating that an individual with actual knowledge of the disclosure influenced the official accused of taking a retaliatory action). A whistleblower need not demonstrate the existence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employee taking the alleged prohibited action in order to establish that his disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1141 (Fed. Cir. 1993). "Regardless of the official's motives, personnel actions against employees should quite [simply] not be based on protected activities such as whistleblowing." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (quoting S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1988)). As discussed below, but for the allegations made by the subjects of the protected disclosure, Regional Director Kane would not have been presented with the incidents in question. Thus, we find that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. When such a showing is made, the Board will order corrective action unless the agency can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action absent the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Page</span> <span class="Italic">v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 59 MSPR 452, 455 (1993), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, No. 94-3118, 1994 WL 745586 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 13, 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will consider evidence regarding the conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity<span class="Italic">. See Geyer v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 70 MSPR 682, 688, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 96-3328, 1997 WL 334944 (Fed. Cir. June 18, 1997) (Table); <span class="Italic">Mongird v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 504, 507 (1987). In considering such evidence, the Board looks at where the investigation had its beginnings. <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 689.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The three charges in the instant case were based on six specifications. Five of the six specifications arose from the findings of certain investigations by the agency's Office of Internal Affairs (OIA). The OIA investigations were initiated because of allegations about the appellant made by one of the two subjects of the protected disclosure, Warden Wooten. On January 13, 1994, three (3) months after the appellant's disclosure, Warden Wooten reported to the agency's OIA that the appellant: used annual leave without approval; failed to report an assault of an inmate by a staff member; established inappropriate relationships with inmates; placed phone calls for an inmate; promised inmates transfers and early releases; held himself out as acting captain; and made unprofessional comments and gestures to female staff. Three of those allegations, that the appellant failed to report an assault of an inmate, placed phone calls for inmates, and made unprofessional comments and gestures to female staff, formed the bases of the agency's charges. In the addition, during OIA's investigation of the Warden's allegations, the appellant averred that he gave a pen to an inmate and that he made derogatory comments about staff in front of inmates. These averments were relied on to support two of the agency's charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an investigation is so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate, and the agency does not show by clear and convincing evidence that the evidence would have been gathered absent the protected disclosure, then the appellant will prevail on his affirmative defense of retaliation for whistleblowing. That the investigation itself is conducted in a fair and impartial manner, or that certain acts of misconduct are discovered during the investigation, does not relieve an agency of its obligation to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1221(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To here hold otherwise would sanction the use of a purely retaliatory tool, selective investigations. Congress included protection for whistleblowers in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), to assure federal employees that "they will not suffer if they help uncover and correct administrative abuses." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 8 (1978), reprinted in 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730. Eleven years later Congress strengthened protection for whistleblowers in enacting the WPA, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989), one goal of which was "to encourage government personnel to blow the whistle on wasteful, corrupt, or illegal government practices without fearing retaliatory action by their supervisors or those harmed by the disclosures." <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142 (citing WPA &#x00A7; 2, 103 Stat. 16, 5 USC 1201 note). "So long as a protected disclosure is a contributing factor to a contested personnel action, and the agency cannot prove its affirmative defense, no <span class="Italic">harm</span> can come to the whistleblower." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Thus, an agency's selective use of investigations, i.e., its choice to investigate a whistleblower, because of his or her status as a whistleblower, would contravene this goal. Since the investigations in the present case gave rise to five of the six specifications and all of the charges underlying the demotion action, the OIA investigations were so closely related to the adverse action, we will therefore consider the appellant's claim of "retaliation by investigation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the appellant's claim of "retaliation by investigation," we recognize that the WPA is not intended to shield employees who engage in wrongful conduct merely because they have, at some point, "blown the whistle." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142 n.5. The appellant's situation, however, is more akin to cases where the Board sustains a charge, finds discrimination, and reverses the adverse personnel action because of the taint of discrimination. The taint in such cases is not "cleansed" by arguing that the employee cannot be shielded from his misconduct by anti-discrimination laws<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 610 (1994) (although the Board found that the employee was, as charged, absent without leave, it ordered the agency to cancel the removal because it was tainted by race discrimination, and the agency had failed to show by preponderant evidence that it would have taken the same action absent consideration of a discriminatory motive). An employee is not completely shielded from his misconduct by anti-discrimination laws or the WPA. Rather, those laws shield an employee only to the extent the record supports a finding that he would not have been disciplined except for his status as a whistleblower or a member of a protected class. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the agency showed, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing, the Board considers the following factors: The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 688.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When examining the strength of the agency's evidence, the Board will look at "the evidence that the agency had before it" when it took the alleged retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">See Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 694. The record evidence shows that at the time Warden Wooten made his allegations to OIA that the appellant failed to report that a staff member assaulted an inmate, placed phone calls for an inmate housed in administrative detention, and made unprofessional remarks and gestures to female staff, the Warden had strong evidence of the conduct on which the charges were based. The sixth specification, the use of inappropriate language in an official document, arose from an allegation by DHA Campbell, the second subject of the protected disclosure.... Thus, at the time he reported the appellant's alleged "unprofessional conduct toward an inmate" to Regional Director Kane, Mr. Campbell had clear evidence to support his accusation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence shows that Warden Wooten and Mr. Campbell both had a strong motive to retaliate. They were both subjects of the appellant's protected disclosure, they were the subjects of an OIA investigation due to the appellant's protected disclosure, and both knew about the appellant's protected disclosure when they made their reports about the incidents that formed the basis of the charged misconduct. The agency did not call Warden Wooten as a witness and while it called Mr. Campbell, it did not question him concerning his reasons for sending the memorandum to Regional Director Kane concerning the appellant's conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence shows that the appellant began working as a DHO in May 1993. The appellant worked at two separate institutions as a DHO, FCI-Florence, where Mr. Wooten was the warden, and FCI-Englewood. During the hearing, Mr. Campbell testified that he received no reports from FCI-Englewood about misconduct by the appellant nor did he receive any reports about the appellant from FCI-Florence until after the appellant made his protected disclosure. Further, within 3 months of making his protected disclosure, the appellant was the subject of three separate OIA investigations based on allegations made by Warden Wooten and Mr. Campbell. As shown by the record evidence, the appellant made his protected disclosure on October 10, 1993, and investigations were initiated on October 18, 1993; January 6, 1994; and January 13, 1994. Absent any evidence to the contrary, we find that the circumstantial evidence concerning Warden Wooten and Mr. Campbell's actions after the protected disclosure was made was sufficient to show that they both had a strong motive to retaliate against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3977"></span>As to the last factor, the agency's treatment of similarly situated non-whistleblower employees, we find that the agency submitted no evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence, showing that the kinds of matters reported to OIA in this case were the kinds of matters reported in the cases of similarly situated employees who were not whistleblowers. While the record evidence shows that the agency's policy required management to report violations or apparent violations of its standards of conduct, there is no record evidence showing whether that policy was uniformly and evenhandedly adhered to by the officials who made the reports at issue here. Regional Director Kane's testimony that anyone could raise allegations of misconduct, and that all such allegations were referred to OIA, sheds no light on whether Warden Wooten or Mr. Campbell reported misconduct by similarly situated non-whistleblower employees. The agency had an opportunity to call Warden Wooten to testify about his treatment of similarly situated employees, but it did not take advantage of this opportunity. Further, the agency elicited no testimony on this issue from Mr. Campbell.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Weighing the three factors (strength of the agency's evidence, motive to retaliate, and treatment of similarly-situated non-whistleblowers), we find that although the reporting officials had strong evidence to support their reports concerning the appellant, this factor is far outweighed by their strong motive to retaliate and the lack of any evidence showing that they treated non-whistleblower employees the same way they treated the appellant. Accordingly, we conclude that corrective action is warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this determination we recognize that the agency has a policy requiring employees to report misconduct immediately, and that the agency needs to know as soon as possible about conduct that can jeopardize security or endanger the lives of prison staff or inmates. The WPA, however, requires, even under the circumstances presented here, that the agency show by clear and convincing evidence that it did not treat the appellant differently from similarly situated nonwhistleblowers under that policy. This is particularly important where, as here, the record evidence shows that the reporting officials had a strong motive to retaliate and may have used the reporting policy as a means of furthering a retaliatory end. Moreover, the question of whether the OIA investigations were conducted in a fair and impartial manner is irrelevant. Rather, the question under the WPA is whether Warden Wooten and Mr. Campbell made their reports as a pretext for retaliation. Given the agency's complete failure to meet its burden of proof under the WPA, we have no choice but to order corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ,</span> 104 MSPR 624, 631 &#x00B6; 7, 2007 MSPB 42 (2007), noted that "An investigation is not a personnel action, but the Board will consider evidence of the conduct of an agency investigation when it is so closely related to a personnel action that it could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gibbs v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marano</span> and <span class="Italic">Russell</span> were explained in <span class="Italic">Carr v. SSA</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1322-27 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Carr</span>, 78 MSPR 313 (1998), involving dismissal of an ALJ for charges that included abusive treatment of office staff. A principal defense was that the complaints about Carr were initiated by employees and other judges who were targeted in Carr's complaints about mismanagement and violations of laws, rules, and regulations within the office. Relying on <span class="Italic">Marano</span> and <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, Carr maintained that she could not be removed for misconduct because the allegations of that misconduct originated from the individuals who were distressed about her protected complaints. The court disagreed. The issue was not the origin of the complaints but whether the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action against Carr without her protected disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the pertinent facts, the decision to petition the Board for authority to remove Ms. Carr was made by SSA Associate Commissioner Daniel Skoler. Associate Commissioner Skoler petitioned the Board on behalf of SSA after receiving recommendations to remove Ms. Carr from Judge David Allard, Regional Chief ALJ, and Judge Robert A. Pulcini, Hearing Office Chief ALJ for the New Haven office and Ms. Carr's supervisor. Judge Pulcini received complaints from employees of the New Haven office regarding Ms. Carr, and relayed those complaints to Judge Allard and Associate Commissioner Skoler.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Judge Pulcini and the employees of the New Haven Office had motives to retaliate against Ms. Carr. Judge Pulcini, as Hearing Office Chief ALJ, had responsibility for management of the New Haven office. Ms. Carr's protected disclosures related to the management of the office, and constituted criticisms of Judge Pulcini's performance. Indeed, Judge Pulcini eventually was removed from the position of Hearing Office Chief ALJ. Judge Pulcini plainly had a motive to retaliate against Ms. Carr. The employees of the New Haven office also were motivated to retaliate against Ms. Carr, as Ms. Carr's complaints in part related to their conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that SSA had established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have petitioned for authority to remove Ms. Carr even in the absence of her protected disclosures. The Board determined that "[Judge] Pulcini's influence over the decisionmaker, [Associate Commissioner] Skoler, was limited and thus...the motive to retaliate...did not weigh heavily in favor of finding reprisal." <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 78 MSPR at 336. First, in his recommended decision, which the Board adopted, the CALJ found that Ms. Carr's protected disclosures did not appear to relate to any wrongdoing on Associate Commissioner Skoler's part, and that therefore there was no indication that Associate Commissioner Skoler had any motive to retaliate against Ms. Carr. The CALJ also found that Judge Allard was not the subject of Ms. Carr's allegations of wrongdoing. Lastly, he pointed to various other indications that Judge Pulcini's influence on the removal decision was limited[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, when determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, it will consider the following factors: the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Geyer v. Department of Justice</span>, 70 MSPR 682, 688, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 116 F.3d 1497 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). We believe that <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> sets forth an appropriate test for determining whether, in a given case, an agency has carried its burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action at issue in the absence of the disciplined employee's protected disclosure(s).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except for the one point discussed in Part I above, Ms. Carr does not contest the overwhelming strength of the evidence that SSA presented in support of its petition for authority to remove her from her position. Instead, she directs our attention to the second and third parts of the <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> test. She focuses first on the question of the strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision to remove her. In that regard, she does not challenge the Board's finding that Associate Commissioner Skoler and Judge Allard were not influenced by improper motives on the part of Judge Pulcini. Rather, she argues that the Board failed to consider the extent to which Judge Skoler and Judge Allard were influenced by the complaints made against her in the New Haven hearing office by individuals who had been the subject of her whistleblowing disclosures concerning alleged time and attendance abuses, gross mismanagement, and poor job performance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Ms. Carr argues that the Board should have denied SSA's petition for authority to remove her because the indisputably improper conduct in which she engaged--and for which SSA sought her removal--would not have come to the attention of Associate Commissioner Skoler and Judge Allard but for her protected disclosures. In other words, Ms. Carr asserts that the staff of the New Haven office would not have complained about her behavior and SSA would not have sought to remove her if she had not disclosed the staff's misconduct. For the following reasons, we reject this argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Carr's reliance on <span class="Italic">Marano</span> is misplaced. Marano was employed as a criminal investigator in the Albany, New York office of the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"). <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1138 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Marano submitted a memorandum to the incoming manager of the DEA's New York Field Division alleging misconduct on the part of the Albany office's supervisory agents. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The memorandum, which was indisputably a protected disclosure, prompted an investigation which lead to a "major overhaul" of the Albany office. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1138-39. As part of the overhaul, Marano was transferred to DEA's New York City office. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Marano's transfer did not result from <span id="Page_3978"></span>any wrongdoing on his part. Rather, the Acting Deputy Administrator of DEA determined that "correction of the situation in Albany would require reassigning Marano in order to affect a 'clean sweep' of office leadership and avoid any potential obstacles for the incoming supervisor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1139.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Marano contended that his reassignment amounted to a prohibited personnel action taken in retaliation for his protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. He brought an individual right of action with the Board after the Office of Special Counsel denied his request for corrective action. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The Board denied the appeal. It held that Marano had failed to establish that his disclosure was a contributing factor to his subsequent personnel action because the transfer was due to the investigation that resulted from his whistleblowing disclosure, and not due to the fact that he made the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1139. On appeal this court reversed, stating that Marano's disclosure was intertwined with the subsequent investigation and that therefore the content of the disclosure was a contributing factor to Marano's reassignment. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1143. We remanded the case to the Board to allow the agency to attempt to establish that the Albany to New York City transfer would have taken place in the absence of Marano's disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Marano</span> differs from the present case. The issue in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> was whether Marano's protected disclosure was a contributing factor in his transfer, not whether the agency had met its burden of showing that the transfer would have taken place in the absence of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1141. Ms. Carr confuses the issue of whether her protected disclosures were a contributory factor in the action to remove her--a point that is undisputed--with the issue of whether SSA established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have sought to remove her in the absence of those disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Russell</span> is more like this case. There, an employee of the Department of Justice's ("DOJ's") Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") in Florence, Colorado, was demoted from the position of disciplinary hearing officer to the position of warranty coordinator. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 MSPR 317, 320-21 (1997). Prior to the demotion, Russell submitted a memorandum to BOP's Regional Director asserting that Tom L. Wooten, warden of the Florence facility, and Darwin L. Campbell Jr., the Regional Discipline Hearing Administrator, had improperly interfered with his adjudication of inmate misconduct. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 321. Following this protected disclosure, Russell was the subject of investigations by DOJ's Office of Internal Affairs ("OIA"), based on allegations by Warden Wooten. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 327. The charges which formed the bases for the demotion action resulted from OIA's investigations and from certain additional allegations made by Regional Discipline Hearing Administrator Campbell. As an affirmative defense to the demotion action, Russell contended that but for the allegations made by the subjects of his protected disclosure, the deciding official (the Regional Director) would not have been presented with the conduct that resulted in his demotion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 323. The Board agreed and stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[B]ut for the allegations made by the subjects of the protected disclosure, Regional Director Kane would not have been presented with the incidents in question. Thus, we find that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. When such a showing is made, the Board will order corrective action unless the agency can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action absent the protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 323.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Observing that the WPA shields an employee "only to the extent the record supports a finding that he would not have been disciplined except for his status as a whistleblower," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 325, the Board turned to the <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> factors to determine whether BOP had established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have demoted Russell in the absence of his protected disclosure. The Board found that when Wooten made his allegations to OIA, he had "strong evidence" of Russell's misconduct and that when Campbell reported Russell's misconduct to Regional Director Kane, he had "clear evidence" to support his accusation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 326. It also found, however, that both Wooten and Campbell had strong motives to retaliate against Russell. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Finally, the Board determined that BOP had failed to produce any evidence to establish that it took similar actions against similarly situated employees who were not whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Weighing the <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> factors, the Board concluded that the evidence of Russell's misconduct was far outweighed by the presence of retaliatory motive and the absence of any evidence that BOP treated similarly situated employees the same way it treated Russell. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Accordingly, the Board ordered that corrective action be taken. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, the Board stated that it is "the existence of any motive to retaliate on the part of the <span class="Italic">agency officials</span> who were involved in the decision [to take disciplinary action]" that is to be considered. <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 687 (emphasis added). Wooten and Campbell were agency officials. The critical difference between this case and <span class="Italic">Russell</span> is that the individuals who made up the support staff of the New Haven hearing office and who complained about Ms. Carr were not "agency officials" recommending discipline. They were line employees who witnessed, and were affected by, Ms. Carr's conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The purpose of the Whistleblower Protection Act is to encourage disclosure of wrongdoing to persons who may be in a position to act to remedy it...." <span class="Italic">Horton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Whistleblowers are encouraged to make such disclosures by providing protection against retaliation for making the disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Spruill v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 690 (Fed. Cir. 1992). However, as the Board itself noted in <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> the WPA is not meant to protect employees from their own misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Department of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1527 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing cases for the proposition that whistleblowing does not shield employees who engage in wrongful conduct because they have blown the whistle); <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142 n.5 (citing to legislative history of the WPA for the proposition that the WPA is not intended to shield employees who engage in misconduct from discipline). For that reason, we decline to hold that, in considering the second <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> factor, the Board erred in not taking into account the extent to which the "support staff" employees in New Haven about whom Ms. Carr made protected disclosures were motivated to retaliate against her and therefore influenced the actions of Associate Commissioner Skoler and Judge Allard. To so hold, would, in our view, improperly shield Ms. Carr from the consequences of her misconduct, simply because, although Messrs. Skoler and Allard were not motivated to retaliate, they acted on information that came to them from "support staff" employees who were. We decline to read the WPA as requiring such a result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the third <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> factor, Ms. Carr argues that the Board erred in its analysis because it failed to take into account the fact that SSA failed to take disciplinary action against similarly situated individuals who were not whistleblowers. Specifically, Ms. Carr contends that Judge Pulcini was abusive towards her and that other ALJs in the New Haven office used vulgar and offensive language, and that they were not disciplined. Ms. Carr also contends that there were employees in the New Haven office who were rude and disrespectful, and that they were not disciplined as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For an employee to be considered similarly situated to an individual who is disciplined, it must be shown that the conduct and the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the comparison employee are similar to those of the disciplined individual. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Defense</span>, 66 MSPR 546, 549-52 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The Board found that Judge Pulcini mistreated Ms. Carr by screaming at her and allowing other employees to use vulgar language, but that he did not abuse support personnel, individuals in other agency offices, and supervisory ALJs, as Ms. Carr did. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 78 MSPR at 337. The Board therefore held that Judge Pulcini was not similarly situated to Ms. Carr because he did not engage in the same kind of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Substantial evidence supports this determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence also supports the Board's determination that the "support staff" employees of the New Haven hearing office were not similarly situated to Ms. Carr. Significantly, those employees and the ALJs were supervised under separate chains of command. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 78 MSPR at 337; <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 703 F.2d 1388, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (holding that the Board was not in error in finding that postal employees that worked in different modules under different supervisors were not similarly situated). More importantly, as an ALJ, Ms. Carr held a position of trust and responsibility that was entirely different from the positions of the employees who made complaints about her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, for the foregoing reasons, the Board did not err in holding that SSA established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have sought authority to remove Ms. Carr in the absence of her protected disclosures.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-1221-14-0828-W-1 (NP 6/4/2015), involved an individual who contributed to the initiation of an agency investigation that became misdirected, with the agency then taking disciplinary action against the appellant for her role in the investigation. The decision appeared to read out of the "clear and convincing" test whether the agency actually proves its charge--in <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> an assertion that the appellant engaged in notoriously disgraceful conduct--and instead the Board considered whether the agency provided a "sufficiently strong" reason for taking the challenged action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant serves as a contract and procurement attorney for the agency. The agency proposed to suspend the appellant for 5 days based on her involvement in an investigation into allegations that a contracting officer with whom she worked, and with whom she had a contentious relationship, harassed an intern. The record reflects that the appellant contacted the agency's security office raising concerns about the contracting officer's conduct and demeanor toward the intern and <span id="Page_3979"></span>that, in response to her allegations, a security specialist was assigned to conduct an investigation. At the security specialist's request, the appellant arranged for a meeting between the intern and the security specialist, and together they interviewed the intern at an offsite location. During the interview, the intern denied that the contracting officer acted in an inappropriate manner, and, after the interview concluded, the intern reported the appellant's conduct to several agency employees, who in turn informed the appellant's supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it suspended the appellant for 3 days because of her involvement in the interview of the intern following her disclosure and not based upon the disclosure itself. In reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge carefully balanced the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors, and on review the appellant has presented no basis for us to disagree with his findings that the 3-day suspension would have occurred in the absence of her protected disclosure. Specifically, we find no merit to the appellant's primary argument on review that the agency failed to prove its charge of notoriously disgraceful conduct by clear and convincing evidence. In an IRA appeal, the Board lacks the authority to adjudicate the merits of the underlying personnel action; rather, the Board's jurisdiction is limited to adjudicating the whistleblower allegations. <span class="Italic">See Lu</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 7. Although the Board will consider the strength of the agency's justification for taking the challenged action as part of the clear and convincing analysis, the Board does not conduct a merits-based analysis of an agency's charge of misconduct in an IRA appeal as it would in an appeal under chapter 75, and we decline to do so here <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 638 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 307, 323 n.13 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge that, based on the information available to the agency at the time of the appellant's suspension, the agency presented a sufficiently strong reason for taking the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of Transportation</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 15 (2010). We concur with the administrative judge that the agency had a strong justification for suspending the appellant based upon her involvement in an interview of an agency intern without supervisory permission at an offsite location and that her history of personal conflict with the contracting officer, at a minimum, appears to have played a role in both her reporting the actions of the contracting officer to the agency's security office and her involvement in the interview of the intern. The Board has held that, even if an employee did not actually commit the alleged misconduct upon which the challenged personnel action is based, it does not necessarily follow that the action was taken in reprisal for protected whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Phillips</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 15 (citing <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1372-73 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). As the administrative judge, we limit our review of the agency's explanation for taking the challenged personnel action to whether there is a sufficiently strong reason for taking the action based on the evidence available when the action occurred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We agree that the agency had a sufficiently strong reason for disciplining the appellant due to her involvement in actions outside of her normal job duties and the lack of confidence the agency had in her ability to work with the contracting officer following this incident. <span class="Italic">See Redschlag v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 90 (2001) (finding that the nature of the charges provided a sufficiently strong reason for taking the challenged action) <span class="Italic">see also</span> ID at 9 (noting that both supervisory and subordinate employees lacked trust and confidence in the appellant following the incident).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find adequate justification in the record for the agency's having counseled the security specialist for his involvement in the incident. Unlike the appellant, who departed from her job duties and responsibilities as a contract and procurement attorney by participating in the interview of the intern, the security specialist responded to a report of harassment and acted within his job duties by interviewing the intern and investigating the claim of harassment. We also agree with the administrative judge that the employees' different positions of employment within the agency justifies the different levels of discipline imposed, and we find no reason to differ with the administrative judge's conclusion that neither the proposing nor the deciding official had a strong motive to retaliate against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hood v. USDA</span>, 96 MSPR 438, 445 &#x00B6; 14 (2004), applied the "clear and convincing evidence" test to investigatory reprisals, determining that the agency need not show that it would have investigated the appellant had there been no unlawful animus; the agency need only show that it would have taken the same action against the appellant no matter how the information came to its attention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the causal relationship between a disclosure and a personnel action is intertwined and indirect, as when a disclosure leads to an investigation, which in turn leads to a personnel action, and the relevant facts support a finding that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action, the court and the Board have held that the agency still has an opportunity to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the disclosure<span class="Italic">. See Johns v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 106 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 25-34 (2003); <span class="Italic">Connelly v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 28, 33-36 (1994); <span class="Italic">cf. Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (shifting the burden to the agency to "demonstrate that the same personnel action would have been taken had the agency not learned of the situation in the Albany Office from Marano"). This is so because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2) "requires only that the agency demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would take the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure...; it does not require...that the adverse personnel action be based on facts 'completely separate and distinct from protected whistleblowing disclosures.'" <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Thus, the court in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> rejected Mr. Watson's central argument that, when facts supporting discipline are intertwined with facts disclosed by the whistleblower, the agency must prove by clear and convincing evidence not only that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosures but also that it would have eventually discovered the content of the disclosures from another source<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1528. The court in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> therefore also held that it did not read its decision in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> as "implying that the agency must also prove as a factual matter that it would have been able to discover the situation from someone other than Marano." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1529-30.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Simmons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 99 MSPR 28, 39-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-27 (2005), applied a clear and convincing evidentiary standard to dispel the taint of reprisal as to an investigation that produced the evidence leading to the appellant's removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the AJ's finding that the fact that Mr. Hulsey's investigation began within a few days of the appellant's disclosures is insufficient under the circumstances of this case to show that the disclosures were a contributing factor in the removal action eleven months later. The Board will consider evidence regarding the conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323&#8209;24 (1997). Under such circumstances, the agency must show by clear and convincing evidence that the evidence in question would have been gathered absent the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 324. In <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, two management officials who were the subjects of the appellant's protected disclosure, within three months of the date of the disclosure, reported certain acts of misconduct on the part of the appellant to the agency's Office of Internal Affairs (OIA). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board found that the management officials in question had a strong motive to retaliate in that they both knew about the appellant's disclosures and were subjected to OIA investigations resulting from those disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 326. The Board noted that the agency introduced no evidence concerning the management officials' motive in reporting the appellant's conduct to OIA and that, absent any evidence from the agency on the point, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to show a strong motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 326-27. The Board further found that there was no evidence showing that the management officials reported similar misconduct on the part of similarly-situated non-whistleblowers to OIA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 327. The Board concluded that the agency failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the management officials did not make their reports to OIA as a pretext for reprisal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 328.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, Mr. Hulsey's investigation did not originate from a request by a management official who was the subject of the appellant's disclosures. Instead, the investigation was requested by Senior Airman Sergio Florenz, the equipment custodian, probably in or around August 2002, but in any event well before the appellant engaged in any protected activity. Further, unlike in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, Mr. Hulsey's investigation was not an investigation into any alleged misconduct on the part of the appellant; Mr. Hulsey's mission was to determine whether the equipment custodian should be held liable for the "missing" server. Mr. Hulsey did not ask the appellant any questions about the scratched-off serial number, and it was not until a later investigation conducted by the agency's Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) that any of the appellant's misconduct came to light. We conclude, therefore, that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">Russell</span> and that there is insufficient nexus between Mr. Hulsey's investigation and the removal action to support a finding that the fact that Mr. Hulsey's investigation was initiated within a few days of the appellant's disclosure necessarily means that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the removal action taken some months later. Therefore, the proper focus in this case is whether the appellant's November 2002 disclosures were a contributing factor in the July 2003 proposed removal and the October 2003 removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide that issue, however, because we agree with the AJ's conclusion that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant even absent any alleged protected <span id="Page_3980"></span>activity. <span class="Italic">See Grubb</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 377 &#x00B6; 57 (once the Board's jurisdiction has been established, the Board may consider the merits of the appellant's case in any order it deems most efficient).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Seward v. VA</span>, DA-1221-14-0541-W-1 (NP 6/17/2016), involved an individual who complained to OSC alleging prohibited personnel practices involving selection and promotion of VA employees. OSC took no action. Then the employee sent a protest to a congressman, with the same documentation she sent to OSC. The congressman's office apparently sent a copy or summary of the constituent complaint, along with the documents, to the VA for a response. VA responded by an investigation and by proposing the employee's removal for improperly accessing the documents sent to the congressman. The proposed removal was resolved through a last chance agreement, but the employee complained to OSC that the proposed discipline was retaliatory for her disclosures to OSC and to the congressman. The agency demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the involvement of OSC and the congressional office:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the investigation of the appellant's misconduct was initiated shortly after her Congressman sent the agency a copy of the information she had provided to him. Additionally, the agency official who initiated the investigation was involved in the personnel actions that were the subject of the appellant's disclosures. Thus, the investigation could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against the appellant for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Mangano v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 44 (2008) (finding that an investigation could have been a pretext for retaliation where, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, it was convened by the agency official who was the subject of the appellant's whistleblowing). Nevertheless, the whistleblower protection statutes are not meant to protect employees from their own misconduct, and an agency is not prohibited from taking an action based on proven misconduct simply because individuals with a motive to retaliate were involved in discovering that misconduct. <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1326.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency received evidence from the appellant's Congressman that gave it reason to believe the appellant may have improperly accessed the personnel records of other agency employees. To hold that the agency could not investigate the appellant's misconduct simply because the initial source of its information was related to her protected disclosures would effectively shield the appellant from the consequences of her misconduct. We do not read the whistleblower protection statutes as requiring such a result. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Instead, we find that the appropriate inquiry in these circumstances is whether the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action had it obtained the evidence of misconduct through means other than the employee's protected disclosures.[2] Applying the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors, and for the reasons set forth below, we find that the agency has met its burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant asserts that the Congressman's office erred in forwarding the evidence in question to the agency. Even if the appellant's assertion is correct, she has not shown why the agency should have ignored evidence of misconduct simply because the Congressman's office may have forwarded that evidence in error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency had strong evidence in support of the proposed removal. In reaching her conclusion, the administrative judge thoroughly considered the hearing testimony, the record evidence that includes a report of contact documenting the appellant's improper access of individual personnel records, and the appellant's response to the proposal notice. The administrative judge also explicitly considered the appellant's claim that she had a business need to access these records so that she could report a wrongdoing to the proper authorities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response to the proposal notice, the appellant acknowledged that she was wrong to have accessed at least some of the employees' personnel records. She subsequently signed a last chance settlement agreement in which she admitted that the agency's decision to remove her was "fully justified." Although the appellant now asserts on review that she had to sign the agreement to avoid being removed, the fact that she was faced with the unpleasant choice of entering into a last chance settlement agreement or opposing a potential removal action does not rebut the presumed voluntariness of her ultimate choice, <span class="Italic">see Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, while the appellant asserts on review that she accessed the personnel documents in the performance of her official duties, she acknowledged in her hearing testimony that she "audited" an individual who was not assigned to her area of service. She also acknowledged that, when she determined that the selection of that individual was "illegal" because he did not have the requisite qualifications for the position, she did not tell her supervisor or anyone else that she had determined that his selection was improper. Rather, she printed and removed copies of the Standard Form (SF) 50s from the agency and then submitted copies of them to OSC and reported the selection as an alleged prohibited personnel practice. On cross-examination the appellant "recanted" her statements in response to the proposed removal, including her acknowledgment that it was wrong to access the employees' OPFs and her admission that she violated various policies and procedures, stating that she now has had time to think about it. However, the administrative judge considered her recantation and found that the appellant offered no explanation as to why, given her concern about the legality of the personnel actions, she did not tell her supervisor or any other member of the Human Resources Management team. T.B., another agency Human Resources Specialist, testified that, if she discovered that an employee was not qualified for a position, she would speak up. T.B. also testified that she was aware of issues involving the qualifications of one of the individuals identified in the appellant's initial complaint to OSC, but that instead of accessing that individual's OPF, she "voiced her dissatisfaction." She testified that she never took home any employees' personnel records or sent the documents anywhere outside of the agency. We therefore reject the appellant's assertion that the evidence in support of the proposed removal was weak because her job duties required her to access the personnel records in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the administrative judge erred in crediting a supervisor's testimony that the appellant had no business reason to access the records in question. She argues that it "was not reasonable" for the supervisor to remember what work instructions and audits he had assigned her a year before. Similarly, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred by considering the proposing official's testimony, and she asserts that his testimony was merely "opinion," "hearsay," and "not evidence." We disagree. The testimony in question concerns the appellant's duties, the incident in question, and why her removal was proposed, and as such is relevant and material evidence that was provided under oath, and therefore, was properly considered and weighed by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tisdell v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 44, &#x00B6; 13 (2003) (explaining that an administrative judge has wide discretion to control the proceedings before him, to receive relevant evidence, and to ensure that the record on significant issues is fully developed). Further, in <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 83 (1981), the Board noted that hearsay evidence is admissible in Board hearings "under well settled law that relevant hearsay evidence is admissible in administrative proceedings." Thus, the appellant has shown no error by the administrative judge in considering the proposing official's testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the administrative judge found no evidence of any retaliatory motive on the part of the proposing official. Rather, the administrative judge found that all of the personnel actions predated the proposing official's arrival at the facility, and thus, he played no role in the alleged prohibited personnel practices. Although the administrative judge thoroughly addressed the motive on the part of the proposing official, she did not address whether there was any motive to retaliate on the part of other agency officials. When applying the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the Board will consider any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency official who ordered the action, as well as any motive to retaliate on the part of other agency officials who influenced the decision. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1326; <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 62 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 497 F. App'x 4 (Fed. Cir. 2012). We therefore modify the initial decision to more fully address the agency's motive to retaliate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted below that A.U., the Acting HR Chief, retaliated against her based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, her initial OSC complaint. We find that A.U. could have had a strong retaliatory motive as she was previously the appellant's immediate supervisor and testified against the appellant in her prior Board appeal. A.U. also signed the SF-50s that the appellant provided in support of her initial OSC complaint in this case. Upon the agency's receipt of the documents from the Congressman, A.U. directed the appellant's immediate supervisor to investigate the appellant's actions in accessing the employees' personnel records. However, the only additional involvement A.U. had in this case after initiating the investigation is a "Report of Contact" dated May 30, 2014. That document indicates that A.U. received the signed decision from the deciding official regarding the appellant's proposed removal and that A.U. met with the appellant to deliver that decision to her. There is no evidence in the record that A.U. had any further role in investigating the appellant's misconduct or proposing her removal. Thus, while A.U. could have had a strong retaliatory motive against the appellant, we find that the strength of the evidence in support of the proposed removal far outweighs the motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1326.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, concerning the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the record reflects that the agency has had no other employees engage in similar misconduct. Because there is no evidence showing that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated, we find that the third factor is not a significant factor for the Board's analysis in the instant appeal. <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Weighing the three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it <span id="Page_3981"></span>would have issued the notice of proposed removal in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures. While the appellant appears to believe that she was punished for making protected disclosures, her disclosures themselves are separate from her improper accessing of personnel records. The appellant could have made her disclosures without improperly accessing those records; to the extent she needed the personnel records to report wrongdoing, she could have tried to obtain them through the Freedom of Information Act or other authorized means.</p>
