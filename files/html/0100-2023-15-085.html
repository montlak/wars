<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-85"><span class="space">f.</span> EEO Issue; Whistleblower Reprisal; Disparate Treatment; USERRA</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to consider EEO defenses to adverse actions based on security clearance revocations, <span class="Italic">Pangarova v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 319, 322-24 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude here that the Board is also precluded from reviewing allegations of prohibited discrimination and reprisal when such affirmative defenses relate to the revocation of a security clearance. We are persuaded that this is the correct conclusion, not only because the Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not distinguish between the merits and affirmative defenses in precluding review, but also because such defenses are so intertwined with the merits of the underlying revocation action that their adjudication by the Board would involve it in precisely the activity proscribed by the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Egan</span> decision as outside the Board's review authority--"second guessing the agency's national security determinations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 108 S. Ct. at 826.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In adjudicating affirmative defenses, the Board would be required to determine whether an employee has demonstrated a nexus between the revocation and the alleged unlawful motive<span class="Italic">. See Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 255-57, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1094-96, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981); <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986). As the Court stated in <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 255-56, 101 S. Ct. at 1095-96, the burden falls on the employer to rebut a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by producing evidence of a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. An employee may nonetheless demonstrate that such reason is pretextual either directly by showing that "a discriminatory reason more likely motivated" the agency or indirectly by showing that the agency's reason is "unworthy of credence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 255, 101 S. Ct. at 1094; Warren, 804 F.2d at 658. Thus, to decide the appellant's discrimination and reprisal claims here, the Board's inquiry would have to focus on the validity of the agency's reasons in deciding to revoke her security clearance, an inquiry which would itself require the Board to rule on the agency's security-sensitive judgments, an area in which, as the Court noted, the Board has no expertise. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 108 S. Ct. at 824-25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two recent Federal court decisions have applied the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to find that they are also without statutory authority to review the merits of agency security clearance determinations. In <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 687 F. Supp. 713, 714 (D.N.H. 1988), the employee appealed the Board's final order finding that it did not have the authority to review the merits of the security clearance determination and sustaining the agency action. On appeal to the district court, it found that the case was "on all fours" with <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, despite the employee's contention that he was entitled to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> determination of his handicap discrimination claim under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 715. The court held that a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> of the discrimination claim would require the court to undertake a substantive review of the validity of the agency's reasons for denying the clearance, contrary to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, noting that "[i]f the statutory constraints imposed by <span class="Italic">Egan</span> could be bypassed simply by alleging illegal discrimination, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> would be vitiated."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 844 F.2d 1407, 1409-11 (10th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 109 S. Ct. 73, 102 L. Ed.2d 49 (1988), the court held that it was without any statutory authority to review an agency's suspension of the security clearance of a civilian employee. It stated: "the [<span class="Italic">Egan</span>] case removes any doubt regarding the authority of federal courts to review the merits of the grant or denial of security clearances.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Board's jurisdiction is strictly prescribed by statute, lacking Article 3 review authority to review constitutional claims, we find that these decisions further support our conclusion that the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> precludes the Board from reviewing discrimination or reprisal allegations inextricably intertwined with an agency's denial of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Riddick v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged on appeal that his indefinite suspension was the result of prohibited discrimination. Specifically, the appellant argued that he was subjected to disparate treatment because a female coworker was not indefinitely suspended as he was, although the coworker was also the subject of an agency investigation. The record shows that the named coworker was cited in an incident report for being aware of the server the appellant had developed and connected to SIPRNET but not reporting it to management. The administrative judge ruled during the prehearing conference that the coworker was not a valid comparator, because the agency did not suspend her access to classified information. The initial decision did not address the disparate treatment claim. The appellant reiterates this claim on petition for review and also asserts that other employees in the Fort Knox office used the server and no one was disciplined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally cannot decide a claim of discrimination in an appeal from an action that was based on suspension or revocation of access to classified material. <span class="Italic">Hinton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 692, 697 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Hesse v.

This is because deciding the discrimination allegation would involve an inquiry into the validity of the agency's reasons for deciding to revoke the appellant's access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Hinton,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. at 697. The Board may not engage in such an inquiry under <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988). Thus, in this appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's disparate treatment allegation and cannot address it on the merits. <span class="Italic">See also Bennett v. Chertoff,</span> 425 F.3d 999, 1003 (D.C.

Reno,</span> 168 F.3d 520, 522 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (an adverse employment action based on denial or revocation of a security clearance is not actionable under Title VII)).[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The above analysis assumes without deciding that the Board could adjudicate a claim of disparate treatment alleging that another employee whose security clearance was suspended or revoked was subjected to a less severe adverse action or no adverse action at all. For example, an agency could reassign one employee who lost his security clearance to a position not requiring a clearance while removing a different employee who lost his security clearance; depending on the particular facts, such difference in treatment could constitute prohibited discrimination for which we assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> the Board could order a remedy without interfering with a security clearance determination <span class="Italic">per se.</span> Here, however, the appellant, who is represented by an attorney, does not make such a claim. Rather, he objects to the agency's decision not to revoke the security clearance of at least one other female co-worker. We cannot consider the appellant's claim because to do so would be to delve into issues that are "inextricably intertwined" with the agency's authority over security clearance issues. <span class="Italic">See Pangarova v.

<p class="Body-Text">However, the Board has held open the possibility of a viable affirmative defense that is brought in such a way that it would not require the Board to review the substance of the underlying security clearance determination, e.g., a defense that solely goes to the issue of penalty and is based on the agency's treatment of similarly situated individuals outside of the appellant's protected class. <span class="Italic">Helms v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 843 F.3d 931, 932-35 (Fed. Cir. 2016), affirming the Board, determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wilson worked as a civilian Resource Analyst at the Nuclear Propulsion Directorate at the Naval Sea Systems Command, a position that required him to hold a DOE security clearance ("Q clearance"). On January 8, 2014, the DOE suspended Wilson's security clearance. The DOE listed as security concerns that Wilson: (1) knowingly brought a personal firearm onto a Navy facility in violation of regulations and directions he received; (2) armed himself with a personal weapon while acting as a Metropolitan Police Department ("MPD") reserve officer, contrary to regulations; and (3) made false statements and false time and attendance entries to his civilian employer, the Naval Reserve Unit and the MPD....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wilson argued to the DOE that the clearance revocation was based on his service as a Naval Reservist, in violation of USERRA. Unpersuaded, on July 25, 2014, the DOE revoked Wilson's security clearance. On July 29, 2014, based on the DOE's revocation, Wilson's supervisor at the Department of the Navy proposed Wilson's removal. Wilson filed a response to the Navy's proposal, arguing that the revocation violated USERRA and his due process rights. Nevertheless, on September 12, 2014, the Navy removed Wilson from federal service because he no longer had the security clearance that was a prerequisite for his position. Wilson appealed to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Wilson argued that the agency revoked his security clearance based on his military service, and the revocation was the proximate cause of his dismissal; therefore, the Board must examine the merits of the revocation to determine whether there was a violation of USERRA....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wilson maintains on appeal that the Board should have reviewed whether the security clearance revocation was in violation of USERRA. Specifically, he argues that: (1) USERRA necessarily authorizes review of security clearance determinations, (2) alternatively, the Board could have reviewed whether his revocation was "initiated" based on a discriminatory motivation without reviewing the merits of the revocation itself, and (3) irrespective of his revocation, he was entitled to reemployment in a similar position under USERRA. None of these arguments are persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court "established that MSPB review of an agency's denial or revocation of a security clearance is limited to determining whether the agency provided minimal due process protection." <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dep't of Def</span>., 688 F.3d 1330, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529-31). That is the well-established limit of our review; "neither this court nor the [Board] has authority to review the charge that...discrimination w[as] the reason[&#8197;] for revocation of the security clearance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Congress has not "specifically...provided otherwise" in this case, because USERRA makes no mention of security clearances, explicitly or otherwise. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530. Nor does Wilson--relying solely on USERRA on appeal--raise a constitutional claim that might transcend these limitations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Dubbs v. CIA</span>, 866 F.2d 1114, 1120 (9th Cir. 1989) (permitting review of a security clearance determination on Equal Protection grounds).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wilson's shift in the alternative to the initiation of revocation--as opposed to the "merits"--relies on a distinction without a difference. The core of Wilson's allegation is that his security clearance revocation was initiated based on "false" complaints and accusations. Because the DOE's security determination was based on the information contained therein, it evaluated the trustworthiness of those statements as part of its determination--and specifically found them reliable. If the Board--or this court--were to reverse or remand on the basis that those statements were false, it would therefore necessarily involve "second-guessing...national security determinations" in abrogation of <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148, 1155 (Fed. Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wilson's reliance on <span class="Italic">Rattigan v. Holder</span>, 689 F.3d 764 (D.C. Cir. 2012), is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Rattigan</span>, the D.C. Circuit stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The question, then, is whether we must bar reporting and referral claims altogether, as the government urges, or whether we can sufficiently minimize the chilling effect of Title VII liability by narrowing the scope of such claims. We ask this question because it is our duty not only to follow Egan, but also to 'preserv[e] to the maximum extent possible Title VII's important protections against workplace discrimination and retaliation.'...Title VII claims based on <span class="Italic">knowingly false</span> reporting present no serious risk of chill, [so] we believe that claims of knowingly false security reports or referrals can coexist with <span class="Italic">Egan</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Rattigan</span>, 689 F.3d at 770 (quoting <span class="Italic">Rattigan v. Holder</span>, 643 F.3d 975, 984 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). Even if this court were to follow the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Rattigan</span>, which we are not required to do, the "knowingly false" requirement of <span class="Italic">Rattigan</span> has not been met here given the DOE's findings of reliability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is Wilson entitled to reemployment independent of his USERRA discrimination claim. USERRA does provide a right to reemployment following "absence...necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a). But when an employee has returned to employment and is <span class="Italic">subsequently</span> terminated due to antimilitary <span class="Italic">animus</span>, no claim exists under &#x00A7; 4312, even if a claim for discrimination under &#x00A7; 4311 might otherwise be available. <span class="Italic">See Pittman v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 486 F.3d 1276, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Wilson does not dispute either that he returned to work after his alleged military service or that the only reemployment claim he asserted was under &#x00A7; 4312. He thus has not asserted an actionable reemployment claim.</p>
