<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-72"><span class="space">6.</span> Position of Trust; Fiduciary Duty; Loss of Trust</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Violations of trust necessary to the employer-employee relationship affect service efficiency. <span class="Italic">Giesler v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 3 MSPR 277, 281, 3 MSPB 367 (1980). If an employee owes a fiduciary duty toward an agency, the Board will hold the employee to "an even higher standard of conduct" in reviewing a penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Singletary v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 553, 559 &#x00B6; 12 (2003). The potential for rehabilitation seems inversely linked to the degree of trust and independence vested in the position held by an appellant. "The Board has held supervisors and employees with a fiduciary duty toward their employing agency to a higher standard of conduct when analyzing the appropriate penalty." <span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 8, 13 (1997) (sustaining the removal of a postmaster who essentially loaned himself and repaid approximately $430 of postal funds); <span class="Italic">see Myers v. USDA</span>, 88 MSPR 565, 576 &#x00B6; 35 (2001) (employee who processed loans in a position involving fiduciary duties was removed for misconduct that included a failure to pay debts that the appellant incurred on behalf of the government).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Demotion was appropriate for a community programs administrator who, although not intentionally violating agency rules, failed to exercise good judgment in the execution of his official duties when he occupied a position calling for responsible judgment. <span class="Italic">Lindsey v. DOJ</span>, 16 MSPR 310, 312-14 (1983), <span class="Italic">followed in Wilson v. VA</span>, 74 MSPR 65, 69 (1997) ("Poor judgment is particularly egregious when the employee manifesting it occupies a supervisory position of substantial responsibility and trust within law enforcement."). <span class="Italic">Lindsey</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The presiding official sustained charges that the appellant misused his official position by seeking special considerations for a personal friend from an agency contractor and by seeking an honorarium from the same contractor for a guest speaker....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2365"></span>The appellant's acts, though intentional, were not ones which appear to have been purposefully designed to violate written or unwritten ethical standards of the federal prisons. Rather, they were acts demonstrative of poor judgment from a person of whom a high degree of responsible judgment was expected. Nor does the evidence support a conclusion that the employee attempted to actively conceal his questionable activities. His error, therefore, was not one of intentional violation of agency rules but was, instead, a failure to exercise good judgment in the execution of his official position. Although the appellant contends that he did nothing wrong, he does concede that he may have made errors in judgment for which he is responsible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Poor judgment, however, is particularly egregious when the employee manifesting it occupies a supervisory position of substantial responsibility and trust within a law enforcement agency. The appellant's position required frequent contacts with persons outside the agency and, thus, he was placed in a position to significantly affect the public's view of the agency and its mission. In that situation, regardless of whether one is classified as a law enforcement officer, the highest degree of personal and professional ethics may be reasonably demanded.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Ray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 97 MSPR 101, 139 &#x00B6; 63 (2004), the Board was sensitive to allegations of misconduct, including one involving false reports to superior officers, by a GS-13 Executive Assistant for base operations at an overseas installation; important was the significance of the appellant's position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...With respect to the nature and seriousness of the appellant's offense and its relation to the appellant's duties, position, and responsibilities, COL Gilmore testified that the appellant's position, as the second in command on Torii Station for base operations, was very important and that the appellant's misconduct undermined the credibility of his commander and higher headquarters, created an environment of intimidation and fear, and undermined the overall effectiveness of the 10th ASG to accomplish its mission.... COL Gilmore also verified that he considered the appellant's length of service (over 40 years in the military and as a Department of the Army civilian) and his work record (presumptively satisfactory for the preponderance of his civilian and military career) and that he did not consider the appellant a good candidate for rehabilitation.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may show a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by three means: (1) a rebuttable presumption in certain egregious circumstances, (2) preponderant evidence that the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or co-workers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance, or (3) preponderant evidence that the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Kruger</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 74. We need not determine whether the appellant's conduct is sufficiently egregious to create a rebuttable presumption of nexus because the agency has presented evidence of the specific impact of the misconduct. The deciding official, Albert Godinez, stated in his declaration that the appellant performed his duties with little oversight, and that the agency needed to have trust in his judgment and integrity. He also explained that the appellant's position sometimes presented opportunities for an employee to put his own interests above those of the government, and he indicated that the appellant's actions in this case demonstrated a willingness to put his interests first. He stated that he had lost confidence in the appellant's integrity and judgment. The deciding official's declaration establishes that the appellant's conduct affected management's trust and confidence in his job performance. Therefore, under the particular circumstances of this case, nexus is established.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A physician was removed when his medical licenses briefly lapsed and he treated one patient during the period of that lapse. The incident, according to the Federal Circuit, justified removal because of the potential loss of trust by the patient community in the agency, <span class="Italic">Gumbs v. DHHS</span>, 620 Fed. Appx. 945, 950-52, 954-55 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP) (Judge Dyk dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Gumbs' characterization of the harm from his unlicensed practice of medicine as "speculative" misses the point because it does not account for the mission of the agency. As explained by Dr. Scott, it is important to the clinic to maintain the trust of the Native American community, and any lapse of responsibility to maintaining adequate standards--such as by violating its own bylaws--threatened to break that trust. Even if no harm to the agency specifically resulted from his treatment of the patient on May 8, on a more general level, Dr. Gumbs' misconduct had the potential to cause significant harm to the agency if it caused the Native American community to perceive that the clinic was not adhering to its internal procedures and was not dedicated to providing responsible medical care. In short, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding of a nexus between Dr. Gumbs' misconduct and an adverse effect on the agency.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Dr. Gumbs also argues that his removal denigrated the agency's mission by delaying patient care and increasing the workload of the remaining care providers while IHS was hiring a new physician. But the focus of the efficiency inquiry is its impact of the employee's misconduct on the agency, not the impact of the imposed penalty itself. <span class="Italic">See Mings</span>, 813 F.2d at 389-90. While Dr. Gumbs' allegations may be true, they do not negate evidence of a nexus between Dr. Gumbs' misconduct and an adverse effect on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Gumbs argues that because the lapse of his medical license was unintentional and inadvertent, and that his misconduct was not willful and did not appear to result in any actual harm, a lesser sanction would have been more appropriate. But our role is not to reweigh anew the evidence before the Board. Dr. Scott explained that although a lesser sanction was possible, he believed Dr. Gumbs need to be removed "to make sure that [Dr. Gumb's misconduct] d[idn't] happen again at [the clinic]." We find no abuse of discretion in the Board's determination that the agency's penalty, in view of the sustained charges that Dr. Gumbs let his license expire and then practiced medicine without a license, is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Circuit Judge Dyk, dissenting, believed removal so draconian as to warrant mitigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Dr. Gumbs has had nearly twenty-two years of federal service, with no prior disciplinary record. At worst, his medical license lapsed for a period of nine days because he failed to pay $100 of the application fee, despite his "many attempts to get his medical license renewed" prior to the deadline. And on the morning after his license may have expired, Dr. Gumbs saw a patient or two, whose records were then reviewed by his supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our prior cases reflect an important responsibility to remand for determination of a more appropriate penalty in the rare case where the agency's choice of penalty is grossly disproportionate to the offense. In my view, this is such a case, and I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A removal was sustained for unofficial use of a government leased plane by an aerial photographer. The Board reasoned that because the appellant's position required the trust of supervisors and because trust, once lost, is not readily regained, the rehabilitation of the appellant, even if possible through a plan suggested by the AJ that provided checks on appellant's discretionary use of the aircraft, might be a solution unresponsive to the problem of loss of trust.

<p class="Body-Text">The inverse relation between the level of trust and the level of misconduct needed to sustain discipline is manifested in cases involving law enforcement officers: the Board is disinclined to find potential for rehabilitation.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board sustained removal, for loss of management trust and confidence, of a "senior civilian personnel policy maker" who became involved in a romantic relationship with a second-level subordinate that led, in the Board's judgment, to diminution of the authority of the supervisor, who reported to the appellant and supervised the appellant's friend. <span class="Italic">Dolezal v.

DOJ</span>, SF-0752-11-0505-I-1 (NP 5/7/2013), eschewed generalized, unsupported agency protestations of loss of trust and confidence in a criminal investigator involved in an extramarital affair when a significant component of the agency's case also raised nexus issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its proposal letter, the agency cited the serious nature of the appellant's misconduct as the reason that it lost its trust and confidence in him. The deciding official's written analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors notes that the nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the appellant's duties, position, and responsibilities indicate that the appellant "demonstrated a lack of maturity," which the deciding official describes as "a necessary requirement to execute the duties of a DEA Special Agent." At the hearing, the deciding official similarly testified to the general proposition that the appellant comported himself in a manner that was contrary to the high standards expected of a DEA Agent. Specifically, the deciding official claimed that, because JM knew the appellant was a DEA Special Agent, and the behavior at issue would tend to bring disgrace or ridicule upon the agency, there was a direct nexus to the appellant's employment. Nevertheless, the agency introduced no evidence to indicate that anyone other than the appellant's family and those who were directly involved in the case ever learned about the incident. Additionally, when questioned about the appellant's supervisors' loss of confidence in his job performance, the deciding official testified that he did not actually interview any of the appellant's supervisors, and the agency did not call any of the appellant's supervisors to testify.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, the agency failed to link the appellant's duties to the sustained misconduct. Without a more detailed description as to exactly how the appellant's misconduct diminished the agency's trust and confidence in his job performance, with specific reference to his duties and to the impact of his misconduct on those duties, the agency fails to establish the requisite nexus. As our reviewing court explained in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2000), misconduct that is private in nature and does not affect an employee's official responsibilities in any direct and obvious way is generally insufficient to justify removal from a civil service position. On the other hand, off-duty conduct that is inconsistent with the agency's mission and that undermines confidence in the employee can be sufficient to justify the employee's removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1361; <span class="Italic">see Doe</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-23, and cases cited therein. Among the cases that the Board cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Doe</span> is <span class="Italic">Norton v. Macy</span>, 417 F.2d 1161 (D.C. Cir. 1969), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that an agency must demonstrate "some reasonably foreseeable, specific connection between an employee's potentially embarrassing conduct and the efficiency of the service" and that, without such a connection, "the unparticularized and unsubstantiated conclusion that such possible embarrassment threatens the quality of the agency's performance is an arbitrary ground for dismissal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1167. The agency has demonstrated no such specific connection in the instant case. Accordingly, we find that the agency's conclusory presentation is insufficient to carry its burden of establishing nexus as to its third charge, Conduct Unbecoming a DEA Agent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the agency also challenges the administrative judge's decision to mitigate the penalty. The nexus requirement, for purposes of whether an agency has shown that its action promotes the efficiency of the service, means there must be a clear and direct relationship between the articulated grounds for an adverse action and either the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate government interest. <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 585, 596 (1981), <span class="Italic">modified by Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 75 n.2 (1987). Although we find herein that the agency proved that the appellant's conduct was indeed unbecoming of a DEA agent, because it failed to establish a nexus between that misconduct and the efficiency of the service, the agency ultimately failed to establish its third charge. When, like here, not all of the agency's charges are sustained, the Board will consider carefully whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 308 (1981). The agency's penalty selection should be mitigated only to the extent necessary to bring it within the parameters of reasonableness, i.e., a maximum reasonable penalty standard should be applied. <span class="Italic">Payne v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 646, 651 (1996). Moreover, in applying this standard, the Board must take into consideration the failure of the agency to sustain all of its supporting specifications. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Department of Justice</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 56, 62-63 (1988)). That failure may require, or contribute to, a finding that the agency's penalty is not reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may determine that a supervisor lacks continued trust and confidence in an employee if the supervisor proposed an adverse action recommending removal, despite earlier statements concerning settlement of the case for a lesser penalty. <span class="Italic">See Hosey v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 441, 443 (1990) (appeal by a distribution clerk). An Assistant United States Attorney was removed for charges that included failure to follow agency and official policies regarding plea agreements. <span class="Italic">Byrnes v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 551, 554 (2002) ("in light of the great level of trust and responsibility an AUSA must have with the courts, other federal agencies, and the public, the penalty of removal was reasonable based on the seriousness of the sustained charges and their relationship to the appellant's AUSA duties, position and responsibilities"); <span class="Italic">cf. Bross v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 94 MSPR 662 (2003) (employee's removal for using a government computer to access a website containing child pornography; although a second level supervisor would likely have retained the employee, the third level supervisor lacked the trust necessary to continue his employment), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Bross v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 389 F.3d 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some agency managers are quick to testify that they no longer trust an appellant with an otherwise unblemished record who has committed an infraction. Although the Board readily accepts conclusory managerial statements about lack of trust in appellants, the Board may discount the conclusion. In <span class="Italic">Gootee v. VA</span>, 36 MSPR 526, 531 (1988), the Board declined to accept the deciding official's assertion that the appellant could no longer be trusted. This testimony was "rendered suspect in view of the administrative judge's finding that the deciding official did not like the appellant's management style and was motivated by a desire to eliminate an employee with whom she was not compatible professionally." <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gooch v.

Management's apprehension for the safety of subordinate employees is a valid concern which is properly considered in determining whether nexus has been established.").

<p class="Body-Text">As to off-duty conduct that resulted in criminal charges, the Board declined to credit unspecific assertions of loss of trust and confidence in an employee, <span class="Italic">Sforza v. VA</span>, AT-0752-12-0304-I-1 (NP 5/24/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency asserts that the deciding official lost faith and trust in the appellant's ability to perform his duties because of the "violent crime" set forth in the police report, as the administrative judge found, the agency did not establish the particular behavior underlying the appellant's guilty plea to the lesser offense of felony battery. Moreover, the agency did not assert or demonstrate below that the nexus requirement was proven because the deciding official lost trust and confidence in the appellant. Although the proposal notice indicates that the Criminal Conduct charge caused the proposing official to "lose faith, trust, and confidence in [the appellant's] ability to perform the duties of [his] position," there is no mention of a loss of trust and confidence in the decision notice; nor is there any other evidence in the record establishing such a loss of trust and confidence, despite the administrative judge's issuance of an order requiring the agency to prove nexus by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If several levels of employees are involved in an incident, or in failing to prevent the incident, the Board may discount protestations of loss of trust in the appellant if the agency imposes comparatively light discipline on the higher-level employees. <span class="Italic">See Watkins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 146, 148 (1985). The "trust and confidence" argument may also be weakened if an agency fails to act on a report of misconduct and, during the period of inaction, promotes the appellant, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Hovanec v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 340, 346 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hile the agency asserts that it did not receive "documentation" of the appellant's indictment and guilty plea until 1993, it does not deny that it was aware of the appellant's off-duty misconduct when it promoted him to the supervisory position. It appears that if the agency were seriously concerned with loss of trust and confidence in the appellant's fitness as a supervisor, it could have conducted its own investigation into the appellant's charged misconduct or simply have obtained a copy of the indictment. At the very least, the agency could have postponed the appellant's promotion pending the outcome of the criminal indictment. Rather, it chose to promote him, totally ignoring the pending criminal charges. Having decided to do so, the agency cannot now claim that it has lost trust and confidence in the appellant as a supervisor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Birch v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3076) ("In addition, the agency's contention that it lost confidence in Ms. Birch's trustworthiness as a result of this incident is undermined by the fact that it allowed her to remain on duty during the 19-month period prior to the initiation of the removal action while an investigation was being conducted and during a six-month period after learning the results of the investigation.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency's assessment of loss of trust in an employee can be supported in part by the appellant's conduct at the Board hearing. In <span class="Italic">Richardson v. RTC</span>, 66 MSPR 302, 313 (1995), the Board went beyond its traditional analysis. The agency's contention that it lost trust and confidence in the appellant, an asset marketing specialist, was buttressed by the appellant's presentation "under oath at the Board's hearing, a version of events which we do not credit to explain the purported circumstances of her misdemeanor offense."</p>
