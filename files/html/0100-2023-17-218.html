<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-216"><span class="space">f.</span> Accretion of Duties</h5>
<p class="noindent">The statutory bar to an arbitrator's resolution of a classification issue creates considerable difficulties in awarding temporary promotions based on accretion of duties claims arising from assignment of higher level duties to the grievant's permanent position. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2142 and Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot</span>, 58 FLRA 416, 417 (2003), addressed issues pertaining to accretion of duties in conjunction with claims to temporary promotions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121 (c)(5) of the Statute, grievances concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" are precluded by law from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure. When the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by, the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Local 2142,</span> 51 FLRA at 1142 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2025, </span>50 FLRA 39, 42 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Local 2025)). </span>When the substance of a grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record in this case, it appears that the grievant seeks an upgrade in his permanent position based on the claim that higher-graded duties have been added to that position. Consistent with its decision in <span class="Italic">Local 2025, </span>the Authority, in <span class="Italic">Local 2142, </span>found that, because "the substance of the grievances concerned the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by, the grievants in their permanent positions," the grievances concerned the classification of the grievants' permanent positions and were "precluded by law under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure." <span class="Italic">Local 2142, </span>51 FLRA at 1142-43. Because the grievance in this case also concerns the grade level of the duties performed by the grievant in his permanent position, it concerns a matter relating to the classification of that position. Based on <span class="Italic">Local 2142, </span>therefore, it is excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure as a matter of law under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's dismissal of the grievance as non-arbitrable was consistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reliance on materials pertaining to non-competitive promotions based on an accretion of higher-graded duties to an employee's existing position is inapposite. In those circumstances, at least one condition precedent to a promotion is a classification determination upgrading the position. <span class="Italic">Accord Matter of Patrick</span> <span class="Italic">J Fleming, </span>Comp. Gen. Decision No. B-191413 (September 19, 1978) (unpublished). The mere performance of additional duties is not sufficient in and of itself to warrant an upgrade. As noted above, however, an exception to this principle is where a collective bargaining agreement requires a temporary promotion for a detail to a higher-graded position. Nothing in the record of this case suggests that the grievant was seeking such a temporary promotion.</p>
<p class="noindent">That the grievant was assigned sufficient higher-graded duties that would qualify him for promotion through reclassification through accretion of duties does not warrant an award of a temporary promotion, even if the grievant received all of the grade-controlling duties of a higher-graded employee who vacated his position, <span class="Italic">SSA v. AFGE Local 1923</span>, 60 FLRA 62, 64-65 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, grievances concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" are precluded by law from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure. Thus, an arbitrator is barred from resolving any grievance concerning the classification of a position that does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) in the context of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c), which defines the term as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by the Office of Personnel Management under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA 386, 389 (1990); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, New Cumberland Army Depot</span>, 21 FLRA 968, 969-70 (1986). Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. Similarly, where the substance of a grievance concerns the accretion of higher-graded duties to an existing position, the grievance concerns a classification matter. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 1858</span>, 59 FLRA 713 (2004) (<span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858</span>)<span class="Italic">. </span>Where, however, the substance of a grievance concerns whether a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by <span id="page_2090"></span>reason of having temporarily performed the duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, N.C</span>., 42 FLRA 795 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that, when the incumbent in the GS-10 position retired, her duties were assigned to the grievant's position. The Union concedes that the grievant "accreted the duties of a properly graded and classified [GS-10 employee], upon her termination." Although the grievant later sought a temporary promotion to the GS-10 IS position, the Authority has recognized that a mere claim that a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion will not cure a grievance that pertains to temporary duties assigned to the grievant's permanent position. <span class="Italic">See LIUNA, Local 28</span>, 56 FLRA 324, 326 n.2 (2000). As explained below, we believe that the Arbitrator's findings demonstrate that the grievance concerned a classification matter and, as such, that the award is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing the grievance, the Arbitrator initially examined the grade-controlling duties of the retired GS-10 IS employee's position. The Arbitrator found that the grade-controlling duties of that position were assigned to and performed by the grievant more than 25 percent of the grievant's time. In making these factual findings, the Arbitrator then concluded that "[t]he accretion of duties is a recognized basis for a temporary promotion for higher grade of duties[.]" The Arbitrator's conclusion on this point is incorrect. As the Authority explained more fully in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858</span>, and cases cited therein, a claim that an accretion of higher-graded duties justifies a temporary promotion is a matter that concerns classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). As such, it is excluded from the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is apparent in this case that the Arbitrator addressed the duties that were permanently assigned to the grievant's position and the grade level of those duties, following the elimination of the GS-10 IS position. The Authority previously has held that grievances concerning the grade level of duties assigned to permanent positions relate to the classification of those positions and may not be grieved under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 212, 215 (1996) (arbitrator correctly determined that grievance, claiming entitlement to temporary promotion under parties' agreement, concerned grade level of duties assigned to grievant's permanent position, and, as such, was not arbitrable because it concerned a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)). The Authority has also consistently found that promotions due to accretion of duties constitute reclassifications. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE Local 1858</span>. We reach the same result here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's remedy provides additional support for finding that the Arbitrator improperly decided a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). In addition to ordering back pay, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to temporarily promote the grievant to the GS-10 position and to pay her "front pay at the grade 10 level until her job is reclassified or the duties she is performing are removed." This remedy indicates that, in the Arbitrator's view, the performance of higher-graded GS-10 IS duties by the grievant was of an on-going, permanent nature, thereby defeating any claim that the performance of GS-10 duties was for a temporary period of time. Consistent with the reasons expressed above, we find the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">An accretion of duties justification was rejected as insufficient to support temporary promotion through the grievance process in <span class="Italic">USDA, Food &#x0026; Consumer Serv. and NTEU Chap. 265</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-176.html">60 FLRA 978</a>, 981-82 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala</span>., 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, grievances concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" are precluded by law from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) in the context of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c), which defines the term as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by the Office of Personnel Management under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA 386, 389 (1990); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, New Cumberland Army Depot</span>, 21 FLRA 968, 969-70 (1986). Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. Similarly, where the substance of a grievance concerns the accretion of higher-graded duties to an existing position, the grievance concerns a classification matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 60 FLRA 62 (2004) (<span class="Italic">SSA)</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, however, the substance of a grievance concerns whether a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having temporarily performed the duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point, N.C.</span>, 42 FLRA 795 (1991). The Authority has recognized that a mere claim that a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion will not cure a grievance that pertains to temporary duties assigned to the grievant's permanent position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 60 FLRA at 64.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievant claimed that she had been performing higher-graded work of a GS-12 position since sometime in early 2000. The Arbitrator found that the Agency had assigned the grievant GS-12 grade-controlling duties since March 2000 by virtue of the fact that the Agency had "detail[ed]" the grievant "to higher level work." As a consequence, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was entitled to be temporarily promoted under the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the grievance concerned a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. In this connection, the record reflects that the grievant sought, and attempts were made, to "upgrade" the grievant's permanent position after the grievant began performing higher-graded duties. The Agency subsequently conducted a desk audit of the grievant's position that revealed that the grievant was in fact performing higher-graded GS-12 work. Such actions are consistent with attempts to determine the proper grade level to assign to the duties being performed by the grievant, which constitutes a classification matter within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). Rather than reclassifying the grievant's position at the GS-12 level, however, the Agency removed the grade-controlling duties from the grievant's position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has held that grievances concerning the grade level of duties assigned to permanent positions relate to the classification of those positions and may not be grieved under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 212, 215 (1996) (arbitrator correctly determined that grievance, claiming entitlement to temporary promotion under parties' agreement, concerned grade level of duties assigned to grievant's permanent position, and, as such, was not arbitrable because it concerned a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5))<span class="Italic">. </span>We reach the same result here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator resolved an issue that involved the classification of the grievant's grade level, we find that the award is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. Accordingly, we set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the employee is assigned extra duties for a long period of time, the "temporary" nature of the claim to promotion may be lost by the prolonged nature of the realignment of duties, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Polk and NAGE Local R5-168</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-003.html">61 FLRA 8</a>, 12 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has distinguished between two situations in assessing whether a grievance concerns the classification of a position.&#x2003;Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to, and performed by, the grievant, the Authority finds that the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev., La. State Office, New Orleans, La</span>., 53 FLRA 1611, 1616 (1998). However, where the substance of the grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the Authority has long held that the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority has also noted the need to distinguish between temporary promotion claims based upon duties temporarily assigned to an employee (which is properly a temporary promotion claim) and temporary promotion claims based upon duties that are not temporarily assigned to an employee (which is not properly a temporary promotion claim). <span class="Italic">LIUNA, Local 28</span>, 56 FLRA 324, 326 n.2 (2000). In the present instance, it is apparent that the grievant was not handling the alternate TCO and TCO duties on a temporary basis. The length of the duties involved (over five years) and the formal nature of the assignment of the alternate TCO and TCO duties lead to this conclusion, especially in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. As such, the entitlement to additional compensation for the periods of time awarded by the Arbitrator pertain to the permanent duties of the grievant's position, and constitute a classification determination under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). As the Arbitrator's finding constitutes a classification determination, it is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute and must be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145</span>, 70 FLRA 49, 50-51 (2016) ("In <span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>, the Authority found that an employee was not assigned temporary <span id="page_2091"></span>duties when the employee had not only performed the duties of a higher-graded position for over five years, but the employee had also been formally appointed to that position. Here, unlike <span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>, the grievant was not appointed to the GS-7 position. As the Arbitrator found, the grievant performed higher-graded duties only when the selectee was unavailable, and ultimately another employee filled the position permanently after the selectee retired.").</p>
