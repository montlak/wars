<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 315.801 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Probationary period; when required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The first year of service of an employee who is given a career or career-conditional appointment under this part is a probationary period when the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Was appointed from a competitive list of eligibles established under subpart C of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Was reinstated under subpart D of this part unless during any period of service which affords a current basis for reinstatement, the employee completed a probationary period or served with competitive status under an appointment which did not require a probationary period....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 315.401 (2022), subject to conditions stated in the complete regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency authority</span>. Subject to part 335 of this chapter and paragraph (b) of this section, an agency may appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position a person who previously was employed <span id="Page_105"></span>under career or career-conditional appointment (or equivalent).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Swick v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-17-0008-W-1, n.3 (NP 5/12/2023) ("In this case, the agency appointed the appellant by reinstatement to a competitive-service position. The appellant would not be required to serve a probationary period under her most recent appointment if she was reinstated pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401 and 'during any period of service which affords a current basis for reinstatement, [she] completed a probationary period or served with competitive status under an appointment which did not require a probationary period.' 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(2); Dodson, 111 M.S.P.R. 504, &#x00B6; 9.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-16-0486-I-1 (NP 11/8/2022), related career reinstatement and completion of probation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may appoint by reinstatement to a competitive-service position an individual who previously was employed under a career or career-conditional appointment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a), the first year of service of an employee who is given a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service is a probationary period when, among other things, the employee was reinstated under the authority set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401, unless during any period of service that affords a current basis for reinstatement, the employee completed a probationary period or served with competitive status under an appointment that did not require a probationary period. <span class="Italic">Abdullah v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 99, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2009)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Standard Form 50 documenting the appellant's appointment reflects that he was appointed by reinstatement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401. Additionally, the agency does not dispute that the appellant was appointed to his position by reinstatement. However, as the appellant concedes, and as the undisputed record establishes, the appellant did not complete a probationary period while serving in the position from which he was reinstated, resigning from that position after only 5 months. Thus, even if the appellant's prior service were considered under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(2), he still would not have completed the requisite 1-year probationary period, and would not have any statutory right of appeal to the Board.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We also agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's prior service cannot be counted towards the completion of his probationary period under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b) because it was followed by a break in service of more than 30 calendar days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulation permits, but does not require, use of a reinstatement.

Ms. Crawford was not preference eligible, did not complete the career tenure requirements, and her appointment at issue was more than three years after her prior career conditional appointment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), an individual in the competitive service is an "employee" if he is "not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment" or he "has completed 1 year of current continuous service." "Current continuous service" is a period of employment immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in federal civilian employment of a workday. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. Even if not "continuous," prior service may count toward the one-year probationary period requirement if the service was rendered at the same agency, in the same line of work, and with no more than one 30-day-or-less break in service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, the probationary period is sometimes not required if the individual is "reinstated."

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Mr. Kent has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), because he was serving in a probationary period at the time of termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Mr. Kent was terminated less than one year after he started working for the IRS. And because his previous federal civilian employment had occurred years prior, it could not count toward the probationary period. The only issue, then, is whether Mr. Kent was reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kent's appointment SF-50 (Notification of Personnel Action Form) states that his appointment was subject to completion of a one-year probationary period. Regulations require that any individual appointed to a position in the competitive service by selection from a certificate of eligibles must serve a one-year probationary period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(1). The Board found that Mr. Kent's selection was from a certificate of eligibles. Indeed, the preferred federal hiring policy is through appointment via open competition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.101(a). Consistently, Mr. Kent's SF-50s use the OPM codes 101 and 100, which reflect selection from a certificate. In contrast, Mr. Kent's previous SF-50s from reinstated positions use the OPM code 140. Additionally, the appointment SF-50 states "OPM DELE AGR CERT NO" as the legal authority for the appointment, which the Board reasonably found to indicate a delegation to the agency of OPM's authority to assemble a certificate of eligibles. S.A. 5 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.301).[3] Likewise, the word "reinstatement" was absent from Mr. Kent's appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Mr. Kent argues that the lack of a specific numeric code for this authority on the face of the SF-50 renders the authority invalid. Though the Board chided the agency for not including the certificate number, the Board nonetheless disagreed with Mr. Kent, finding no legal authority in support of his proposition. We agree with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kent argued before the Board that the IRS "flagrantly misapplied" OPM rules and "misclassified" him, rendering him a probationary employee. But this allegation is conclusory. He further argued that he was "not initially chosen for 1 of many (10 or more) contact representative positions" and that "after ascertaining that information," he "called the [IRS] Director," "informed the Director of [his] concerns" and reinstatement eligibility, and "subsequently received a phone call and was informed to report to" work. Even taken as true, Mr. Kent's allegations do not plausibly establish that he was reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, Mr. Kent argues that because he attained "career" tenure status, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.301(b), 315.201(c)(2), the agency was <span class="Italic">required</span> to reinstate him--or at the very least, no new probationary period was required. Again we disagree. As discussed above, career status can <span class="Italic">qualify</span> an individual for reinstatement. But reinstatement is a matter of discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a). And without reinstatement, Mr. Kent was required to complete a probationary period before qualifying as an "employee" with appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401, an agency has the authority to appoint by reinstatement to a competitive-service position an individual who previously was employed under a career or career-conditional appointment.[6] There is no time limit on the reinstatement eligibility of a preference eligible or an individual who completed the service requirement for career tenure. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(b). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(2), the first year of service of an employee who is given a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service is a probationary period when the employee was reinstated under subpart D <span id="Page_106"></span>(5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401), "unless during any period of service which affords a current basis for reinstatement, the employee completed a probationary period or served with competitive status under an appointment which did not require a probationary period." If an employee's appointment was a reinstatement that meets the criteria of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(2), then he was not required to complete a probationary period under that section, and thus, he may be an "employee" with adverse-action appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See Abdullah v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;A "reinstatement" is defined as "the noncompetitive reemployment for service as a career or career-conditional employee of a person formerly employed in the competitive service who had a competitive status or was serving probation when he was separated from the service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(15)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may appoint an employee as a "career reinstatement" but still record an obligation for a probationary period on the SF-50.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Standard Form 50 (SF-50) documenting the appellant's appointment indicates that she was appointed to her YB-02 Legal Technician position effective May 12, 2008, subject to completion of a 1-year probationary period. The SF-50 also indicates that the nature of the action was "[r]einstatement career" under the legal authority of "Reg[.] 9901.516" and that her tenure was "[p]ermanent." The certificate of eligible candidates from which the appellant was selected indicates that she was a non-competitive candidate. Another SF-50 shows that she was terminated effective August 15, 2008. The appellant has not alleged that she had 1 year of current continuous service when the agency terminated her on August 15. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of Defense</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 11 (2007) (the phrase "current continuous service" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) means a period of service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in federal civilian employment of a workday). Her prior service appears to have ended in 2005 and thus was not current service. She has not alleged that she had any federal service between 2005 and May 12, 2008. Thus, it is clear that she was not an employee with a right to appeal under subsection (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question remains whether the appellant meets the definition of "employee" at subsection (i), i.e., an individual who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment. The administrative judge found that the appellant was serving a probationary period and that the agency's regulations[1] provide for a new probationary period when appointed to a position under the National Security Personnel System (NSPS). The appellant argues on petition for review that she completed her probationary period under her initial appointment prior to her appointment to the position with the FDIC and was not required to serve another probationary period.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that it acted within its authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 9901.512 and 9901.516 in imposing a probationary period on the appellant, whose position was covered by the NSPS. Congress enacted legislation authorizing the agency to establish by regulation and "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of [part III of Title 5]," a human resources management system, i.e., the NSPS. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902. The statute listed various sections of Title 5 that the agency could not waive.[3] Under the statute as originally enacted, there was no limitation on the agency's authority to waive chapter 75. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(h), the agency had the authority to establish an appeals process for employees who are under the NSPS and to issue regulations to implement the appeals process. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(h)(1)-(2). The statute provided that an employee against whom an adverse action was taken who "is not serving under probationary period as defined by regulations established under paragraph (2)" had certain rights to have the full Board review a final decision resulting from the appeals process established by the agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(h)(4). Pursuant to its statutory authority, the agency issued regulations that "waive or modify various statutory provisions that would otherwise be applicable to affected [agency] employees." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.101(a). Under the regulations, an "initial probationary period" is defined as "the period of time...immediately following an employee's appointment, during which an authorized management official determines whether the employee fulfills the requirements of the position to which assigned." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.103 (2008). The regulations further provide that the agency may establish initial probationary periods of at least a year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.512(a) (2008). Section 9901.516 of 5 C.F.R. (2008), Internal Placement, provides that the agency "may prescribe implementing issuances regarding...reinstatement...of individuals or employees into or within NSPS." The agency promulgated implementing issuances pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.512 (2008) to prescribe the conditions for the probationary period. Under the Department of Defense Civilian Personnel Manual, SC1950.5.2.1.4, <span class="Italic">Reappointment to Federal Service</span> (Apr. 28, 2006 edition), a person who has not successfully completed an initial NSPS probation period is required to complete a new probationary period if appointed or reappointed to an NSPS position. Subpart G of 5 C.F.R. Part 9901 (2008) sets forth the procedures for taking an adverse action against an employee, but excludes an action taken against an employee during an initial probationary period established under section 9901.512(a). Employees covered by Subpart G are also covered by Subpart H, providing for appeal rights to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.805(a) (2008). The agency relies on these statutory and regulatory provisions to argue that the appellant was serving a probationary period in her initial NSPS appointment and that she therefore has no right to appeal her termination to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;These include sections 2301, portions of section 2302, subparts A, B, E, G, and H of Title 5, Part III, and chapters 41, 45, 47, 55 (with some exception not here relevant), 57, 59, 71, 72, 73, 79, and 99. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(b)(3), (d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency fails to acknowledge, however, that Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902 effective January 28, 2008, <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the appellant's appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, &#x00A7; 1106, 122 Stat. 3, 351, 356 (2008). Under the statute as amended, the agency retains the authority to "establish, and from time to time adjust, a human resources management system for some or all of the organizational or functional units of the [agency]," but that authority was limited by the amendment so that the system could no longer waive 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 (among other provisions). Pub. L. No. 110-181, &#x00A7; 1106(a). The amendments to section 9902 further provide that "[a]ny rules and implementing issuances that were adopted prior to the date of the enactment of this Act shall be invalid to the extent that they are inconsistent with the requirements of section 9902 of title 5, United States Code, as amended by this section." Pub. L. No. 110-181, &#x00A7; 1106(b)(3). The provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(h), establishing procedures for appealing adverse actions, are no longer part of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902. As a result of these amendments, the agency's regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 9901, Subpart G, Adverse Actions, and Subpart H, Appeals, became invalid as of January 28, 2008. We also note that, after the appellant's appointment and termination, but "[b]ased on the changes" made by Pub. L. No. 110-181 prior to her appointment, the agency "delete[d]" Subpart E of 5 C.F.R. Part 9901, the purported authority under which the appellant was required to serve NSPS probation. 73 Fed. Reg. 56,346 (daily ed. Sept. 26, 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, it does not appear that the NSPS regulations upon which the agency relied in requiring the appellant to serve probation can be given effect, inasmuch as those regulations appear to limit the appellant's adverse action appeal rights. Under government-wide regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a), the first year of service of an employee who is given a career or career-conditional appointment is a probationary period when the employee was appointed from a competitive list of eligibles pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.301. The first year of service is also a probationary period when the employee "was reinstated under subpart D of this part <span class="Italic">unless</span> during any period of service which affords a current basis for reinstatement, the employee completed a probationary period or served with competitive status under an appointment which did not require a probationary period." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(2) (emphasis supplied). If the appellant's 2008 appointment met the criteria of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(2), then the appellant apparently was an "employee" with adverse action appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) when the agency terminated her appointment. Nevertheless, the record has not been developed with the above-described issues in mind, so we cannot resolve them at this stage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_107"></span>Should the agency erroneously record the hiring action as a reinstatement and soon correct the SF-50 to show appointment from a register requiring completion of a probationary period, the employee has no Board appeal rights and she has no basis for complaining of harmful error or procedural irregularities as to her removal during the first year of service. <span class="Italic">Rhinehart v. DHEW</span>, 4 MSPR 104, 105, 4 MSPB 190 (1980). The Federal Circuit added, <span class="Italic">Poores v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3273):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Poores' evidence proves at most that there is conflicting information recorded in the SF-50s. We have held that an erroneous notation on an initial SF-50 may be corrected by the Agency at a later date, even when that alteration changes the employee's probationary status and that employee is later terminated as a probationer. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 775-776 (Fed. Cir. 1984).... Further, we note that the SF-50 was expeditiously corrected on October 6, 1988 to reflect that Poores was a direct hire and that the hiring supervisor testified that he initially hired Poores as a direct hire, not as a transfer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, Poores alleges that even if she were hired as a direct hire, she justifiably believed that she was not a probationer and that the Government is estopped from proving that the original appointment forms were in error. <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span> supports this general proposition: "While we hold that the SF-50 is not legally binding, we note that the Government may not be free in all circumstances to elude the effects of its own errors." <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span>, 729 F.2d at 776. Nonetheless, Poores' argument founders on the fact that what she relied upon was a lack of information from the Agency. She was not provided with an incorrect SF-50, as was the employee in <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span>. Although she points to a "Form 1790" (Request for Character or Security Investigation) which bears a check mark in the "No probationary period involved" box, she does not allege awareness of this document prior to her termination. Nor does she allege that any Agency representative made incorrect oral representations regarding her probationary status. Her allegation that she was told she was "hired via the internal announcement" does not negate the Agency's use of its direct hire authority. Whereas her misunderstanding is understandable, it is not actionable.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a), an agency may appoint a former employee who previously acquired career status to the competitive service via reinstatement. There is no time limit on the eligibility for reinstatement for a former employee who has fully completed the service requirements for career tenure. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(b). A person who previously acquired career status is reinstated with career status. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.402(b). However, "Career tenure is acquired only under a permanent appointment in the competitive service that provides or leads to competitive status." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.201(b)(2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleged, and the administrative judge found, that the agency hired the appellant from a competitive list of eligibles for a career appointment and she was required to serve a probationary period. However, here, the issue is not simply whether the appellant was selected from a register, but how she was appointed. Although the undisputed record shows that the appellant was <span class="Italic">selected</span> from a competitive merit promotion certificate of eligibles, the agency had the discretion to <span class="Italic">appoint</span> the appellant by noncompetitive reinstatement regardless of how she was selected. <span class="Italic">See Rhinehart v.

Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(b)(2), an individual need not complete a probationary period if they are reinstated and had previously completed a probationary period during a period of service which affords a current basis for reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See generally Abdullah v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 99, &#x00B6; 11 (2009). However, this exception does not apply to the appellant because her prior position was in the excepted service rather than the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.801(b)(2), 210.102(b)(15).

We also note that the plain language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401 is permissive rather than mandatory, i.e., 'an agency <span class="Italic">may</span> appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position a person who previously was employed under career or career-conditional appointment (or equivalent).' 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a) (emphasis added)."); <span class="Italic">Oppe' v.

This regulation is a permissive one rather than a description of an entitlement, providing that 'an agency may appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position a person who previously was employed under career or career-conditional appointment (or equivalent).' There is simply no evidence that the agency in fact appointed the appellant to the Auditor position under this authority. To the contrary, the Standard Form 50 memorializing the appellant's appointment expressly stated that she was required to complete a 1-year probationary period.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of whether the appellant was appointed through reinstatement warranted remand in <span class="Italic">Aviles-Wynkoop v. DOD</span>, DC-315H-16-0327-I-1 (NP 9/14/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may appoint by reinstatement to a competitive-service position an individual who previously was employed under a career or career-conditional appointment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801, the first year of service of an employee who is given a career or career-conditional appointment in the competitive service is a probationary period when, among other things, the employee was reinstated under subpart D (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401), unless during any period of service that affords a current basis for reinstatement, the employee completed a probationary period or served with competitive status under an appointment that did not require a probationary period. In other words, when an agency appoints an individual using reinstatement authority, the individual must serve a probationary period unless during any prior service that forms the current basis for the reinstatement, the individual completed probation or did not have to serve a probationary period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.401, 801(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not contest that the appellant was appointed to her position by reinstatement. The Standard Form 50 (SF-50) documenting her appointment reflects that she was appointed by reinstatement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401. Although "the SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights," it still can be considered as evidence when determining the nature of an action. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Department of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In sum, because the parties agree that the appellant was appointed by reinstatement and the record supports that conclusion, she is subject to the regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(2) regarding probationary periods for individuals appointed through reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review, as she did below, that she previously completed a probationary period during a period affording a current basis for her reinstatement and, therefore, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.401 and 315.801(a)(2), she was not required to serve a probationary period with the agency. The administrative judge did not address this argument, instead conducting an analysis under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b) to determine if the appellant's prior service could be "tacked" to her more recent agency service to find that she completed her current probationary period for jurisdictional purposes. However, any "tacking" analysis would be irrelevant if the appellant was not required to serve a probationary period with the agency because she completed a probationary period during a period affording a current basis for her reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board addressed a situation similar to that presented by this appeal in <span class="Italic">Abdullah v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 99 (2009). The agency in that appeal terminated the appellant during what it believed was his probationary period, but the Board noted that the appellant might have been appointed to his position through reinstatement and, if that were the case and he met the criteria of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(a)(2), then he met the statutory definition of an employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13. Because the record had not been developed regarding these issues, the Board in <span class="Italic">Abdullah</span> remanded the appeal to further develop the record. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record is also not adequately developed to address the appellant's arguments. Therefore, we remand this appeal to the administrative judge to take additional evidence and argument regarding the nature of the appellant's appointment with the agency, <span id="Page_108"></span>what prior appointment(s) served as a basis for the appellant's reinstatement, and whether she completed a probationary period during the appointment(s). The administrative judge shall afford the appellant a hearing on these jurisdictional issues.</p>
