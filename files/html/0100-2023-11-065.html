<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-66"><span class="space">3.</span> Information Requested to Monitor Disciplinary Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Information concerning the disciplinary separations of two employees was properly denied when the union did not know their identities and was not asked to represent them. <span class="Italic">AAFES, Ft. Carson and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 17 FLRA 624, 629 (1985), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360 (D.C. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, 25 FLRA 1060 (1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>. On appeal, the court decided that the information requested was necessary under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), but the court left to FLRA whether disclosure would violate the Privacy Act, 793 F.2d at 1363-65:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's principal explanation for upholding management's refusal to furnish information was that the Union did not know the identities of the discharged employees and had not been asked to represent them in pressing a grievance. The Authority concluded that, under these circumstances, the Union had no "representational function" to perform. We find the FLRA's decision to be wholly without basis in law, and, in addition, a somewhat extraordinary interpretation of the Labor Statute when considered in light of the Union's legal responsibility to fairly represent all employees in the bargaining unit. It seems patently obvious, and beyond the slightest doubt, that information regarding the disciplinary dismissal of unit employees is "necessary" for a Union to fulfill its obligations as the employees' exclusive bargaining agent. We cannot comprehend the Authority's suggestion to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The relevance of the requested data is considered on a case-by-case basis; however, the employer's duty to provide the information must be evaluated in the context of the <span class="Italic">full range</span> of union responsibilities in both the negotiation and administration of a labor agreement. These principles have clear application in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union represents potentially aggrieved employees. It is well-settled that section 7114 creates a duty to provide information that would enable the Union to process a grievance or to determine whether or not to file a grievance. In addition, the Union is entitled to information relevant to its obligation to represent a unit employee subject to disciplinary treatment. In order to fulfill this obligation, it is axiomatic that the Union must be able to inform employees of the procedures to which they are entitled and to communicate its willingness to enforce compliance with the bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union represents <span class="Italic">all</span> the members of the bargaining unit. Often a policy established in connection with a particular personnel action may affect employees beyond those immediately involved. Thus, even if the Union chooses not to pursue a particular grievance, the statute creates a duty for the Agency to provide information that is relevant to the Union's need to understand new policies or the application of old policies that may affect members of the bargaining unit....&#8197;In addition, the circumstances surrounding disciplinary actions may also be relevant to bargaining proposals in future negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Union has a legitimate concern with its own status as the exclusive bargaining representative. It is entitled to information when the Agency takes an action that affects its role as exclusive representative. The Union cannot fulfill its obligation to fully represent all employees in the unit if it lacks information necessary to assess its representational responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances of this case, the Union's request for "all written data" was descriptive enough to indicate what it had in mind and to make plain the relevance of the information under the statute. Two unit employees had been discharged; in that context, there was no need for further justification of the request.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the remand decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345</span>, 25 FLRA 1060, 1062-63 (1987), FLRA applied a now outmoded Privacy Act analysis and required disclosure of information pertaining to the discipline of the two unit employees not represented by the union in appeals procedures. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 52 FLRA 1323, 1333-34 (1997) (affirming right of union to information when it presents an oral reply, whether or not union is required by law to provide representation); <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 2403</span>, 40 FLRA 1116, 1121-22 (1991), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ruling on a broader issue, FLRA determined to be negotiable a proposal that disciplinary decision letters be routinely provided to the union, without redaction of names, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 237 and USDA, Food and Nutrition Serv.</span>, 32 FLRA 62, 68-69, 71 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue is whether the release of name-identified decision letters to the Union...is negotiable. The Agency argues that the release of name-identified decision letters is outside the duty to bargain because the <span id="Page_325"></span>release (1) is prohibited by Privacy Act; (2) would apply regardless of whether the Union represents the employee; and (3) has not been shown to be relevant and necessary under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. For the following reasons, we reject these arguments and conclude that Provisions 9 and 10 are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The duty to bargain under the Statute extends to the release and disclosure of information concerning the conditions of unit employees to the extent that the release or disclosure is not contrary to law or regulation....&#8197;Clearly, the information concerning disciplinary and adverse actions concerns the conditions of employment of unit employees. In addition, we find that the release of the decision letters (1) is within the duty to bargain without regard to whether the information is relevant and necessary under section 7114(b)(4) or whether the Union represents the affected employee, and (2) does not conflict with the Privacy act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In negotiability cases concerning the release of information, section 7114(b)(4) has been identified as a statutory "floor," not a "ceiling."...&#8197;Section 7114(b)(4) establishes the minimum information which must be disclosed to a union. Nothing in section 7114(b)(4) prevents a union from negotiating with an agency for the release of information concerning the conditions of employment of unit employees beyond that which the union is entitled to under the Statute....&#8197;Thus, contrary to the Agency's argument, the information...does not need to be relevant and necessary in order for the provisions to be negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, however, that the court in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1363-64 (D.C. Cir. 1986), concluded that all the data relating to the removal of two bargaining unit employees were clearly necessary for and relevant to the representational functions of the union. The court recognized that an exclusive representative has greater responsibilities than merely processing individual employee grievances....&#8197;[T]he union must be provided with information germane to the administration of the collective bargaining agreement and to future negotiations....&#8197;The union institutionally must also have information that affects its role as exclusive representative in order to properly assess its representational responsibilities....&#8197;The court concluded that in view of these broad responsibilities, the fact that an individual employee who has been disciplined may decline union representation did not require a conclusion that the union was not entitled to the information concerning the disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Union has specifically recognized its obligations as an exclusive representative in protecting this information from any wider dissemination than is necessary to perform its representational functions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that information in disciplinary and adverse action letters may be stigmatizing to the affected employee.&#x2003;However, the public interest in disclosure of this information to the Union is compelling....&#8197;[T]he exclusive representative serves to ensure that Federal agencies observe statutory, regulatory, and collective bargaining agreement procedures in disciplining and removing employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the public's interest in ensuring that Federal agencies comply with their responsibilities in disciplining and removing employees outweighs an individual employee's privacy interests....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 37 FLRA 1346, 1364 (1990), reached a result contrary to <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, concluding that employee privacy interests outweighed their representative's interests in unredacted and otherwise unrestricted disclosure of information pertaining to disciplinary and adverse actions. <span class="Italic">INS</span> is discussed below concerning protection of employees' privacy interests.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another case involved a request, for quite a different purpose, concerning discipline meted out to a manager. The union pursued a grievance complaining that a manager used physical force against a unit employee. The grievance requested, among other things, discipline against the manager. As the grievance was about to go to arbitration, management stated that some action was taken to correct the situation. The union filed a request for any information relating to discipline against the supervisor. Management refused to supply the information, contending that because the remedy requested by the union was not available in arbitration, the information requested was not relevant to the grievance. The union's response was that it needed the information both to determine whether to pursue the case to arbitration and to prepare for arbitration. Management's failure to provide the information was a ULP, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 38 FLRA 410, 421 (1990), discussed below concerning privacy interests.</p>
<p class="noindent">An investigative report should have been supplied to the union requesting it to determine actions taken, including discipline of managers, based on bargaining unit members' complaints of unethical or illegal practices by managers involving an agency program. The decision also determined that Privacy Act objections did not bar release of the information, including identities of agency officials, given the public importance of the matters under investigation, <span class="Italic">VAMC Decatur and NFFE Local 2101</span>, 71 FLRA 428, 428-32 (2019):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The following facts are undisputed.&#x2003;The Agency administers the Housing and Urban Development Veterans Affairs Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program, which provides vouchers to help veterans obtain housing. Social workers at the Agency manage the veterans' cases. There are between 350 and 400 social workers in the bargaining unit, which includes approximately 1,200 professionals overall. The HUD-VASH program operates within the Healthcare for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Between 2013 and 2015, social workers in the bargaining unit came to the Union with complaints that HUD-VASH management were engaging in bullying, intimidation, retaliation, and fraud. These concerns came to a head in August 2015, when the director of HUD-VASH instructed social workers not to discharge veterans in the program until October 1, 2015, even though veterans were normally discharged within twenty-four hours. The delayed discharge would have artificially improved performance metrics at HUD-VASH, but many social workers feared that the directive was unethical, if not fraudulent, and that following the directive would put their own licenses at risk.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After receiving complaints from employees and the Union concerning these allegations, the Agency convened an administrative investigation board (AIB or the Board) to investigate whether management was engaging in fraud, bullying, and harassment. The role of the AIB was to hear testimony and make findings and recommendations to the Agency. The AIB could recommend that employees be disciplined for misconduct, and the Agency could use the AIB's recommendations as a basis for imposing discipline on employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AIB held a hearing in April 2016.&#x2003;The Union vice-president and other bargaining unit employees testified. The Union president took his own notes at the hearing and served as union representative for several of the bargaining unit employees who also testified. On May 23, 2016, AIB issued its Report of Investigation (the AIB report) to the Agency. Ultimately, two management officials were disciplined based on the AIB findings and recommendations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following the AIB proceedings, the Union received several inquiries from bargaining unit employees complaining that they were still being harassed after the AIB proceedings concluded. On March 9, 2017, the Union submitted an information request to the Agency. The Union requested (1) a copy of the AIB decision letter; (2) a transcript of the AIB proceeding; and (3) the recommendation made by the AIB Committee. Regarding the need for the information, the Union explained, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This information is necessary to evaluate the actions and/or inactions of the Agency in complying with law, rule, regulation, and contractual requirement. Specifically, the information may be necessary to defend employees represented by the union from potential discipline based on bullying, intimidation, harassment, fraud or other harassment. Conversely, the information may show that the Union need[s] to file a grievance against management based on harassment by agency managers or failure to prevent bullying, intimidation and harassment. The information will be used to determine if a grievance and/or other legal remedy is required to protect the rights of bargaining unit employees and/or the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union requested that the information be provided in unredacted form "since such disclosure is clearly defined as serving the public interest" and that the Union needed it "to understand what employees may have committed violations so as to properly defend them or allege violations by particular managers."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues, broadly, that the Union's articulation of its particularized need failed to establish that the information was required. The Agency notes that the Union president conceded at the hearing that there is no collective bargaining agreement provision or Agency policy that entitled him to the AIB documents.[30] Because the Agency merely reargues its case, we are unpersuaded that the ALJ erred in his application of Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, we note that the Agency's obligation to provide the requested information derives from &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, and so, whether the release of that information was also required under the collective-bargaining agreement or Agency policy is of no consequence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that in order to demonstrate that requested information is "necessary" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), the union must establish a "particularized need" by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, and how its use of the information relates to the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute.[31]</p>

As appropriate under the circumstances of the case, the agency must either furnish <span id="Page_326"></span>the information, ask for clarification of the request, identify its countervailing or other anti-disclosure interests, or inform the union that the information requested does not exist or is not maintained by the agency. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 55 FLRA 254, 260 (1999) (Chairman Segal concurring); <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md</span>., 39 FLRA 650, 656 (1991). The agency must explain its anti-disclosure interests in more than a conclusory way, and the agency must raise these interests at or near the time of the request. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 64 FLRA 293, 295-96 (2009) (<span class="Italic">SSA I</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that the union establishes a particularized need where it states that it needs the information: (1) to assess whether to file a grievance; (2) in connection with a pending grievance; (3) to determine how to support and pursue a grievance; or (4) to assess whether to arbitrate or settle a pending grievance.[32] The union's explanation must be more than a conclusory assertion and must permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the Statute requires the agency to furnish the information.[33] However, "a union's request for information 'need not be so specific' as 'to reveal its strategies.'"[34] In many cases, a union will not be aware of the contents of a requested document, and the degree of specificity required of a union must take that into account.[35] Further, a union's right to information is not dependent on whether the information is reasonably available from an alternative source.[36]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We reject the argument that a union has failed to articulate its need with requisite specificity, where, as here, the information request referenced a specific agency action and specified that the union needed the information to assess: (1) whether the agency violated established policies, and (2) whether to file a grievance, even though the union did not explain exactly how the information would enable it to determine whether to file a grievance.[37] The Authority has emphasized that such information is necessary because arbitration can function properly only when the grievance procedures leading to it are able to sift out unmeritorious grievances.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the requests for the AIB documents occurred more than one year after the conclusion of the investigation and that no bargaining unit employees were disciplined as a result of the AIB proceedings.&#x2003;However, as the Judge correctly determined, the Union articulated a particularized need to assess the risk of "potential" discipline and to determine whether to file a grievance, regardless of whether disciplinary action was ultimately taken and regardless of whether grievances were ultimately filed.[40] Whether the requested information would have in fact accomplished the Union's purpose is not determinative of whether the information is necessary within the meaning of the Statute.[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency has not shown that the Judge erred by concluding that the Union established a particularized need for the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B. <span class="Italic">The Judge correctly found that the unredacted disclosure of the requested information is not barred by the Privacy Act.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also challenged the unredacted release of the requested information as prohibited by the Privacy Act.[42]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[42] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a; Exceptions at 14-16. The Privacy Act generally prohibits the disclosure of information concerning Federal employees without their consent, unless, as relevant here, disclosure of the record would be required under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, N.Y. TRACON, Westbury, N.Y</span>., 50 FLRA 338, 345 (1995) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). FOIA broadly requires the disclosure of government records but exempts certain categories of information including, as relevant here, "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6) (also known as "Exemption 6"); <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., Wash., D.C</span>., 69 FLRA 323, 327 (2016). The Agency has not invoked any other FOIA exemption. If such an invasion would result, then disclosure is not required by FOIA. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex</span>., 60 FLRA 261, 275 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency asserting that the Privacy Act bars disclosure must demonstrate: (1) that the information sought is contained in a system of records within the meaning of the Privacy Act; (2) that disclosure would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests.[43] If an agency meets its burden of proof, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to (1) identify a public interest cognizable under FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how disclosure of the requested information will serve the public interest.[44] In this context, the only relevant public interest to be considered is the extent to which the requested disclosure "would she[d] light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties," or otherwise inform citizens "what their government is up to."[45]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43] <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 345. Here, it is undisputed that the information originally requested by the Union is contained in a system of records. The Union also concedes that the requested information implicates significant employee privacy interests, including those of the management officials who were disciplined pursuant to the AIB findings and recommendations, as well as AIB witnesses who could fear retaliation if their identities were revealed. Judge's Decision at 21; GC Opp'n Br. at 11; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of VA, VA Med.

<p class="noindent-1">If the agency and the General Counsel meet their respective burdens, the Authority balances the privacy interests of the employees against the public interest in disclosure.[46] When privacy interests outweigh the public interest, the Authority finds that disclosure of the requested information would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and is therefore exempt from FOIA reporting requirements.[47] And unless disclosure is permitted under another exception to the Privacy Act, which has not been alleged in this case, the Authority concludes that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of the information and that furnishing the information is prohibited by law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute.[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency concedes that the public has an interest in learning whether management officials engaged in fraud, abuse, or other serious misconduct. The Agency nonetheless disputes that disclosure of the full, unredacted AIB materials would enhance the public interest. According to the Agency, providing the Union with the identities of the individuals who were disciplined "only benefits an interest specific to the Union." However, considering the nature and scope of the wrongdoing at issue, as well as the fact that the disciplined employees were management officials, we discern no error in the Judge's finding that identification of those individuals would "further the public interest in ensuring that 'disciplinary measures imposed are adequate, and that those who are accountable are dealt with in an appropriate manner.'"[51] The Agency's bare assertion that it "took appropriate discipline against the managers who were recommended discipline" is insufficient to serve that purpose. Moreover, the Agency has not contested the Judge's finding that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interests at stake in this case.</p>
