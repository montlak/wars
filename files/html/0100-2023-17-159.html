<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-157"><span class="space">5.</span> Allegations of Bias</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 35 FLRA 421, 427 (1990), established the nature of the circumstances necessary to have an award overturned for bias:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to show that an arbitrator was biased against a party to a proceeding, the party must substantiate that: (1) the arbitrator's award was procured by improper means; (2) there was partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrator; or (3) the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct by which the rights of any party were prejudiced. <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration, Winston-Salem, N.C. and American Federation of Government Employees Local 2880</span>, 27 FLRA 44 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3979 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Sheridan</span>, 61 FLRA 810, 813 (2006), elaborated on the elements of bias:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an arbitration award deficient when the appealing party establishes that there was bias, partiality, or corruption on the part of the arbitrator. To establish that an award is deficient on this ground, the appealing party must demonstrate one of the following: (1) the award was procured by improper means; (2) there was partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrator; or (3) the arbitrator engaged in misconduct that prejudiced the rights of the appealing party. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Ann Arbor, Mich., </span>56 FLRA 216, 220 (2000)<span class="Italic"> (citing Department of the Army, Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) and Fort Campbell, Fort Campbell, Ky.</span>, 7 FLRA 18, 19 (1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When analyzing a bias allegation, the Authority has applied the approach of Federal courts in reviewing awards in the private sector. In <span class="Italic">National Gallery of Art</span>, 39 FLRA 226, 233-234 (1991), the Authority noted that when a claim of partiality is made, Federal courts require the appealing party to prove specific facts establishing improper motives; the courts ascertain from such record as is available whether the arbitrator's conduct was so biased and prejudiced as to destroy fundamental fairness. Federal courts will find bias or evident partiality when: (1) a reasonable person would conclude that the arbitrator was partial; (2) the circumstances are powerfully suggestive of bias; or (3) the evidence of impropriety is direct, definite, and capable of demonstration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 233-34. When possible, claims of "personal bias" must be raised to the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See United States Envtl. Prot. Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Ill</span>., 61 FLRA 247, 250 n.3 (2005); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md</span>. 57 FLRA 417, 422 (2001); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Hill AFB, Utah</span>, 34 FLRA 986, 990 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the standard set forth above to the facts of this case, we conclude that the Union has not established that the Arbitrator was biased in the conduct of the hearing or in his award. We note, in this regard, that the Union asserts, and the Agency does not dispute, that the Union raised its bias concerns directly to the Arbitrator at the hearing. Nevertheless, the Union's bias exceptions are bare assertions that do not establish that the Arbitrator's conduct was biased or partial, and constitute an attempt to relitigate the matter before the Authority. Such an exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Def., Def. Commissary Agency, Pearl Harbor, Haw.</span>, 48 FLRA 476, 479 (1993). Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The allegation of bias must be raised before the arbitrator, when possible, <span class="Italic">EPA Region 5 and AFGE Local 704</span>, 61 FLRA 247, 250 n.3 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Union's assertion that the Agency was required to raise its bias claims before the Arbitrator.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator was biased.&#x2003;To establish that an award is deficient because of bias on the part of the arbitrator, a party must show that an award was procured by improper means, that the arbitrator was partial or corrupt, or that the arbitrator engaged in misconduct that prejudiced the parties' rights. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local RI-109, </span>58 FLRA 501, 504 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., N. Chi., Ill.,</span> 52 FLRA 387, 398 (1996)). In addition, a party's assertion that all of an arbitrator's findings were adverse to that party, without more, does not demonstrate that an arbitrator was biased. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C.,</span> 56 FLRA 381, 384 (2000) (<span class="Italic">RHJ Med. Ctr</span>.). Finally, issues involving arbitrator conduct at the hearing should be raised at the hearing. When they could have been, but were not raised before the arbitrator, such issues will not be considered for the first time on review of an award unless exceptional circumstances are present. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md,</span> 57 FLRA 417, 422 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Indian Head</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union contends that the Arbitrator's failure to find the <span id="page_1935"></span>Agency in violation of the agreement is an indication of bias, the Union does not allege that the Agency procured the award by improper means. Moreover, the Union's dispute with arbitral findings in favor of the Agency does not, by itself, demonstrate that the Arbitrator was "partial or corrupt, or that the arbitrator engaged in misconduct that prejudiced the parties' rights." <span class="Italic">See RHJ Med. Ctr.,</span> 56 FLRA at 384.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Arbitrator's alleged reference to the feelings of his "Mexican friend" during arbitration, even assuming that the Union's assertion is accurate, the Union admits that it did not raise before the Arbitrator any issues involving the alleged reference. Although the Union asserts that it feared an adverse response from the Arbitrator, we find that such unsubstantiated fears do not constitute exceptional circumstances that would excuse the Union's failure to address this matter before the Arbitrator. We therefore decline to consider the Union's exception to these alleged remarks. <span class="Italic">See Indian Head,</span> 57 FLRA at 422.</p>
<p class="noindent">Admission of evidence would not ordinarily demonstrate bias by an arbitrator, <span class="Italic">VA Central Arkansas Healthcare System and AFGE Local 2054</span>, 71 FLRA 593, 594 (2020):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator was biased because he admitted testimony and evidence over the objections of the Agency's counsel. The Authority will find that an arbitrator is biased where the excepting party demonstrates that there was partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrator.[13] Therefore, an agency's identification of several arbitral determinations that did not favor it does not, by itself, show bias.[14] An arbitrator also has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing.[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously held that an arbitrator's liberal admission of testimony and evidence is permissible.[16] Additionally, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's admission of the disputed evidence prevented the Agency from presenting its case in full to the Arbitrator or otherwise affected the fairness of the proceeding.[17] Rather, the Agency claims that it was prejudiced by the mere admission of evidence and testimony. Because the record demonstrates that the Arbitrator impartially permitted testimony and evidence from both parties, we deny this exception.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Because the remedial award was based on the Arbitrator's consideration of briefs and documentary evidence, rather than in-person testimony, the Union raises several exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator exhibited bias by declining to (1) hold a hearing, and (2) "compel the [A]gency to supply all of the information the [U]nion requested." The Union argues that these decisions by the Arbitrator deprived the Union of the opportunity to challenge the Agency's evidence or present evidence of its own. Although the Union disagrees with these decisions, they concern the form and content of the arbitration process. The Authority has held that arbitrators have considerable latitude in managing arbitration proceedings.[58] Therefore, these decisions alone do not establish bias through improper means, partiality, or misconduct.[59]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of VA, Cent. Ark. Veterans Healthcare Sys. Cent</span>., 71 FLRA 593, 594 (2020) (then-Member DuBester concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Chapter 299</span>, 68 FLRA at 839.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also alleges that the Arbitrator was biased in issuing an award based largely on evidence provided by the Agency. This allegation is based on the Union's disagreement with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence, which the Authority has found insufficient to establish bias.[61] Therefore, we deny the Union's bias exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[61]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, Loc. 3911, AFL-CIO</span>, 68 FLRA 564, 571 (2015) (finding exception that merely disagreed with the arbitrator's evaluation of witness credibility, analysis of documents, and conclusions "fail[ed] to demonstrate any bias on the part of the [a]rbitrator").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the same reasons that the Union argues the Arbitrator exhibited bias, the Union also argues that the remedial award is incomplete. To establish that an award is deficient because it is incomplete, the excepting party must demonstrate that the award is impossible to implement because the meaning and effect of the award are too unclear or uncertain.[63] Because the Union fails to argue, let alone demonstrate, that the remedial award would be impossible to implement due to a lack of clarity or certainty, we also deny this exception.[64]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[64]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also asserts that the award was based on nonfacts.[65] Specifically, the Union contends that the award is based on unverified and noncredible evidence because the Arbitrator did not allow evidence or witnesses to be examined at a hearing. But, as this nonfact exception challenges the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence, it provides no basis for finding the award deficient.[67] Therefore, we deny the Union's nonfact exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[65]&#x2003;To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the excepting party must show that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Loc. 1594</span>, 71 FLRA 878, 880 (2020).</p>

<p class="noindent">Finally, the Union alleges that the Arbitrator denied the Union a fair hearing[68] because, without a hearing, it was unable to rebut the evidence submitted by the Agency. However, the record indicates that the Union had one month after receiving the Agency's brief and documentary evidence to submit its own, which allowed the Union the opportunity to counter the Agency's positions. As the Union has not established that the Arbitrator refused to hear or consider any pertinent evidence, we find that it has not established that the arbitral proceedings were unfair.[72]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[68]&#x2003;The Authority will find that an arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing where a party demonstrates that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence or conducted the proceedings in a manner that so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceedings as a whole. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Loc. 3369</span>, 72 FLRA 158, 160 (2021)</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union maintains that the award was "procured...by improper means" and that the Arbitrator showed "partiality to the Agency." In support of these claims, the Union points to several of the Arbitrator's procedural decisions relating to motions. These decisions include giving the Union one day to respond to the Agency's hearing motion; failing to rule on the hearing motion; directing the Agency to file a motion for summary judgment; extending the filing deadline when the Agency twice failed to file the motion; and erroneously finding that the Union declined to participate in the summary judgment proceedings. As additional evidence of arbitral bias, the Union cites the Arbitrator's failure to respond to the Union's emails and <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> emails between the Arbitrator and the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, to establish that an award was improperly procured, a party must show that the award was the result of "corruption, fraud, or [other] undue means."[38] Here, the Union challenges procedural matters over which the Arbitrator exercised discretion, such as ruling on motions, establishing deadlines, and communicating with the parties.[39] Although the Union strongly disagrees with the Arbitrator's decisions on these matters, it has not presented any arguments or evidence that they were the result of corruption, fraud, or impropriety by the Arbitrator.[40] Therefore, we find that the Union has not established that the award was procured by improper means.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In support of this exception, the Agency submitted affidavits to support its assertion that the Arbitrator had misrepresented the Agency's position. The Union asserts that the Authority should not consider these affidavits. However, because the affidavits constitute support for the Agency's contention that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator was biased, they could not have been submitted to the Arbitrator prior to issuance of the award. Therefore, their use is not precluded by section 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, El Paso, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council, Local 1929</span>, 40 FLRA 43, 52 (1991). Accordingly, in resolving the exception, we have considered the Agency's affidavits.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA denies bias exceptions based on statements by an arbitrator that are critical of a party or remarks by an arbitrator indicating concern with a party's conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Indian Head Div. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-141.html">56 FLRA 848</a>, 851 (2000). Expressions of strong opinion in an award do not prove bias, <span class="Italic">VAMC, Ann Arbor and AFGE Local 2092</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-026.html">56 FLRA 216</a>, 221 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As concerns the Agency's allegation that various statements in the Arbitrator's decision illustrate his bias, we note that the record does show that the Arbitrator viewed the Agency's approach to defending this case to be inadequate. For example, as the Agency points out, at the outset of his decision, the Arbitrator observes that "the Agency seems to have been consumed with total indignation that these proceedings have been instituted and begun." The Arbitrator then states that he is "quite puzzl[ed] and amaz[ed] why the Agency has declined and/or avoided...the opportunity to present a defense through competent witnesses[.]" At another point in the decision, the Arbitrator states, "[e]xcept for the cross-examination of the Union's two expert witnesses which essentially failed to disturb their highly impressive testimony and observations, the Agency has disregarded the need to have had testimony in support of its overall and general position which would resist and reject the Union's presentations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency, when viewed in totality, these statements are simply indicative of the Arbitrator's dissatisfaction with the Agency's defense strategy. They do not, however, establish that the Arbitrator was biased or partial under any of the tests applied by the Authority or the Federal courts in private sector labor cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 4042 and U.S. Department of Defense, Army Air Force Exchange Service, Waco Distribution Center, Waco, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1709, 1714 (1996) (finding that arbitrator's opinion, sharply critical of the union's actions, failed to establish that the arbitrator was biased). In these circumstances, we conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated any impropriety by the Arbitrator that destroyed the fundamental fairness of the arbitration proceedings. As such, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Pope Air Force Base, and AFGE Local 1770</span> (<span class="Italic">Union</span>) 71 FLRA 338, 341 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring), dismissed a bias challenge:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator exhibited bias "because the Agency chose to exercise its right to defend its clients and not capitulate to the Union's settlement demands." In particular, the Agency cites the Arbitrator's statement that "a significant portion of [the] Union's incurred fees were largely due to the Agency's ongoing bad faith and refusal to cooperate in settlement discussions [and] negotiations[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's assertion, the statement in question is not a gratuitous expression of hostility, but a finding of fact directly relevant to the reasonableness of the hours expended by the Union's attorneys. The mere fact that the Arbitrator's finding favored the Union does not demonstrate bias.[40] Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the Arbitrator commented that the grievant's unscheduled leave based on an anticipated migraine was "unusual and imaginative." Although these comments were critical of the grievant, the Authority has found that similar comments, standing alone, do not establish that an arbitrator was biased.[11] Moreover, the Arbitrator did not rely on the grievant's reason for requesting leave to resolve the grievance. Therefore, these comments, as mere dicta, do not demonstrate that the award is deficient for the reasons asserted by the Union.[12] Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1938"></span>An unelaborated allegation by a party of improper contact by another party with an arbitrator is insufficient to show that the award was improperly procured. <span class="Italic">Audie Murphy VA Hosp., San Antonio and AFGE Local 3511</span>, 16 FLRA 1079, 1080 (1984). <span class="Italic">FDA, Cincinnati Dist.

<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the Arbitrator "should have disqualified himself." We find, consistent with decisions of Federal courts in private sector labor relations cases, that an arbitrator is not automatically disqualified by a social or personal relationship with someone involved in the arbitration when that relationship is fully disclosed to the parties. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Toyota of Berkeley v.

<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, contentions of prejudice or bias on the part of an arbitrator provide no basis for finding an award deficient when (1) the arbitrator fully discloses a social or personal relationship with someone involved in the arbitration and (2) the party filing the exception failed to object to the arbitrator at the time of the disclosure....</p>
