<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-112"><span class="space">2.</span> Awards of Compensatory Damages--Civil Rights Acts</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sloan v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 58, 64-65, 70-81 (1997), moved beyond discussion of jurisdiction and procedures involved in damages claims and assessed $35,000 in damages for emotional distress arising from a retaliatory demotion and events leading to it<span class="Italic">. Sloan</span> explained the determinants and proof of compensatory damages for emotional distress, depression, anxiety, and related difficulties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[E]motional distress damages must be evaluated in light of all the circumstances surrounding the alleged misconduct." <span class="Italic">Spence v. Board of Education</span>, 806 F.2d 1198, 1202 (3d Cir. 1986), citing <span class="Italic">Carey v.</span> <span class="Italic">Piphus,</span> 435 U.S. 247, 263, 98 S. Ct. 1042, 1052, 55 L. Ed.2d 252 (1978). Thus, even though only the demotion and reassignment were appealable to the Board, we will consider the pattern of activity and the length of time between the first retaliatory action and the appealable actions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OWCP found that medical evidence submitted by the appellant related her conditions of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder "to factors of her employment (the harassment and retaliation by her supervisor)." OWCP concluded that the evidence "was sufficient to show that [the appellant] sustained a medical condition due to factors of her Federal employment." OWCP accepted her case for the conditions of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, and awarded her benefits under FECA. OWCP determined that the appellant's date of injury was February 11, 1994, and it compensated her for lost wages due to the injury beginning on that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Board's final decision on the merits of this appeal, the administrative judge found that the prohibited discrimination consisted of a "series of [retaliatory] actions" taken against the appellant beginning on May 11, 1993, just four days after she informed Sherman of her intent to file a discrimination complaint against him. The administrative judge found that the discrimination culminated with the February 11, 1994 action. The appellant claims compensatory damages under Title VII based on her argument that the unlawful discrimination resulted in the major depression and generalized anxiety disorder which were accepted by OWCP as compensable under FECA. She also claims compensatory damages for emotional distress, dysfunction, weight loss, lack of sleep, and elevated blood pressure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not heretofore addressed the standard for showing entitlement to compensatory damages or the factors that enter into a determination of the amount of such damages. EEOC, however, has done so. As discussed below, we will defer to and adopt EEOC's criteria for proving both entitlement to and the amount of compensatory damages. As stated above, the appellant has claimed only nonpecuniary losses. Thus, we will limit our discussion to such losses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Non-pecuniary losses are losses that are not subject to precise quantification. <span class="Italic">See Rountree</span>, slip op. at 6. They include emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, and loss of health. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 191, 196 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4933"></span>"'[C]ompensatory damage awards must be limited to the sums necessary to compensate [the appellant] for actual harm, even if the harm is intangible.'" <span class="Italic">Rountree</span>, slip op. at 7 (citation omitted). Thus, a compensatory-damages award should reimburse an appellant for proven non-pecuniary losses while recognizing that "[t]here are no precise formulas for determining the amount of damages for nonpecuniary losses." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To receive an award of compensatory damages, an appellant must demonstrate that she has been harmed as a result of the agency's discriminatory action; the extent, nature, and severity of the harm; and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rountree,</span> slip op. at 6. An award of compensatory damages for nonpecuniary losses should reflect the extent to which the agency directly or proximately caused the harm and the extent to which other factors also caused the harm, in addition to reflecting the nature and severity of the harm and its duration or expected duration. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC referred this case to us to allow the appellant to submit objective evidence on her claim of compensatory damages.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In awarding compensatory damages, the administrative judge erroneously did not consider the medical conditions that resulted in the award of OWCP benefits to the appellant. We will now take those conditions into account in determining the amount of compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not challenge the administrative judge's finding that the appellant suffered emotional distress, anxiety, dysfunction, weight loss, lack of sleep, and elevated blood pressure as a result of the unlawful discrimination, and we discern no ground on which to disturb those findings. Thus, in measuring the amount of the appellant's non-pecuniary losses, we will address those medical conditions, as well as the conditions accepted by OWCP as being compensable under FECA, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, her major depression and generalized anxiety disorder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. D. Leonard Minisee, the appellant's internist, stated that he first treated the appellant in February 1994. At that time, he diagnosed high blood pressure and anxiety neuroses. He subsequently modified the latter diagnosis to be both depression and anxiety. Dr. Minisee opined that, based on the history given to him by the appellant, including perceived harassment by her direct supervisor, a "definite correlation" exists between her work stressors and her dysfunctions. He stated that because of her depression and anxiety, she has a "limited ability to return to full functioning." Dr. Minisee opined that the non-work-related stressors identified as occurring to the appellant before 1993 may have made her more vulnerable to the work-related stress she encountered in 1993 and 1994. A March 21, 1994 letter from Dr. Minisee to OWCP states that the appellant "has suffered significant incapacitation due to the nature of her illness," but that she "has been compliant with her follow-up recommendations, and is continuing under appropriate therapy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's psychiatrist, Dr. Trevor R. Lindsay, stated that he first saw the appellant on February 23, 1994, on a referral from Dr. Minisee, and that she then complained of being highly anxious and depressed because of harassment, discrimination, and abuse by Mr. Sherman. The appellant related to Dr. Lindsay her belief that the demotion was taken as a result of her EEO complaints. At that time, Dr. Lindsay diagnosed the appellant as having "depressive disorder and adjustment reactions with mixed emotions," a diagnosis which he revised in November of 1994 as being "major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder." He stated that at that time, the appellant was unable to sleep, unable to eat, and had lost twenty-five pounds over a period of a year. Dr. Lindsay averred that he continues to treat the appellant, seeing her at least every two weeks and sometimes at more frequent intervals. He declared that the appellant is on prescription medication for depression and anxiety. He opined that his prognosis for the appellant's recovery is "very poor," and that she "remains highly anxious, still depressed, and has suicidal thoughts."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the agency's request for information about the appellant's rehabilitation potential, Dr. Lindsay advised that she remained highly anxious, withdrawn, depressed, and "phobic at the thought of...any work-related matter." He based his assessment on the appellant's comments to him that the agency was harassing her, had humiliated and degraded her, and was trying to force her to commit suicide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Lindsay stated that the death of the appellant's husband was a "grief reaction," and that the incident did very little to aggravate her anxiety and depression. (The record evidence shows that the appellant married Donald Sloan on January 18, 1994, and that the marriage ended when Mr. Sloan died on August 1, 1994.) With regard to any problems with her "newly acquired family," Dr. Lindsay opined that any such difficulties "were just small ripples on the big mainstream of her problem with her boss, Mr. Sherman, and with her sense of harassment and unfairness by her employer." He further stated his "firm[ ]" belief that the appellant's grieving period for her late husband and her adjustment to her new family by marriage were "noncontributory" to her present mental health.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated that she saw Dr. Oscar Fadul in June 1993, and that sometime in 1993, Dr. Fadul ordered a treadmill test to ascertain the cause of her chest pains. A December 2, 1993 report from Dr. Phillip L. Laney, Cardiology Consultants of Huntsville, Alabama, shows that the appellant was complaining of "squeezing and stabbing" substernal chest pain brought on by emotional distress. The appellant reported that she never had chest pain "until she came under an extreme degree of stress at the post office." A thallium exercise test revealed no ischemia or scar.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC has determined that an agency is fully liable for the damage resulting from the prohibited discrimination even though the appellant had a pre-existing condition that made the consequences of the wrongful act more severe than they would have been absent the pre-existing condition. <span class="Italic">Wallis</span>, slip op. at 9 (citation omitted). Thus, compensatory damages may not be proportionately reduced because of a pre-existing weakness or susceptibility. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The EEOC has adopted two exceptions to this general rule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, when the appellant is incapacitated or disabled prior to the discriminatory conduct, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation that it caused. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Second, if the appellant has a pre-existing condition that would inevitably worsen, the agency causing the subsequent injury is entitled to have the award reduced to reflect the proportion of damages that would have been suffered even in the absence of the subsequent injury. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The burden in such an instance is on the agency to prove the extent of the damages that the pre-existing condition would inevitably have caused<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A March 15, 1995 report prepared by Dr. L. Edward Shehi, Jr., a psychiatrist, shows that the appellant appeared to him as "quite tearful and depressed." Dr. Shehi stated that the appellant had an "extended history of psychiatric illness," including a hospitalization in 1991 for a six-to-eight-week period when she was placed on antidepressant medication, and a depressive episode in 1971 that was severe enough to require hospitalization. (The record also contains a July 21, 1975 report from Elgin Internal Medical Associates stating that the appellant was then having family problems, was in the process of divorcing her husband, and was "complaining of nervousness [and] difficult sleeping.") Dr. Shehi diagnosed "major depression, recurrent," and he opined that it was "unlikely" that the appellant could ever again be a productive employee with the agency in light of her experiences there. With respect to the prior emotional problems, Dr. Lindsay stated that while the appellant might be at more risk to develop depression because of her history of psychiatric episodes, that does not necessarily mean she would do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence shows that, in June 1994, the appellant filed for a divorce from Mr. Sloan, who died on August 1 of that year. Christina Sloan Anderson, whose father was married to the appellant, asserted that the divorce papers indicated that Mr. Sloan had caused the appellant "a lot of mental stress and mental anguish." Anderson stated that the appellant appeared normal and her behavior consistent from late 1993 through December 1994 (the appellant married Ms. Anderson's father on January 18, 1994). Anderson acknowledged, however, that she saw the appellant only once in 1993 for about five minutes around Thanksgiving, and that she "had very little to do with her" in January and February 1994. The appellant also testified that she suffered some stress when her son was sent to prison in 1991, but that she "dealt with it."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delma F. Austin, a Human Resource Specialist in the agency's Injury Compensation Control Office in Birmingham, Alabama, stated that in November 1991 and July 1992 the appellant "requested forms to file stress claims." In a March 25, 1994 letter to OWCP, Carol M. Yarbro, the agency's Senior Injury Compensation Specialist, stated that, in November 1991 and July 1992, the appellant requested forms on which to file occupational disease claims, but that the appellant did not file a claim on either occasion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statements provided by Drs. Minisee and Lindsay show that the appellant complained in February 1994 of an emotional problem that closely followed in time the agency's discriminatory actions. Although the record evidence shows that the appellant was treated for emotional conditions in 1971, 1975, and 1991, there is no evidence establishing that those conditions continued to 1994, let alone that they would have inevitably worsened. Although Dr. Minisee did not state when the 1971, 1975, and 1991 conditions may have subsided, he opined that the appellant was "functioning normally" prior to the stress brought on by the agency's discriminatory actions. Dr. Minisee also pointed out that when he first treated the appellant in February 1994, she exhibited "significant dysfunction related to her work stressors," and that the other stressors, such as the June 1994 divorce filing and Mr. Sloan's August 1994 death, had "no bearing" on the way in which she presented in February 1994 because those events had not even happened at that time. The appellant testified that her relationship with Mr. Sloan was "real good" up through February 1993 when the agency took the last of the discriminatory actions at issue here, and that the only stress on their marriage was the stress caused by the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Lindsay opined that the other stressors in the appellant's life played a negligible part in her emotional problems. Although the agency asked Dr. Lindsay if he knew about the appellant's emotional difficulties in the mid-1970s and in 1991, it did not elicit any testimony from him as to whether, in his opinion, those episodes had continued to affect the appellant at the time of the discriminatory actions so as to contribute to her present condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Shehi stated that although the appellant had experienced three prior emotional episodes, she had subsequently "worked her way up to Postmaster in Grant, Alabama and was quite proud of her accomplishments until her experience evidently with her supervisor." Similarly, the appellant stated that the 1975 episode was a "long time ago," and that she had since returned to full-time employment and developed the relationship with Mr. Sloan that led to their eventual marriage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The testimony of the appellant and Drs. Minisee and Lindsay provide no basis on which to find that the appellant continued to suffer, in any significant way, from aftereffects of the 1971, 1975, and 1991 episodes. Further, the agency did not submit evidence that would support such a finding if it wished to have the Board find that the appellant's 1994 condition was significantly related to those three prior episodes. Thus, we find that the appellant has provided sufficient evidence showing that the major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder from which she now suffers were the result of the unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, the appellant's conditions have not incapacitated her to such an extent that she cannot function in more complex tasks such as preparing legal documents, probating an estate, and appealing in court. Nonetheless, the unrebutted evidence shows that she has been taking medication for her depression and anxiety and is expected to continue on medication for the foreseeable future; that in the opinion of Drs. Lindsay and Minisee, her prognosis for a complete recovery is poor, or at least guarded; that, in Dr. Shehi's opinion, she is unlikely to return to work for the agency because of her perceptions of the treatment she received there; that she cries, loses sleep, and has high blood pressure; and that she has not been able to return to work.[6] (Dr. Shehi stated that the appellant appeared "tearful" and complained of "problems with insomnia...Dr. Lindsay testified that the appellant was "unable to sleep" and "was tearful").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The evidence shows that the appellant has applied for a disability retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preponderant evidence therefore shows that, at the time of the hearing on compensatory damages, the appellant had been on medication and had been visiting a psychiatrist for about a year and a half. The evidence also shows, that she would be continuing this course of treatment for an indeterminate period of time, and that it was problematic when, and indeed whether, she would ever return to work with the agency or any other employer. Thus, we find that the record evidence shows that the harm caused by the illegal discrimination was more than temporary in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the evidence establishes that the discriminatory conduct has affected the appellant in several ways. It has caused mental difficulties (anxiety and depression), has affected her emotional state (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, suicidal thoughts), has manifested itself physically (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, chest pains, elevated blood pressure, and weight loss), and has led to behavioral changes (<span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> sleeplessness and tearfulness). Thus, we find that the harm is not only long term, but extensive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, in assessing the measure of compensatory damages, the agency is liable for the entire harm even though the appellant was vulnerable to developing major depression and anxiety because of past episodes of emotional distress. We have considered that, after the discriminatory actions took place, the appellant was subjected to stressors related to her decision to divorce Mr. Sloan and to his subsequent death. The agency would not be liable for any losses caused by factors other than the discrimination that caused emotional distress damages. However, the preponderant evidence of record shows that the disturbances in the appellant's personal life are negligible compared to the magnitude of the agency's discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's discriminatory conduct did not consist of a single act, but instead comprised a series of acts taking place over a ten-month period and culminating in both a demotion and a reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v. Duncan-Huggins Ltd.</span>, 727 F.2d 1225, 1238 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (it is relevant for an award of compensatory damages that the plaintiff endured "seventeen months of incessant humiliation, harassment, and feelings of isolation"). The evidence shows that the discriminatory conduct began almost immediately after the appellant informed Mr. Sherman of her intent to file an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not challenged the administrative judge's findings that the appellant suffered emotional distress, anxiety, depression, weight loss, insomnia, and elevated blood pressure as a result of the illegal discrimination. Indeed, both Dr. Lindsay and Dr. Minisee opined that the appellant's emotional distress was due to the discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652, slip op. at 5-6 (two physicians opined that the appellant's work environment caused his mental distress and associated symptoms).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is material to the issue of the nature and severity of the appellant's emotional distress that she sought expert medical help for her condition. <span class="Italic">Cf Hetzel,</span> 89 F.3d at 171 (the plaintiff had "never once seen a doctor, therapist, or other professional, or even sought the counsel of a friend, to help her deal with what is supposedly an enormous problem overshadowing all aspects of her life"). According to Dr. Lindsay, the prognosis for the appellant's recovery is very poor. Indeed, at the time of his testimony in July 1995, which was over two years since the demotion and reassignment, Dr. Lindsay was seeing the appellant frequently on a regular basis (at least every two weeks), further indicating that the emotional distress was extensive and of long duration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence also shows that the discriminatory conduct resulted in the appellant's absence from the workplace and has adversely impacted her ability to ever return to her position or even to work at any job. (Dr. Lindsay declared that the appellant was anxious and "phobic" about any work-related matter)[.] <span class="Italic">Cf. Spence,</span> 806 F.2d at 1199 (not only did the plaintiff offer no proof of physical or psychological injury, she "suffered no loss of job or reduction in pay...[; t] hus she did not suffer emotional distress resulting from lost income"). It is pertinent that the appellant experienced objective manifestations of her emotional distress, for example, chest pains, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Rakovich v. Wade,</span> 819 F.2d 1393, 1399 (7th Cir.) (a plaintiff seeking compensatory damages should produce evidence of "demonstrable emotional distress"), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds,</span> <span id="Page_4934"></span>850 F.2d 1180 (7th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. American Air Filter Co.,</span> 772 F.2d 1303, 1313-14 (7th Cir. 1985) (compensatory damages for emotional distress require that the plaintiff demonstrate some objective manifestation of his emotional distress, such as "'sleeplessness, anxiety, embarrassment, and depression'" (citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">Sinnott v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952872, slip op. at 7 (Sept. 19, 1996) (the appellant established her claim of emotional distress based on her testimony and statements from family and friends that the agency's actions caused her to suffer from nightmares and heart palpitations; that the actions detrimentally affected her marriage; and that she was apprehensive about working with males).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described in detail above, the record evidence does not indicate that the incidents of emotional distress suffered by the appellant in the 1970s and in 1991 contributed to any great extent, if at all, to her present condition. There is no evidence showing that those prior conditions persisted into 1992 and 1993 when the discriminatory conduct took place. If anything, the evidence as to those prior episodes suggests that the appellant was more prone to suffer severe emotional distress from the agency's discriminatory conduct, particularly given the duration of that conduct. (Dr. Lindsay opined that an individual who has suffered depression in the past "can be more prone" to suffer from it again).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Meadows v. Guptill</span>, 856 F. Supp. 1362, 1371 (D. Ariz. 1993) (the plaintiff was entitled to compensatory damages where the evidence showed that, after her husband's death, exposure to a hostile working environment for seventeen months "substantially aggravated" her condition); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01943844, slip op. at 11-12 (Feb. 12, 1997) (although the appellant had a history of depression since the age of 16, had experienced various stressors in her life prior to and during the period of harassment, had been in therapy prior to the period of harassment, and was particularly susceptible to the sexual harassment when it occurred, the harassment substantially aggravated the appellant's pre-existing emotional condition to such an extent that she was entitled to an award of compensatory damages).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition and as fully explained above, the testimonies of both Drs. Lindsay and Minisee show that any stress caused by the appellant's family problems (in particular, her filing for a divorce from Mr. Sloan and his subsequent death) was negligible, that her family problems had lasted only a short time (through the middle of 1994 when she had filed for the divorce and Mr. Sloan had died), that these family problems had occurred after the last of the discriminatory actions at issue here, and that they did not contribute in any significant manner to her current mental state. Thus, we find no basis on which to reduce the appellant's compensatory damages in light of those other stressors. <span class="Italic">Cf. Terrell v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961030, slip op. at 13 (Oct. 25, 1996) (in addition to the agency's discriminatory conduct, the appellant's marital problems had been ongoing for a number of years, and he had incurred a large debt; thus, it was proper to reduce the compensatory-damages award accordingly).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the appellant established that she suffers from anxiety and depression; that her emotional distress has manifested itself in symptoms such as chest pains, sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, and elevated blood pressure; that the emotional distress was caused by the unlawful discrimination; that she sought out professional medical attention for her condition; and that her emotional distress is severe, that it is extensive, that it had lasted for about a year and a half as of the time of the hearing on compensatory damages, and that it was expected to last, in the opinion of her treating physicians, for the foreseeable future. [The doctors did not render an opinion as to the estimated number of years.] We further find that other stressors in her life and her prior emotional episodes have not contributed significantly to her present mental condition so as to warrant a reduction in the award of compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the amount of compensatory damages, it is appropriate to consider the presence or absence of supporting evidence, especially supporting evidence from health-care providers, as to the claimed emotional distress. <span class="Italic">See Lawrence v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952288, slip op. at 5 (Apr. 18, 1996). In this case, the separate reports of Drs. Minisee, Lindsay, Laney, and Shehi, two of whom are psychiatrists, support the appellant's claim for compensatory damages.</p>

After denying the appellant's request for a hearing on the issue of compensatory damages on the basis that there were no factual issues in dispute, the administrative judge (AJ) issued an addendum initial decision, based on the written record, finding that the appellant is entitled to a compensatory damages award in the amount of $3,000 for non-pecuniary losses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, an employee may recover compensatory damages from a federal agency that engaged in unlawful and intentional discrimination against him on the basis of his religion. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2)-(3); <span class="Italic">Hocker v.

The Board may order the payment of compensatory damages when there has been a finding that such discrimination occurred. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(c). As the AJ noted, the Board announced in <span class="Italic">Sloan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 58, 70 (1997), that it would defer to and adopt the EEOC's criteria for proving both the entitlement to and the amount of compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 102(a) of the Civil Rights Act authorizes the award of compensatory damages for pecuniary losses and for non-pecuniary losses, such as, but not limited to, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to character and reputation, and loss of health. Compensatory damages do not include back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of equitable relief authorized by Title VII. To receive an award of compensatory damages, an appellant must demonstrate that he has been harmed as a result of the agency's discriminatory action and must establish the extent, nature, and severity of the harm, as well as the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">Rivera v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed in this appeal that the appellant is seeking only non-pecuniary damages. Such damages are not subject to precise quantification, <span class="Italic">see Sloan,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. at 70, but they are limited to a maximum amount of $300,000, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D). Compensatory damages are further limited to the amount necessary to compensate an injured party for actual harm caused by the agency's discriminatory action, even if the harm is intangible. <span class="Italic">Campos v. Ashcroft,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A03368, 2002 WL 170676, (EEOC Jan. 25, 2002). The EEOC has also noted that the amount of a non-pecuniary damage award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Babbitt,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961483, 1999 WL 139427, (EEOC Mar. 4, 1999) (citing<span class="Italic"> Cygnar v. City of Chicago,</span> 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant submitted evidence, through his own affidavit as well as an affidavit from his sister, that he suffered mental pain and anguish as a result of the agency's actions, and that his professional standing as a Jesuit priest was severely damaged. In particular, the appellant stated that he suffered from anxiety, embarrassment, and humiliation because the agency's discrimination and retaliation against him were a direct affront to his religious beliefs and responsibilities as a Roman Catholic priest of more than 4 decades. The appellant explained that, when his superiors in the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus became aware of his removal, they informed him that everyone in the Society was "embarrassed" by his misconduct and that he had "disgraced" the Society of Jesus. The appellant stated that he was "deeply frustrated and anguished" by his superiors' erroneous perceptions of his conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant averred that, as a result of the agency's actions, his superiors did not give him any pastoral assignments for nearly 9 months after his removal, and the appellant, therefore, was "forced to be idle" for a significant period of time and "lumped together with other priests who had been accused of varying kinds of misconduct. The appellant continued that, during this time, he was totally preoccupied with vindicating his name, and it was only after months of being met with "disbelief and cold shoulders" that the negative perceptions of others toward him began to change. Indeed, the appellant indicated that he felt fully vindicated only after the EEOC found in his favor in January 2007. To avoid the deep embarrassment caused by the agency's false charges and the need to constantly defend his reputation against the allegations of misconduct, the appellant stated that he began to minimize all of his social contacts. He felt "very much alone and isolated."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also stated that the "most distressing" aspect of the agency's removal action to him was that he was cut off from his patients at NIH, many of whom he had developed a "close pastoral relationship" with over the years. He further explained that part of the reason for his removal had been that he had raised concerns about the lack of resources being provided for the spiritual care of Roman Catholic patients, and he felt despondent, angry, and fearful that his sudden departure might be causing his patients to have a "spiritual crisis" and to feel abandoned and neglected during "one of the most trying periods of their life."<span class="Italic"></span> Overall, the appellant stated that the outward manifestations of his emotional distress included sadness, depression, anxiety, embarrassment, frustration, and anger. He also said that, as a priest and devout Catholic, he tries to keep his emotions from affecting his behavior, but he noticed that, despite "profound struggles to keep [his] emotions inside," he became irritable concerning little daily occurrences after the agency's removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's sister, Patricia Heffernan, corroborated his statements. She stated that she noticed a significant change in the appellant's demeanor after the removal action. Prior to it, he was a cheerful person, and a very good story teller. He also had a very hearty appetite during their regular family dinners. After the removal action, Ms. Heffernan reported that the appellant was much less cheerful and more closed. He was quieter at family dinners and did not tell stories as he used to. He seemed not to have the will or the spirit to converse as he had in the past. He was uncharacteristically withdrawn and reserved. Furthermore, his appetite was greatly diminished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not presented medical evidence in support of his compensatory damages claim. The EEOC has held, however, that neither evidence from a medical provider nor expert testimony in general is a mandatory prerequisite for recovery of compensatory damages for mental and emotional distress, and that evidence may include statements from the complainant.<span class="Italic"> See Mayo v. Summers,</span> EEOC Request No. 05990302, 2000 WL 1090667 (EEOC July 21, 2000). In addition, in determining compensatory damages, the EEOC strives to make damage awards for emotional harm consistent with awards in similar cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Insofar as the appellant has submitted evidence of emotional distress and injury to professional reputation without supporting medical documentation, we note that the EEOC has awarded compensatory damages of $25,000 in cases somewhat similar to the appellant's in terms of the duration and harm sustained. <span class="Italic">See Howen v. Principi,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A42618, 2004 WL 2924461 (EEOC Dec. 13, 2004) (finding $25,000 was an appropriate amount as the complainant presented sufficient objective evidence to establish that he had experienced, mental anguish, emotional distress, sleeplessness, irritability, loss of self-esteem, and injury to professional reputation as a result of his termination for a period of 6 months); <span class="Italic">Reneau v. Potter,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A30568, 2004 WL 933346 (EEOC Apr. 20, 2004) ($25,000 awarded in a removal case where the complainant established that she experienced depression, excessive worrying, head pains, headaches, nosebleeds, nervousness, restricted associations, financial strife, loss of credit, and marital hardship for more than a year and a half); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Henderson,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961474, 1999 WL 767784 (EEOC Sept. 10, 1999) ($20,000 awarded for emotional and physical distress over a period of 4 years that included difficulty sleeping, frequent anxiety, crying episodes, headaches and nosebleeds, causing the complainant to decline most overtime work and take sick and annual leave to escape the harassment); <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Cisneros,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961030, 1996 WL 637242 (EEOC Oct. 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970336, 1997 WL 741259 (EEOC Nov. 20, 1997) ($25,000 awarded for sleep problems, frequent crying, weight loss, depression, embarrassment, mental anguish, loss of both self-esteem and enjoyment of life, and disruption of the complainant's relationships with his wife, family, and friends, lasting approximately a year and a half, but mitigated by evidence that other factors unrelated to agency's discrimination contributed to the complainant's distress).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record evidence and the compensatory damages awards in the above cases, and recognizing that there is "'no legal yardstick by which to measure accurately reasonable compensation' for injuries such as emotional distress," <span class="Italic">Sloan,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. at 80 (quoting<span class="Italic"> Spence v. Board of Education,</span> 806 F.2d 1198, 1203 (3d Cir. 1986) (citation omitted)), we find that the appellant is entitled to non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $25,000. In determining the amount of non-pecuniary damages to award, we have considered several factors. The primary factor is that the appellant experienced serious emotional harm as a result of the agency's discrimination for a period of about 2 years. The record shows that this harm included sadness, depression, anxiety, irritability, embarrassment, anger, frustration, loss of appetite, social isolation, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional reputation, and anguish arising from the disruption of long-standing pastoral relationships with medical patients in crisis. Although the absence of medical evidence shows that the appellant's emotional distress and depression were not so severe as to require medical treatment, we still find that the appellant has established that the agency's discriminatory actions caused him significant emotional pain and suffering. Further, although it appears that the damage to his reputation within the Society of Jesus began to be restored in March 2005, when his superiors assigned the appellant to pastoral duties again, the appellant still credibly established that the taint on his reputation continued for nearly 2 years more. We therefore find that the AJ's award of $3,000 was insufficient to compensate the appellant for the non-pecuniary losses suffered as a result of the agency's discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">$20,000 in nonpecuniary damages resulted from the appeal in <span class="Italic">Watkins v. TVA</span>, AT-0752-18-0398-P-1 (NP 4/26/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, nonpecuniary damages include emotion pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 21. An award of compensatory damages for nonpecuniary losses should reflect the extent to which the agency directly or proximately caused the harm and the extent to which other factors also caused the harm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Acceptable evidence of nonpecuniary damages may include a statement by the appellant explaining how he was affected by the discrimination. Id<span class="Italic">.,</span> &#x00B6; 22. Statements from others, including family members, friends, and health care providers may address the outward manifestations of the impact of the discrimination on the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant may also submit documentation of medical or psychiatric treatment related to the effects of the discrimination, although such evidence is not a mandatory prerequisite to establishing entitlement to nonpecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The amount of a nonpecuniary damage award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant sought nonpecuniary damages for emotional pain and suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. He asserted that he experienced these nonpecuniary losses "as a result of an ongoing pattern of retaliation" for equal employment opportunity activity to which he was subjected by the agency. He also claimed that he and his wife suffered "undue stress" resulting from him being out of work, <span id="Page_4936"></span>that he had been attending therapy sessions for stress and anxiety, and that he had been prescribed several different medications. He requested damages "in excess of the jurisdictional limit of $300,000."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, while the record is not entirely clear regarding the extent to which the appellant's nonpecuniary losses are strictly attributable to the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate him, the stress that the appellant suffered as a result of having to adjust to the uncertainties of his work status and loss of income resulting from his retirement constitute compensable nonpecuniary damages. After considering the appellant's statements and comparable cases, he concluded that the appellant was entitled to an award of $20,000 in nonpecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his claim that the emotional stress he experienced warranted nonpecuniary damages in excess of the statutory limit of $300,000. He also asserts that he has been working to get a copy of his medical records reflecting his depression. These arguments do not provide a basis to disturb the initial decision. Although the appellant claims that he is working on getting his medical records, the current record includes only the appellant's unsworn statements and contact information for a Department of Veterans Affairs clinic.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the limited record evidence, we agree with the administrative judge's award of $20,000. He appropriately considered the record evidence and comparable cases and awarded an amount that is not "monstrously excessive." <span class="Italic">See Edwards</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 21. The appellant's petition for review offers no new argument or evidence; he essentially restates his arguments from below, demonstrating mere disagreement with the administrative judge's findings and well-reasoned conclusions. Accordingly, it does not provide a basis to disturb the initial decision.[2] <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings when she considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and reached well-reasoned conclusions); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(a)-(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant's petition for review includes a request for a hearing on the question of nonpecuniary damages. We deny that request. The appellant is not necessarily entitled to a hearing on the issue of compensatory damages, and he did not request a hearing below. Further, the Board's regulations at the petition for review stage do not entitle the appellant to a hearing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.117.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">An award of compensatory damages does not include back pay or other related relief.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below and reasserts on review that the agency failed to provide him the correct amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and sick and annual leave. He argues that he was unable to provide the administrative judge and the Board with the exact amount he believes the agency owed him because it has not responded to his requests to produce that information. Although the initial decision in the underlying matter awarded back pay and related relief, the appropriate avenue to pursue an allegation that the agency has failed to provide proper relief is through a compliance proceeding. The instant case is limited to a motion for compensatory damages, and the statute does not authorize an award of back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of equitable relief authorized by Title VII as a component to a compensatory damages reward. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(2) (stating that compensatory damages shall not include back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of relief authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1964); <span class="Italic">see Heffernan</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 6.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's action was the appellant's removal. As indicated in the following discussion, we see no error in the administrative judge's determinations regarding the appellant's request for compensatory damages. Therefore, we have adopted her recommendation and award the appellant $6,463.50 in pecuniary damages. However, we have increased the award for nonpecuniary damages to $15,000.00. The basis for this award is explained below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pecuniary Damages</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Pecuniary damages are available for out of pocket expenses shown to be related to the discriminatory conduct." <span class="Italic">See Minardi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981955, 2000 WL 33542026, at *2 (Oct. 3, 2000). These damages usually include reimbursement for medical, job hunting, and moving expenses, as well as other quantified out-of-pocket expenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The EEOC requires that claimants document these expenses, typically with receipts, bills, or physicians' statements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Past pecuniary losses are ones that occur before a complaint is resolved and future pecuniary losses are losses likely to occur after a complaint is resolved. The appellant did not request payment for any future pecuniary losses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge recommended granting the appellant's request for reimbursement of payments she made for health insurance premiums, a late fee regarding health insurance premiums, job search mileage and a tax penalty for withdrawing money from her TSP. The administrative judge only recommended denying a very small portion of the appellant's pecuniary damages request. Specifically, she recommended denying the appellant's request for reimbursement of late fees for telephone service and electricity because the appellant's evidence did not clearly indicate that she had actually paid any such late fees. We agree with the administrative judge's assessment of the appellant's evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also denied the appellant's request to be reimbursed for certain medical expenses. Recommendation at 6 (citing <span class="Italic">Keller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A34761, 2004 WL 2148754, at *1 (Sept. 15, 2004) (the appellant failed to demonstrate how each item she identified was proximately caused by her removal, e.g., the reason she consulted doctors, the purposes of the prescription drugs purchased, and how the agency was responsible for the expenditure of the funds)). Specifically, the appellant requested $464.04 as reimbursement for the cost of medications for acne and special shampoos for hair loss that she incurred between October 2009 and June 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of this request, the appellant cited her own statement and the statements of her family, friends, and minister. The appellant claimed that those statements connected the need for those medications to the physical effects of the stress and anxiety she suffered as a result of her removal. The statements that the appellant cites in support of this claim consistently mention the appellant's hair loss and acne problems. The appellant also provided a print-out of her Wal-Mart pharmacy orders for the period of April 1, 2009, to June 27, 2010. Additionally, she provided Progress Notes from her dermatologist dated November 17, 2009, May 4, 2010, and August 5, 2010, in which her dermatologist indicated that the appellant suffered hair-loss and facial acne.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant's dermatologist did not indicate the cause of the appellant's conditions and did not generally indicate the extent of those conditions, except in the August 5, 2010 note, in which the dermatologist wrote that the appellant's hair and facial conditions were "mild." Further, none of the dermatologist's notes address the extent that these conditions were either caused or exacerbated, if at all, by the agency's action. Thus, even accepting the assertions of the appellant and her family, friends, and clergy that these medical conditions worsened after the agency removed her, that alone does not establish a causal connection between the agency's acts and the worsening of the appellant's conditions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Collington v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A03359, 2002 WL 31014618, at *3 (Aug. 30, 2002) (the fact that the conditions worsened after the discriminatory acts does not prove a causal connection between the acts and the worsening of the condition). Without medical evidence indicating that the appellant's medical conditions or the exacerbation of those conditions were caused by the agency's acts, the appellant fails to establish that she incurred the expenses in question as a result of the agency's conduct. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's evidence fails to adequately connect her acne and hair loss, and the expenses attributable to those conditions, to the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4937"></span>As noted above, because we see no error in the administrative judge's determinations, we award the appellant $6,463.50 in past pecuniary damages.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested $150,000 in nonpecuniary damages, claiming that she experienced physical, emotional, spiritual, professional, and financial harm as a result of the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding her physical harm, the appellant claims that her preexisting conditions, i.e., severe allergies, chronic asthma, and bronchiospasms, further deteriorated following her April 10, 2009 removal. The exacerbation of her asthma caused her to use her Albuterol inhaler more frequently and to endure the side effects, i.e., fatigue, sluggishness, lack of energy, and sleepiness, caused by its use. She asserts that she could no longer afford her once or twice-a-week allergy shots and instead took Zyrtec, a less expensive, but also less effective option, which produced side effects of fatigue and dizziness. This change in allergy treatment, she claims, caused her to develop bronchitis two or three times within a year, rather than once, and that her asthma worsened. The appellant also asserts that she could not afford a cleaning service for her home and that the dust she encountered in cleaning it herself caused extreme exhaustion, severe headaches, and more asthma/allergic-type reactions. Moreover, the appellant claimed that she had trouble sleeping because she constantly worried, that her blood pressure went up, and that she had headaches and was fatigued "all the time." As noted above, the appellant also claims hair loss, and she cites the statements of several of her friends and her clergyman in support of that assertion, in addition to some of her other assertions regarding her health. She also attributes the rapid growth of her uterine fibroids to the worry and stress caused by her removal, and claims that her fibroids may interfere with having a baby in the future. The appellant further claims that she ate all the time, purchased unhealthy food because it was cheaper, stopped exercising, and gained weight as a result of the agency's action. She cites the statement of another friend in support of that assertion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding her emotional harm, the appellant asserts that she used to be a giving person, but that she can no longer do so. She further asserts that her personality went from "very bubbly and very outspoken" to distrusting and questioning everything. She describes sitting home and crying, rather than going out as she had done in the past, and her reticence to invite friends and family to her home, or to attend social gatherings, because she did not want others to see her this way. She also describes her loss of self-esteem and confidence, the despair she experienced, and the instability of her moods. She asserts that instead of taking pride in her appearance, she stopped taking care of herself. The statements of the appellant's family, friends, and clergyman support her assertions. For example, the appellant's sister, who lives in the area, wrote that she observed the appellant change from a confident, financially secure, well-dressed and independent woman, to one who was unsure, financially ruined, depressed and dependent. The appellant's neighbor, who saw or spoke to her "almost daily," described seeing her "reduced to just a shadow of her old self" after the agency removed her. The appellant's friends also consistently describe how the appellant was an outgoing and social individual, but became socially reclusive and would not leave her home for days at a time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding spiritual harm, the appellant claims that as a result of her ordeal she felt conflicted in her feelings of faith and relationship with God. Nevertheless, she also claims that she drew strength from her faith during this time and compares her experience to the biblical character Job. The statements of her clergyman and some of her friends support these assertions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding professional harm, the appellant describes the devastation and embarrassment of having to tell prospective employers that she was removed from her federal position because of health reasons. She asserts that she lost years of service and describes the humiliation and hurt she experienced because her peers who started at the same time as she had progressed to management positions, one of them becoming her director. She feels that her career was taken away from her just as it was starting to "blossom" and that her opportunities to advance in her position and be promoted have halted. In this regard, we note that the appellant did find work in the interim, which served to mitigate her damages and perhaps undermine her claim of professional harm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, regarding the financial harm she experienced, the appellant asserts that she went from being financially independent and providing others with help to being constantly worried because her finances were in a state of ruin. She claims that she received several notices that her house was about to go into foreclosure. The appellant asserts that the debts she incurred caused her credit scores to drop significantly, and that she has creditors calling her daily demanding payment and leaving notices on her front door. The appellant describes the embarrassment and humiliation she felt because she was forced to depend on the mercy of her family and friends, to whom she owes several thousand dollars. Her sister affirms that she bought the appellant groceries and that the appellant had to borrow money for basic survival. The statements of the appellant's friends also support her assertions in this regard. The appellant claims that as a result of these financial difficulties, she has considered filing for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant established that she experienced significant physical, emotional, professional, and financial harm as a result of the agency's action, but she did not demonstrate that any of the effects of that harm were permanent, long-term, or catastrophic. Specifically, we find that the appellant showed that her preexisting medical conditions worsened as a result of her removal because, among other things, she had to forego allergy shots in favor of less-effective over the counter medication and use her inhaler more frequently. She had substantial side effects from these medications and developed bronchitis more frequently during the time following her removal. Further, we find that the appellant experienced considerable emotional distress during this time, changing from an outgoing, confident woman to one who was reclusive, distrusting, and uninterested in caring for herself or about her appearance. She also shouldered the embarrassment of telling prospective employers about her removal and may have experienced lost opportunities in her position, but the professional harm that the appellant described was also tempered by her ability to find interim employment. In addition, the appellant established that she experienced considerable financial harm as a result of her removal, requiring her to go into debt, and causing her to be threatened with foreclosure and bankruptcy. Lastly, although the appellant claimed that she experienced spiritual harm following the agency's action, and we do not doubt the appellant's assertion, we find that she also asserted that her experience drew her closer to God and that her faith is now stronger as a result. Thus, we do not find the appellant's claimed spiritual harm compensable. Based on the arbitrator's determination, and as recommended by the administrative judge, we find that the agency must compensate the appellant for the nonpecuniary losses that she incurred during the time between her April 10, 2009 removal and May 14, 2010 reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her recommendation, the administrative judge correctly noted that "[i]n cases where [the] EEOC has awarded nonpecuniary damages of $40,000 and above, the evidence has tended to show that the emotional or psychological injuries which resulted from the agency's action either had permanent or substantially long-term effects or were so catastrophic <span id="Page_4938"></span>that no inquiry into long-term effects was necessary." Recommendation at 10 (citing <span class="Italic">Kannikal v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01960146, 2001 WL 704208, at *4 (June 15, 2001)). After considering the appellant's request, the administrative judge found that the statements that the appellant submitted in support of her request were not sufficient to meet the EEOC's criteria for such an award. The appellant asserted that the harm caused by the agency's action continues. There is nothing in the record, however, to suggest any of the effects she ascribed to her removal are permanent, substantially long-term, or so catastrophic that long-term effects could be presumed. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's assessment of the appellant's evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the Board's determination in <span class="Italic">Heffernan</span> that a "primary factor" in its award of $25,000 in nonpecuniary damages was the fact that the agency's discrimination lasted for about 21/2 years, the administrative judge concluded that the instant appellant is entitled to $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages. More completely stated, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Heffernan</span> that "the appellant experienced serious emotional harm as a result of the agency's discrimination for a period of about 21/2 years." <span class="Italic">Heffernan</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 14. The appellant does not dispute that the harm caused by the agency action is limited to the time of her removal, although, as noted above, the appellant asserted below that the harm she experienced continues "to this day. Nevertheless, the pertinent time period in this matter, as found by the arbitrator, began with the appellant's April 10, 2009 removal and ended with the arbitrator's May 14, 2010 decision ordering her reinstatement, a duration of just over 1 year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC has awarded nonpecuniary damages in other cases involving the physical and emotional harm caused by the exacerbation of a pre-existing asthma condition. <span class="Italic">Collington</span>, 2002 WL 31014618, at *3-4 ($15,000); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652, 1995 WL 434072, at *9 (July 17, 1995) ($75,000). In this matter, the appellant's damages do not come close to those found by the EEOC in Carpenter. For example, the duration of the compensable harm in that case was approximately 2 years, and included, among other things, loss of consortium, thoughts of suicide, panic attacks, and other psychiatric issues. <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, 1995 WL 434072, at *1, *5-7. Additionally, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> experienced more severe stress-related conditions including digestive problems, internal bleeding, Nerve Ending Dermatitis, and hives. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *5-7. Thus, as noted above, we agree with the administrative judge's analysis that the appellant failed to establish the sort of harm found in cases with awards of $40,000 and above. The damages present in the instant matter appear to more closely compare with those found in the <span class="Italic">Collington</span> case, although the time period there, approximately 6 months, was about half that involved in the instant matter, and the appellant in that case was hospitalized. <span class="Italic">Collington</span>, 2002 WL 31014618, at *3-4 (Ms. Collington experienced aggravation of her preexisting asthma, difficulty breathing, tightness in her chest, pain, elevated blood pressure, stress, and anxiety).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The degree, type, and, to a lesser extent, the duration of the emotional harm alleged in this matter are comparable to those asserted in cases awarding nonpecuniary damages in amounts both larger and smaller than the amount recommended by the administrative judge in this matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Barrington v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120101822, 2011 WL 764642, at *1-2, *6 (Feb. 23, 2011) ($25,000 in nonpecuniary damages were awarded for stress, anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, embarrassment, and physical pain associated with the exacerbation of existing medical conditions lasting just over 1 year); <span class="Italic">Logan v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720060093, 2007 WL 2693756, at *1, *4 (Sept. 10, 2007) ($10,000 in nonpecuniary damages were awarded for a 3-year period of emotional harm, stress and anxiety associated with exacerbation of existing medical conditions); <span class="Italic">Caros v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A30094, 2004 WL 368016, at *2-4 (Feb. 19, 2004) ($10,000 in nonpecuniary damages were awarded for a 21/2 year period of low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety associated with exacerbation of existing medical conditions); <span class="Italic">Batieste v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01974616, 2000 WL 731990, at *5-6, n.6 (May 26, 2000) ($12,000 in nonpecuniary damages were awarded for depression, isolation, anxiety, and insomnia experienced over a 21-month period due to the agency's discriminatory termination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the EEOC awarded greater damages in <span class="Italic">Collington</span>, 2002 WL 31014618, at *3-4 ($15,000 for 6 months of harm). In that case, the respondent's existing medical condition, asthma, was the same as the appellant's in this case, but the emotional harm that Ms. Collington experienced was of shorter duration and somewhat greater intensity due to the fact that she was hospitalized. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The EEOC also recently awarded greater damages in <span class="Italic">Barrington</span>, 2011 WL 764642, at *1-2, *6 ($25,000 for just over 1 year of harm). That case involved somewhat similar emotional harm over a nearly identical duration to the instant matter, but involved the exacerbation of a different medical condition, fibromyalgia. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Thus, recognizing that nonpecuniary damages are not subject to precise quantification, <span class="Italic">e.g., Heffernan</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 7, and considering all of the circumstances set forth above and in the cited cases, we find that the appellant is entitled to nonpecuniary damages in the amount of $15,000.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 117 MSPR 222, 224-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-26, 2012 MSPB 1 (2012), considering a finding of disability discrimination, but discounting claims for lost earnings, educational expenses and other claimed pecuniary damages, awarded nonpecuniary compensatory damages of $10,000:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 3, 2009, the appellant filed a motion for compensatory damages, seeking pecuniary damages for losses related to her loss of health benefits ($29,456), costs for pursuing training for other employment ($69,439), finance and interest charges ($420), mortgage-related losses ($20,516), and loss of future earning capacity ($100,000). The appellant also sought damages for nonpecuniary losses for past emotional suffering and mental distress ($100,000), future emotional suffering and mental distress ($120,000), and damage to career ($80,000). In support of her motion, the appellant submitted a personal declaration, a declaration from her husband, Sammy Edwards, and twelve exhibits. The agency responded in opposition to the appellant's motion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding a hearing, the administrative judge granted the appellant's motion for compensatory damages, awarding her $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages but nothing in pecuniary damages. The administrative judge denied the appellant's claims for pecuniary damages based on her loss of health benefits, costs associated with experimental treatment of her breast cancer, and mileage costs for traveling for treatment. The administrative judge found that some of the claimed health services occurred prior to the appellant's removal, that the appellant had medical coverage through her husband's federal health care benefits, that she failed to show that she was required to travel 175 miles per day to receive treatment and that she failed to provide documentation of the claimed treatments. The administrative judge similarly denied the appellant's requests for damages based on claimed costs for pursuing training for other employment because the appellant's degrees were obtained prior to her removal by the agency and because the principal amount of any student loans incurred are not properly paid as compensatory damages. The administrative judge also denied the appellant's requests for claims related to various finance and interest charges because the appellant failed to provide information regarding the timeframe of the incurrence of such charges and failed to show that any of the expenses were directly or proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory conduct. The administrative judge similarly rejected the appellant's claimed damages for mortgage losses, finding that the appellant was in a leave without pay status based on her absence from the workplace for breast cancer treatment when she fell behind on mortgage payments and sought a loan modification that increased the principal amount of the loan by $20,516, and thus she failed to show that her removal, as opposed to her leave without pay status, directly or proximately caused her inability to pay her mortgage. The administrative judge also denied the appellant's claim of $100,000 for loss of future earning capacity, finding that, despite the appellant's contentions to the contrary, the appellant's official personnel folder indicates that she was separated based on her receipt of disability retirement benefits and that the appellant presented no evidence that she has been refused work based on her poor credit rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering and analyzing the wide range of awards for nonpecuniary losses from the Board and the EEOC based on various factors, the administrative judge awarded the appellant $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages. The administrative judge found that the agency's decision to remove the appellant, as opposed to leaving her in a leave without pay status for an additional 3 months, did not result in any loss of income for the appellant as she was unable to work during that time. The administrative judge also found that the appellant suffered from emotional distress independent of the discriminatory acts by the agency, such as her recurring breast cancer and the sudden death of her daughter, and that the appellant failed to submit a medical opinion establishing that her breast cancer worsened as a result of the agency's actions. The administrative judge declined to award the appellant future pecuniary damages for future medical treatment for emotional suffering and mental distress, finding that the future course of the appellant's condition is too speculative without treatment records or means of estimating future emotional pain and suffering connected to the agency's discriminatory acts. The administrative judge lastly declined to award the appellant damages for her claim of damage to her career, finding that the appellant was not medically released to return to work until February 13, 2009, that the appellant presently receives disability retirement benefits from the Office of Personnel Management because of her breast cancer dating back to at least September 2007, and that the appellant thus failed to establish a causation between the agency's discriminatory acts and her future lost wages.</p>

Compensatory damages do not include back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of equitable relief authorized by Title VII.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant disputes the administrative judge's credibility determinations, asserting that the administrative judge's credibility findings were not supported by evidence and that the administrative judge relied on "extraneous and immaterial evidence" in making her credibility findings. The appellant's assertions on these issues are without merit as the administrative judge thoroughly explained her findings that the appellant's declaration was "mendacious" and due little weight, that Mr. Edwards's declaration was not credible, and that the appellant was not a credible witness. The appellant has pointed to nothing that constitutes a sufficiently sound reason to overturn the administrative judge's demeanor-based credibility determinations and nothing to suggest the need for the Board to reweigh the evidence and substitute its own judgment on the credibility issues. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is seeking damages for losses related to her loss of health benefits ($29,456), costs for pursuing training for other employment ($69,439), finance and interest charges ($420), mortgage-related losses ($20,516), and loss of future earning capacity ($100,000). In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge incorrectly applied the law in finding that the appellant is not entitled to pecuniary damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to her health-related costs, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge should have applied the collateral source rule, which provides that, even if the appellant could recover from her insurance company for her experimental cancer treatment in Mexico, such recovery would not offset the agency's liability for the costs.[1] The appellant asserts that the agency is liable for these expenses because they would have been covered by her insurance plan with the agency if she had not been removed. The appellant further asserts that the fact that she was eligible for health insurance through her husband's employer should not serve to enrich the agency. The appellant also asserts that the administrative judge reached an erroneous adverse inference that Mr. Edwards's leave statements would have shown that the appellant had health coverage during the relevant period of time if he had provided them as requested by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The "collateral source" rule holds that "benefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that defendant's liability for damages." <span class="Italic">Finlay v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01942985, 1997 WL 221819, at *10 (Apr. 29, 1997) (citing 1 Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#x00A7; 3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993)). Double recovery is not an issue because complainant's health insurer may recover from him the monies it expended on his behalf. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins v. Department of the Interior</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483, 1999 WL 139427, at *5 (Mar. 4, 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, pecuniary damages are available for out-of-pocket expenses, such as medical expenses, that are shown to be related to the agency's misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01985656, 01A02134, 2001 WL 309379, at *5-6 (Mar. 20, 2001). The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish that the claimed medical expenses were directly or proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory conduct. Indeed, the appellant notes in her petition for review that she "does not claim that her medical expenses were a result of the Agency's discriminatory conduct, only that her loss of health benefits were a result of the unlawful termination." Thus, the appellant's attempt to apply the collateral source rule to the instant circumstances is misplaced. As the agency noted in its response to the appellant's petition for review, the application of the collateral source rule to medical expenses is premised upon first finding that the medical expenses at issue were related to the agency's discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A60181, 2006 WL 1057755, at *3 (Apr. 11, 2006); <span class="Italic">Reneau v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A30568, 2004 WL 933346, at *6 (Apr. 20, 2004). The appellant does not dispute the administrative judge's finding that the medical expenses claimed by the appellant were not related to the agency's discriminatory conduct, and the appellant has provided no reason for broadening the application of the collateral source rule in this way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we have found no legal basis, and the appellant has pointed to none, under EEOC or Board law establishing a right to pecuniary damages for medical expenses unrelated to the agency's discriminatory conduct that otherwise may have been covered under the appellant's health insurance plan but for her removal. Further, regardless of whether the administrative judge's adverse inference that the appellant was covered under her husband's medical insurance was appropriate, the appellant has failed to establish that she was substantively prejudiced by such a finding, given that the medical expenses were not related to the agency's discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984). Moreover, the administrative judge noted that the appellant testified that her husband, a Department of Defense employee, had health benefit coverage as of October 2007. Additionally, the appellant has failed to show how the agency was "enrich[ed]" by the fact that she was eligible for her husband's medical insurance given, again, that the appellant failed to establish that her medical expenses were related to the agency's discriminatory conduct. Accordingly, the appellant's assertion that she is entitled to pecuniary damages for all medical expenses following her loss of health benefits, the loss of which stemmed from her removal, is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to her claimed educational expenses, the appellant asserts in her petition for review that, even though much of her education took place before she was removed, "some of the costs were incurred as Appellant was not being paid [due to] the Agency's failure to provide her reasonable accommodation, leading up to her removal." The appellant once again fails to point to evidence that shows she incurred educational expenses as a result of the agency's discriminatory conduct, particularly as the evidence shows that the appellant finished her degrees in 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to her mortgage-related costs, the appellant concedes that she was falling behind on her mortgage before she was removed due to the fact that she was in a leave without pay status for purposes of undergoing treatment for breast cancer. However, she asserts that she was "[u]ltimately...forced to seek a loan modification after she was terminated because of her continued loss of income" and that her loan modification was therefore a direct and proximate result of her removal.<span class="Italic"></span> However, this assertion is without merit because the EEOC has recognized that expenses such as rent, tax payments, mortgage payments and living expenses would have been incurred whether an appellant was discriminated against or not. <span class="Italic">See Mature v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20065, 2003 WL 1440662, at *4 (Mar. 17, 2003); <span class="Italic">Wan v.

In other words, it cannot be said that these expenses would not have occurred "but for" the agency's discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Mature</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A20065, 2003 WL 1440662, at *4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to her claim of loss of future earning capacity, the appellant asserts in her petition for review that she accepted disability retirement <span id="Page_4940"></span>only because the agency did not offer her a position that accommodated her medical restrictions and that she otherwise would have returned to work. Where an employee has shown that her future earning power has been diminished as a result of the agency's discrimination, the EEOC has awarded future pecuniary damages for the loss of future earning capacity. <span class="Italic">Reed v. Department of Transportation</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080520, 2011 WL 397051, at *6 (Jan. 21, 2011). Proof of entitlement to loss of future earning capacity involves evidence suggesting that the individual's injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to her. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Generally, the party seeking compensation for loss of earning capacity needs to provide evidence which demonstrates with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability that the loss has been sustained. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Additionally, there must be evidence to allow the fact finder to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss. <span class="Italic">See Conrad v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120090690, 2010 WL 1514298, at *7 (Apr. 9, 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertions on review provide no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings with respect to the appellant's claim of loss of future earning capacity. The appellant based her claim of loss of future earning capacity on her assertion that her personnel records indicate that she was removed for failing to attend work and on the fact that her credit rating is poor because she could not pay her bills. As the administrative judge found, the appellant's official personnel file indicates that she separated from the agency in October 2008 as a result of disability retirement. The administrative judge further found that the appellant failed to submit evidence showing that her credit rating had negatively affected her employment prospects, especially in light of the appellant's testimony that she had only applied for two positions, one for which she was overqualified and the other from which she never received a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has provided no reason to disturb the administrative judge's award of $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonpecuniary damages constitute the sums necessary to compensate an injured party for actual harm, even where the harm is intangible. <span class="Italic">Carter v. Duncan-Higgans, Ltd.</span>, 727 F.2d 1225 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Nonpecuniary losses are losses that are not subject to precise quantification including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character and reputation, injury to credit standing, and loss of health. S<span class="Italic">ee Sloan</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 70. An award of compensatory damages for nonpecuniary losses should reflect the extent to which the agency directly or proximately caused the harm and the extent to which other factors also caused the harm. The award should take into account the severity and duration of the harm, although nonpecuniary damages are limited to a maximum amount of $300,000. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3)(D); <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120072458, 2008 WL 5479223, at *5 (Nov. 10, 2008). The EEOC has stated that the amount of a nonpecuniary damage award should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Jenkins</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961483, 1999 WL 139427, at *6 (citing <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chicago</span>, 865 F.2d 827, 848 (7th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Objective evidence of nonpecuniary damages may include a statement by the complainant explaining how she was affected by the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Carle v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01922369, 1993 WL 1504728, at *4 (Jan. 5, 1993). Statements from others, including family members, friends, and health care providers may address the outward manifestations of the impact of the discrimination on the complainant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The complainant may also submit documentation of medical or psychiatric treatment related to the effects of the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, evidence from a health care provider is not a mandatory prerequisite to establishing entitlement to nonpecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Sinnott v. Department of Defense</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952872, 1996 WL 546877, at *6 (Sept. 19, 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC has recognized that an appellant is entitled to recover damages only for injury, or additional injury, caused by the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Terrell v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961030, 1996 WL 637242, at *12 (Oct. 25, 1996), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970336 (Nov. 20, 1997). Where a complaining party's emotional harm is due in part to personal difficulties which were not caused or exacerbated by the discriminatory conduct, the employer is liable only for the harm resulting from that conduct. Guidance at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">Vance v. Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Co.</span>, 863 F.2d 1503 (11th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is seeking damages for nonpecuniary losses for past emotional suffering and mental distress ($100,000), future emotional suffering and mental distress ($120,000), and damage to career ($80,000). In her petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge misapplied EEOC law in finding that the appellant's failure to seek medical treatment for her depression and anxiety for 2 years after her removal diminished the appellant's claim that she suffered from debilitating depression because the EEOC has repeatedly held that medical documentation is not necessary to support a claim for nonpecuniary damages. Citing various EEOC decisions awarding upwards of $75,000 in nonpecuniary damages, the appellant further asserts that she "suffered tremendously" as a result of her removal by the agency and that she submitted evidence that she sought counseling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the administrative judge did not specifically rely on the appellant's failure for 2 years to seek medical treatment for her alleged depression and anxiety following her removal to find that the appellant was entitled to only $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages as opposed to the appellant's requested $300,000. Rather, in making her credibility determinations upfront, the administrative judge noted that the appellant's failure for 2 years to seek treatment for her alleged depression and anxiety resulting from the agency's discriminatory conduct "diminishe[d] her claims that she suffered from debilitating depression, anxiety, etc." Further, EEOC precedent does not prohibit the Board from considering whether an appellant has provided supporting medical evidence of her claim for nonpecuniary damages; rather, it simply provides that such evidence is not mandatory in awarding compensatory damages for nonpecuniary losses. <span class="Italic">See Sinnott</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952872, 1996 WL 546877, at *6. Whether with supporting medical evidence or other evidence, the appellant must still prove her injury and that the agency's discriminatory conduct caused the injury. <span class="Italic">See Terrell</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961030, 1996 WL 637242, at *12. Additionally, the EEOC has explicitly recognized that "the absence of supporting evidence [to support a claim of emotional distress] may affect the amount of damages deemed appropriate in specific cases." <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01952288, 1996 WL 197403, at *5 (Apr. 18, 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge here conducted a thorough and lengthy analysis of several lines of EEOC cases granting a wide range of awards for nonpecuniary damages, and she specifically noted cases in which the appellant had or had not presented supporting medical evidence. In arriving at an award of $10,000 in nonpecuniary damages, the administrative judge found that the appellant suffered from emotional distress, such as her breast cancer and the death of her daughter, independent of the agency's discriminatory conduct that had to be considered and that an award of $10,000 was in line with other EEOC decisions, which involved similar general claims and lacked supporting objective medical evidence. The appellant fails in her petition for review to identify any error by the administrative judge in relying upon the cases cited in the addendum initial decision or in considering that the appellant did not seek treatment for her depression and anxiety stemming from the agency's discriminatory acts until 2 years after she was removed. Furthermore, each of the EEOC decisions cited by the appellant in her petition for review in support of her claim for nonpecuniary damages is distinguishable from the instant case because the employees in those cases provided supporting evidence in the form of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, credible testimony by the appellant, credible statements from family and friends, and/or unrebutted medical evidence that is absent from the instant case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Maeso v.
