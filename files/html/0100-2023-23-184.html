<p class="Body-Text">An enforcement claim alone does not, according to the Federal Circuit, create mixed case jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1217-19 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reid was removed from his position with the Department of the Navy (Navy or agency) as an Electronics Engineer in 1989. On appeal to the board, the parties settled their disputes and Reid withdrew his appeal. The settlement agreement was entered into the record. Subsequently, Reid petitioned the board to enforce the settlement agreement, alleging that the Navy had breached the terms of the agreement. He claimed that the Navy failed to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement because, among other reasons, the agency discriminated against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) found that the Navy had fully complied with the agreement, and without addressing the discrimination claim, dismissed Reid's enforcement petition. On petition for review, the full board affirmed the AJ's decision on the merits but reopened the case because the AJ failed to consider the discrimination claim. Although finding no evidence of discrimination in its review, the board decided that Reid's claim of discrimination gave his case a "mixed case" status under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) and provided him mixed case appeal rights<span class="Italic">. Reid I</span> [<span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 663 (1991)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM requested the board to reconsider its decision. OPM argued that a petition to enforce a settlement agreement is not an appealable action within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7702 and thus it cannot be combined with a discrimination claim to qualify as a mixed case. In <span class="Italic">Reid II</span> [<span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 354 (1994)], the board denied OPM's request and affirmed its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Reid I</span>, reasoning that "[g]iven the fact that a breach of a settlement agreement is an appealable action, it follows from [5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)] that such an action is a mixed case when the appellant alleges that the breach resulted from discrimination." This petition for review followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We review decisions of the board under the standard of review prescribed by statute. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c). On questions of statutory interpretation and jurisdictional issues, the board's decision is reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 F.3d 514 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board's subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate agency actions is limited. Congress defined the board's powers and functions in the following manner:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under this title, section 4323 of title 38, or any other law, rule, or regulation, and, subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take final action on any such matter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1). Thus the board's power to adjudicate an action is restricted to matters where its jurisdiction is specifically provided for by law, rule, or regulation. Ancillary to the board's power to adjudicate actions is the board's authority to enforce its own orders. Congress provided in the next paragraph of &#x00A7; 1204 that the board would have the power to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection and enforce compliance with any such order;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim of discrimination, standing alone, is insufficient to invoke the board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>). Congress has provided venues other than the board to review claims of discrimination generally. The board may, however, decide claims of discrimination in limited circumstances. Congress provided that the board may decide a claim of discrimination when it forms a basis for an agency action over which the board otherwise has jurisdiction (commonly referred to as an "appealable action"). Such a case is known as a "mixed" case. Specifically, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;has been affected by an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Board shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appealable actions are those agency actions expressly made appealable to the board by any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1). These include, for example, adverse actions under Chapter 75 of Title 5 and performance-based actions under Chapter 43, as well as agency actions made appealable to the board by regulation, as for example 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.401(c) (failure to restore or improper restoration of executive department employees who suffer compensable injuries).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the board concluded that the breach of the settlement agreement was an "appealable action" which when coupled with Reid's claim of discrimination required that the board provide Reid with mixed case appeal rights. We disagree. Section 7702(a)(1) allows the board to decide an issue of discrimination only when it is a "basis" for "an action which the employee or appellant may appeal to the [board]." Nowhere in the statutes nor in any rule or regulation is a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement expressly made appealable to the board. Although a breach of a settlement agreement by the government undoubtedly involves an agency action, it is not one of those agency actions described as being appealable to the board. It is not, therefore, an action described in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(A) which will support a mixed case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board itself has apparently now abandoned the position stated in its opinion below that a breach of a settlement agreement is an appealable action. It does not make this argument in its brief on appeal. Instead the board now argues that since the original action was appealable the board retains jurisdiction to entertain petitions for enforcement and that when an allegation of discrimination is included in the petition, the mixed case provisions apply. Again, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, the board's jurisdiction over appealable actions is limited to those set out in a law, rule, or regulation. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1). Although employees may petition the board to exercise its preexisting jurisdiction to <span class="Italic">enforce</span> settlement agreements already entered into the record, the board is not then acting under its &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1) authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Amin v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1252 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (distinguishing between appeals that are resolved by settlements and later filed petitions to enforce the settlements, but recognizing the petitions may raise issues intertwined with the merits of the original appeal); <span class="Italic">see also Perry v. Department of Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Once a settlement agreement has been entered into the record, the original appealable action is withdrawn or dismissed. The board retains jurisdiction over a settlement agreement made part of the record pursuant to its power under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) to enter and enforce its own orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that under the board's retained jurisdiction, 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), the board may decide whether an agency has breached a settlement agreement entered on the record and thus violated its order. It may not, however, decide a claim of discrimination that is alleged to be a basis in whole or in part for the agency's acts of noncompliance. The board's jurisdiction to hear discrimination allegations arises only in connection with an otherwise appealable action under any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, a claim of discrimination contained in a petition to enforce a settlement agreement does not give rise to mixed case status and the board erred when it granted Reid mixed case appeal rights.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Diehl v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 620, 625-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (1999), followed the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Reid</span> decision, but added that violation of a no-discrimination clause in a settlement may demonstrate sufficient bad faith in the agency's implementation of the agreement to warrant its rescission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement contained the following provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency agrees that the Appellant will not be subjected to discrimination or reprisal of any kind as a result of this appeal or settlement of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that agency officials purposely acted to delay his receipt of payments due under the agreement and ignored the agreement's nondisclosure provision, and that those actions were in reprisal for his Board appeal and were discriminatory based on his disability. He requests a hearing on these issues to prove compensatory damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's power to adjudicate an action is restricted to matters where its jurisdiction is specifically provided for by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Board may only decide a claim of discrimination or reprisal where the alleged wrongful act forms a basis for an agency action over which the Board otherwise has jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). In <span class="Italic">King v. Reid,</span> 59 F.3d 1215, 1218 (Fed. Cir. 1995), our reviewing court determined that a petition for enforcement alleging a breach of a settlement agreement is not an action that was made appealable to the Board by any law, rule or regulation, and therefore cannot support a claim of discrimination. The court stated that where, as in the instant case, a claim of discrimination "is alleged to be a basis in whole or in part for the agency's acts of noncompliance," the Board may not decide that claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1219. Thus, since the appellant here could only prevail in his claim for compensatory damages upon a finding that the agency violated a federal anti-discrimination statute in conjunction with its noncompliance, we deny his request that the case be remanded for a hearing on compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Nordhoff v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 64 MSPR 478, 485 (1994) (the Board may only award compensatory damages to an employee prevailing on a claim that implicates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990), <span class="Italic">modified on other</span> <span class="Italic">grounds,</span> 78 MSPR 88, 90 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> No. 98-3210, 1999 WL 128034 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 9, 1999).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that a claim of reprisal for filing a Board appeal or an EEO complaint may also be characterized as a claim that the agency took a prohibited employment practice<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(9). Compensatory damages are not available for a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9), however. If the appellant could establish a violation of that section of the statute, it is certainly arguable that he would have shown that the agency breached the obligation to perform in good faith<span class="Italic">. See Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 323 (1995). Nevertheless, because we have already found that the agency breached the agreement we need not further discuss this claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This finding does not mean that an appellant may never attempt to establish that an agency's acts of reprisal or harassment in implementing provisions of a settlement agreement constitute a breach. The Board recognizes that every settlement agreement contains an implicit requirement that the parties fulfill their respective contractual obligations in good faith. <span class="Italic">See Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 323 (1995). Thus, even if an agreement does not specifically prohibit retaliation or harassment, an appellant may establish that the agency breached the settlement agreement by showing that the agency's retaliatory/harassing actions constituted bad-faith noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, where, as here, a settlement agreement explicitly defines the extent of the agency's obligation to forego and prevent reprisal, the appellant may establish breach by showing that the agency violated the specific provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Womack v. United States Postal Service,</span> 63 MSPR 213, 217 (1994), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 36 F.3d 1111, 1994 WL 467003 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Until <span class="Italic">King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the Board was of the opinion, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Myers v. USDA,</span> 31 MSPR 312, 317-18 n.3 (1986), that the Board could consider allegations of discrimination concerning an enforcement proceeding (concerning enforcement of a settlement agreement relating to consideration for promotion). The Board reiterated in <span class="Italic">Bergman v. DOJ</span>, 56 MSPR 42, 45 (1992), that an AJ should address a claim of disability discrimination pertaining to a specific compliance issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 211, 213-14 (1994); <span class="Italic">Woods v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 156, 160 (1994) ("To the extent that [appellant's] discrimination claims relate to a specific issue of compliance, they would come within the Board's jurisdiction[.]"). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kramer v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 318, 319 (1992) ("Unlike his handicap discrimination allegation, the appellant's racial discrimination claim had no bearing on the voluntariness of the settlement agreement.... Furthermore, once the administrative judge found the settlement agreement to be valid, she lacked the authority to consider the discrimination claim."). <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 354, 357-58 (1994), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determined that if an appellant raises allegations of discrimination in an enforcement proceeding (in <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, involving enforcement of a settlement), the Board should provide a notice of mixed case appeal rights in its compliance decision. The Board lacks jurisdiction to enforce a settlement reached in an EEO case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shepard v. VA,</span> AT-3443-15-0689-I-1 (NP 4/13/2016) ("Furthermore, contrary to the appellant's argument on review, this is not a mixed case, and the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider her claim under mixed-case procedures. A mixed case involves both a claim of discrimination and a personnel action that is normally appealable to the Board. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). Here, the challenged agency actions--the alleged breach of a settlement agreement or the agency's failure to transfer the appellant to her prior duty station--are not actions that are otherwise appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a); <span class="Italic">King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1218-19 (Fed. Cir. 1995); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3. Because the appellant has not shown that she suffered any otherwise appealable action, the Board does not have jurisdiction over her appeal as a mixed case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of whistleblowing reprisal arising in an enforcement petition were briefly addressed in <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 556, 561 &#x00B6; 12 (2002), apparently concluding that they could not be adjudicated other than to show that the agency breached a settlement by acting in bad faith.</p>
