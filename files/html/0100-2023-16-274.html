<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-274"><span class="space">1.</span> Time for Filing Charge</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7118(a)(4):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge with the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;If the General Counsel determines that the person filing any charge was prevented from filing the charge during the 6-month period referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by reason of--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;any failure of the agency or labor organization against which the charge is made to perform a duty owed to the person, or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;any concealment which prevented discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice during the 6-month period,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the General Counsel may issue a complaint based on the charge if the charge was filed during the 6-month period beginning on the day of the discovery by the person of the alleged unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Any charge alleging an unfair labor practice based on conduct or events that occurred more than six months before the filing of the charge is untimely, unless it is established that the respondent agency or labor organization prevented the person filing the charge from discovering the allegedly unlawful conduct within the six-month limitation period by concealment or by failing to perform a duty owed to the charging party. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 2513</span>, 20 FLRA 296, 297 (1985). An example would be when the respondent has a duty to inform the union of an event and fails to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NRC and NTEU</span>, 44 FLRA 370, 381 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">Of the six-month limitation period, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Lower Colorado Dams Project, Water and Power Resources Serv. and IBEW Local 640</span>, 14 FLRA 539 (1984), declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ny charge alleging an unfair labor practice which is necessarily based on conduct or events which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge is untimely under the provisions of section 7118(a)(4)(A) of the Statute, unless it is established that the respondent agency or labor organization prevented the person filing the charge from discovering the allegedly unlawful conduct within the 6-month limitations period by concealment or by failing to perform a duty owed to the charging party. This limiting provision has the effect of preventing the litigation of stale charges, wherein the recollection of witnesses may be clouded, the availability of witnesses is diminished, and the loss of documentary evidence is increased. To allow the processing of complaints which rely, as the basis for the allegation of violation, on conduct which occurred more than 6 months prior to the filing of the charge upon which the complaint is based would be contrary to express statutory language. However, in the opinion of the Authority, where the conduct or events complained of occur within the 6-month period preceding the filing of the charge and in and of themselves may constitute unfair labor practices, evidence of events occurring more than 6 months prior to the filing of the charge may be utilized to explain the conduct or events occurring within the 6-month period.</p>
<p class="noindent">The period for filing a ULP charge is an affirmative defense that is waived if it is not raised before the close of the hearing, <span class="Italic">Army Armament Research Dev. and Eng'g Ctr. Picatinny Arsenal and NFFE Local 1437</span>, 52 FLRA 527, 532-34 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A statutory time limit, such as that contained in section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute, operates either as a jurisdictional requirement, which limits the right of a party to bring an action, or as a statute of limitation, which limits only the remedy available. 2A James W. Moore <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Moore's Federal Practice</span>, &#x00B6; 8.27[4], at 8-190 to 8-193 n.6 (2d ed. 1996). Defenses based on jurisdictional time limits can be raised at any time, even on appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.23, at 12-236 to 12-242. Statutes of limitation are affirmative defenses and, as such, are waived unless raised in the pleadings or at trial. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 8.27[41], at 8-190 to 8-193 n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent did not raise section 7118(a)(4) prior to the close of the hearing, the Judge dismissed the second allegation in the complaint on the basis of this defense. By doing so, the Judge implicitly construed section 7118(a)(4) to be a jurisdictional requirement that can be raised at any time. The General Counsel's argument that the Judge should not have addressed this defense is, in effect, a claim that section 7118(a)(4) is a statute of limitation that must be raised prior to the close of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority case law on this issue is largely undeveloped.&#x2003;Therefore, we look to private sector law for guidance. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Geological Survey and Caribbean District</span> <span class="Italic">Office, San Juan, Puerto</span> <span class="Italic">Rico</span>, 50 FLRA 548, 550 (1995). We note, in this regard, that "[w]here there are comparable provisions under the Statute and the NLRA [National Labor Relations Act], decisions of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the courts interpreting the NLRA have a 'high degree of relevance' to similar circumstances under the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, Local 12, 37 FLRA 1371, 1381 (1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing supports our application of case law addressing section 10(b) of the NLRA (29 USCA. &#x00A7; 160(b) (West 1973)). As relevant here, the language of section 7118(a)(4)(A) is nearly identical to that of section 10(b), and the tolling provision contained in section 7118(a)(4)(B) is consistent with NLRB case law. In addition, the NLRB has addressed defenses based on section 10(b) of the NLRA in circumstances similar to the facts of this case. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Public Service Company of Colorado and IBEW</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 111</span>, 312 NLRB 459 (1993), the Respondent raised section 10(b) for the first time in its post-hearing brief. In holding that the section 10(b) defense was not properly before it, the Board stated: "Section 10(b) is an affirmative defense and, if not timely raised, is waived. As the [r]espondent did not raise this defense until after the hearing had closed, it is clearly untimely<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 461; <span class="Italic">see also K &#x0026; E Bus Lines</span>, 255 NLRB 1022, 1029 (1981); <span class="Italic">LIUNA, Local 252</span>, 233 NLRB 1358 n.2 (1977). Where the Board has determined that a judge erroneously dismissed a case under section 10(b), the remedy has been to reinstate the case and remand it for a ruling on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Kanakis Co.</span>, 293 NLRB 435, 435-37 (1989); <span class="Italic">Sheet Metal Workers' Int'l Ass'n, Local Union No. 75 and Mike</span> <span class="Italic">Benavidez</span>, 290 NLRB 381, 382-84 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the similarities between sections 7118(a)(4) of 10(b) of the NLRA, and as no basis is argued or apparent for concluding that we should reach a different conclusion than the NLRB, we will apply NLRB precedent to this case. In doing so, we conclude that section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute is an affirmative defense that was not properly before the Judge because the Respondent failed to raise it prior to the close of the hearing. <span class="Italic">Accord Zipes</span>, 455 U.S. at 395 n.11, (explaining that NLRA was the model for Title VII's remedial provisions and reasoning that "[b]ecause the time requirement for filing [a] [ULP] charge under the [NLRA] operates as a statute of limitations...and not as a restriction of the jurisdiction of the [NLRB], the time limitations under Title VII should be treated likewise.") <span id="page_1557"></span>(citations omitted). As the Judge erroneously dismissed the second allegation in the complaint on the basis of the Respondent's untimely 7118(a)(4) defense, we remand this aspect of the complaint to the Chief Administrative Law Judge for further action consistent with this decision.</p>

<p class="noindent">For a unilateral change in conditions of employment, the six-month statute of limitations runs from the date that the charging party has "clear and unequivocal notice of unilateral implementation" of a change in working conditions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey and AFGE Local 723</span>, 68 FLRA 734, 736-37 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the ULP charge was untimely.&#x2003;Section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute provides that "no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged [ULP] which occurred more than [six] months before the filing of the charge with the Authority," unless a "failure of [the charged party] to perform a duty owed to the [charging party]" or "concealment...prevented discovery of the alleged [ULP] during the [six]-month period." In cases involving a unilateral change in conditions of employment, the six-month statute of limitations runs from the date on which the charging party has "clear and unequivocal notice of unilateral implementation" of a change in working conditions.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency first argues that the charge was untimely because the six-month statute of limitations began to run when it provided notice of the planned reduction in M&#x0026;IE rates on April 26. The Agency does not claim that it actually implemented the change in M&#x0026;IE rates on April 26. Rather, it argues that announcement of a proposed change in working conditions should be the triggering event in failure-to-bargain cases. However, Authority precedent, as well as that of the National Labor Relations Board,[23] holds that the six-month time limit commences when the alleged ULP occurs, not when notice of a proposed change is given to the union.[24] Here, the Union alleged that the Agency implemented a change in working conditions without first providing the Union with an opportunity to bargain. Thus, the six-month limitation period commenced when the Agency implemented the change in M&#x0026;IE rates.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Howard Elec. &#x0026; Mech</span>., 293 NLRB 472, 475 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Am. Distrib. Co. v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the Union had "constructive notice" that it implemented the change before May 15. Constructive notice applies where a party could have learned of an alleged ULP through "the exercise of reasonable diligence."[26] But "reasonable diligence" does not "require the [u]nion to maintain or exercise...[an] extreme level of suspicious imagination or hypervigilance."[27] Here, the Agency's email stated that "implementation of the camp rate for the [Agency] will take effect on May 15." In light of this unequivocal statement, investigating whether the Agency had actually implemented the reduced M&#x0026;IE rates a few days before May 15 would require an "extreme level of suspicious imagination or hypervigilance,"[29] rather than the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even assuming that the Agency has established that it implemented the reduced M&#x0026;IE rates for bargaining-unit employees on May 11, as it claims in its exceptions, the exceptions to the six-month rule would apply. In this regard, the Agency failed to perform a duty owed to the Union by not providing the contractually required notice setting forth the planned implementation date, and its statement that "implementation...will take effect on May 15," would have had the effect of concealing its earlier implementation of the reduced M&#x0026;IE rates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we find that the ULP charge was timely filed and, therefore, deny the Agency's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the AFAFC failed to notify the Union of the change in employees' hours of work in the SJA Office, thereby failing to perform a duty owed to the Union. The Union was unaware of the change in the SJA Office until it discovered the change on August 28, 1989. While there is no evidence of intentional concealment, the Union had no knowledge of the change in the AWS in the SJA Office within 6 months of the date the change occurred. Therefore, we find that the charge, filed within weeks after the Union learned of the change, is timely filed.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7118(a)(4)(A) of the Statute requires that a charge be filed within six months of the alleged unfair labor practice. The charge must be "based on events occurring within the six-month period preceding the original charge[.]" <span class="Italic">United States Penitentiary, Florence, Colorado</span>, 53 FLRA 1393, 1402 (1998). The Authority has recognized that, at times, a charging party may not learn of an alleged unfair labor practice immediately, either due to a respondent's failure to perform a duty owed to the charging party or because of the respondent's concealment of the alleged unfair labor practice. In such circumstances, &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(B) of the Statute permits the General Counsel to issue a complaint when the charging party has filed an unfair labor practice charge within six months of discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Williams Air Force Base, Chandler, Ariz.</span>, 38 FLRA 549, 560-61 (1990) (failure of agency to provide union with notice of change in working conditions warranted suspension of six month filing deadline for unfair labor practice charge).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In asserting that the charge was not timely filed, the Respondent argues that "the correction from eighty (80) to eight (8) remedial training hours" had been approved by the (Acting) Commissioner on May 15, 2001 and that "the alleged unfair labor practice occurred, if at all, on May 15, 2001." The Respondent adds that since the unfair labor practice charge was filed on August 30, 2002, the charge was untimely filed "and the complaint based upon the cha[r]ge should have been dismissed." The General Counsel argues that the Judge's factual findings support the conclusion that the charge was timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether or not the Respondent is correct that the change was made on May 15, 2001, the Judge found that the Union representative did not receive a copy of the Commissioner's approval of the allotment of remedial firearms training until April 3, 2002, when it was distributed to the Board members. The Respondent does not dispute this factual finding, which is supported by the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp.</span>, 48 FLRA 1211, 1215 (1993) (when reviewing a judge's factual findings, the Authority reviews the record to determine whether those factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole). The unfair labor practice charge was filed on August 30, 2002, well within the requisite six-month filing period. Accordingly, we find that the charge was timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">A strict interpretation of a six-month limit for filing a ULP over a failure-to-bargain ULP charge was avoided when management did not provide the union with adequate notice of the scope and nature of the change of employment conditions in <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-88.html">65 FLRA 422</a>, 422-25 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Respondent had an established practice of firstline supervisors granting certain employees administrative leave on their birthdays (hereinafter "birthday leave"). In July 2008, the Union's President (the President) "heard rumors" that the Respondent planned to eliminate that practice.<span class="Italic"> </span>The President wrote a letter to the Respondent, in which the President "protested the termination of the practice and requested that the Respondent reimplement the practice immediately...."<span class="Italic"> </span>In response, the Respondent informed the Union that it was "rescinding the previous notice to the [employees]" regarding not granting birthday leave, and stated that "[i]f management determines to revisit this issue, the [U]nion will be given official notification."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 29, 2008, the Respondent sent the President a letter stating, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This is to inform you that first line supervisors...do not have the authority or discretion to grant [employees birthday leave]. Therefore, effective December 28, 2008, management will terminate the practice of allowing first line supervisors the discretion of granting [birthday leave].... Management will continue to approve or disapprove "excused absences" in accordance with regulations and policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 8, 2008, the President responded by letter stating, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">While we are not entirely sure if the [Respondent's] proposal is intended to impact, in any way, the affected bargaining unit employees' entitlement to [birthday] leave,[1] we will, in an exercise of caution, nonetheless make known our demand to bargain over the proposed change(s), to the fullest extent allowed by law. Moreover, the Union hereby proposes and insists that the [Respondent] <span id="page_1558"></span>hold any change(s) pertaining to the [Respondent's] proposal in abeyance until the completion of all phases of bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[1]&#x2003;At the hearing, the President testified that he found it unclear whether the Respondent was proposing to change "what level of supervision[&#8197;]" would be able to approve birthday leave, or whether the Respondent was proposing to change the entire practice of changing birthday leave. In this regard, the President testified that he believed that the Respondent would be obligated to bargain only in the latter situation, not the former.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The President then submitted five proposals and reserved the right to submit additional proposals.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent did not respond to the President's letter or communicate further with the Union regarding this matter during 2008.<span class="Italic"> </span>In 2009, an employee whose birthday was January 2 did not receive birthday leave. Subsequently, other employees ceased receiving such leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Union learned that employees had been denied birthday leave, the President contacted the Respondent's liaison with the Union (the liaison). The liaison told the President that he would "look into the situation," but did not follow up with the President. Later, the President again discussed the situation with the liaison, who suggested that the President should contact the Respondent's legal office.<span class="Italic"> </span>The President did so, but on June 29, 2009, filed the ULP charge at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7118(a)(4)(A) of the Statute requires that a charge be filed within six months of the alleged ULP. <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, Border &#x0026; Transp. Sec. Directorate, Bureau of Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 943, 950 (2005) (then Member Pope concurring in part and dissenting in part on other grounds), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 446 F.3d 162 (D.C.

The Authority has recognized that, at times, a charging party may not learn of an alleged ULP immediately, either due to a respondent's failure to perform a duty owed to the charging party or because of the respondent's concealment of the alleged ULP. 60 FLRA at 950. In such circumstances, &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(B) of the Statute permits the GC to issue a complaint when the charging party has filed a ULP charge within six months of discovery of the alleged ULP. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held that notice of a proposed change in conditions of employment must be sufficiently specific and definitive to adequately provide the exclusive representative with a reasonable opportunity to request bargaining. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, Def. Commissary Agency, Peterson Air Force Base, Colo. Springs, Colo.</span>, 61 FLRA 688, 692 (2006). For example, the notice must apprise the exclusive representative of the scope and nature of the proposed change in conditions of employment, the certainty of the change, and the planned timing of the change. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In this regard, the Authority has stated that "[t]he notice must be sufficient to inform the exclusive representative of what will be lost if it does not request bargaining." <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis Dist., Memphis, Tenn.</span>, 53 FLRA 79, 82 (1997). Further, the Authority has held that the obligation to bargain under the Statute includes, at a minimum, the requirement that a party respond to a bargaining request. <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.</span>, 59 FLRA 48, 52 (2003) (then Member Pope dissenting in part on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge stated that "the change was implemented, as announced, on December 28," she did not find that the Respondent actually took any actions on that date. In addition, there is conflicting record evidence on this point. In this regard, while the employee whose birthday is January 2 testified that the Respondent announced the change "a week before my birthday," another employee testified that he "believe[d] it was the first of the year[&#8197;]" when the Respondent announced the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the Respondent actually implemented the change on December 28, the Union did not learn of the change immediately because the Respondent failed to perform duties owed to the Union. In this regard, the Respondent did not provide the Union with adequate notice of the scope and nature of the change--specifically, whether it merely eliminated the authority of first-line supervisors to grant birthday leave, or whether it wholly eliminated employees' entitlement to such leave. Although the Union reasonably questioned the scope and nature of the proposed change and requested bargaining as "an exercise of caution," the Respondent neither clarified the scope and nature of the change nor responded to the bargaining request. In these circumstances, even assuming that the Respondent wholly eliminated employees' entitlement to birthday leave on December 28, the Union's lack of awareness, prior to January 2, that management had done so was due to the Respondent's failure to perform duties that it owed to the Union--in particular, its duties to provide adequate notice of the change and to respond to the Union's bargaining request. Thus, the above-cited Authority precedent supports a finding that the charge, which was filed within six months of January 2, was timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decisions cited by the Judge do not support a contrary conclusion.&#x2003;In this regard, unlike the charging party in <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, the President did not merely wait over eight months after discovering the ULP before filing the charge. <span class="Italic">See </span>20 FLRA at 297. Instead, the President repeatedly attempted to seek more information from the Respondent, and filed the charge only after those attempts were unfruitful. Thus, unlike the charging party in <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, the President had a reasonable reason for not immediately filing the charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Authority found that: the Respondent announced an immediate change at "open meetings of employees[,]" to which the Union was invited; "thereafter, with rare exception," the newly implemented rule was followed; and the incident that the union asserted was the first time that it learned of the new rule "was but a continuation of the open and undisguised enforcement of this rule." 20 FLRA at 52. Similar circumstances are not present here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the charge was timely filed, and we reverse the Judge's dismissal of the amended complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 55 FLRA 43, 46 (1998) (ULP charge is timely if filed within six months of the time that properly designated union representatives received notice of or discovered a change in working conditions); <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l INS Council, Local 2076</span>, 43 FLRA 241, 249 (1991) (applying the rule that by failing to notify the union of a change in working conditions, the agency's failure to perform its duty prevented the filing of a ULP charge within the prescribed time).</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on legislative history, FLRA earlier determined that if a ULP is based on a unilateral change in employment conditions, e.g., performance standards, the time for filing the ULP runs from the date of the change, not from the date the union was or should have been actually notified of the change, assuming that management had not acted to prevent the charging party from learning of the changes through concealment of the changes or through "failure to perform a duty" that prevented the discovery of the ULP. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lyons and AFGE Local 1012</span>, 24 FLRA 255, 269-70 (1986) (ALJ Decision). If the ULP charge is based on a refusal to bargain, it may become important, for purposes of determining the filing period, to determine at what level of an agency bargaining responsibility was placed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FAA and NATCA</span>, 52 FLRA 548, 552 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">The six-month limitation period barred a charge of failure to bargain over a change in dress code when the change was announced by supervisors at open meetings of employees in November, the union was invited to have a representative attend those meetings, the rule was then consistently enforced, and the ULP charge was not filed until the following July. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 222</span>, 20 FLRA 51, 52 (1985). A ULP charge concerning the denial of reimbursement by the agency of expenses incurred during negotiations is timely if it is filed within six months of the reimbursement request. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 14 FLRA 191, 192 (1984). The charge is timely even though it references matters that occurred before the six-month period if the operative events leading to the ULP complaint occurred within the proper filing period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Flight Test Ctr., Edwards AFB and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 55 FLRA 116, 120 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a ULP charge is effectively withdrawn and another is filed stating a ULP charge regarding a different unit of recognition, the first charge does not toll the six-month limitation period; the amendment does not reach back in time to the date the first charge was filed. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE</span>, 4 FLRA 787, 794-95 (1980) (ALJ Decision). There are circumstances that allow successively filed ULPs to toll the six-month period. The ULP charges should be closely related, concern the same unit, and should demonstrate vigorous pursuit by the union of its rights, e.g., enforcement of an arbitration award. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 24 FLRA 1021, 1026 (1986). Amended charges that are closely related to events or matters complained of in the charge and that are based on events occurring within the six-month period preceding the charge are not barred by &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A). <span class="Italic">NRC and NTEU</span>, 44 FLRA 370, 379-80 (1992); <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 2250</span>, 42 FLRA 333, 339 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA recognizes that certain violations of the Statute are continuing, e.g., the maintenance and continued enforcement by an agency of a rule barring unit employees from access to the agency's grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 4</span>, 23 FLRA 475, 479 (1986). If an agency rule constitutes an unlawful interference with the right of employees to communicate about union matters, the existence of the rule constitutes a continuing violation for purposes of the six-month limitation period for filing a charge. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 31st Combat Support Group, Homestead AFB and NFFE Local 1167</span>, 13 FLRA 239, 246 n.8 (1983) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey Conservation Div. and AFGE Local 3457</span>, 9 FLRA 543, 553-55 (1982) (ALJ Decision), the ALJ was confronted with the problem of a charge that contained a typographical error concerning the date of the conduct, stated in the charge to have been a year earlier than it occurred. The regional director ignored a motion to dismiss the charge or complaint and amended the complaint to correct the date. The ALJ was required to resolve the difference between 29 USC 160(b) (the NLRA), stating that "no complaint shall issue based upon any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board," and <span id="page_1559"></span>5 USC 7118(a)(4)(A) of the Reform Act, providing that "no complaint shall be issued based on any <span class="Italic">alleged</span> unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge." The problem, as the ALJ saw it, was that under the NLRA the only material date was the date of the event leading to the charge. Under the Reform Act, the injection of "alleged" could be construed to mean that the allegation rather than the date of the conduct controlled, meaning that if the allegation was defective, it could not properly support a complaint. After considerable discussion of the legislative history, the ALJ decided that the injection of the word "alleged" was improvident and would be ignored to avoid a result inconsistent with the congressional intent. FLRA accepted his analysis.</p>
