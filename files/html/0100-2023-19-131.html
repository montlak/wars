<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-127"><span class="space">c.</span> Less Serious Conduct: Concurrent Rehabilitation, Discipline</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board extended <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> in <span class="Italic">Simms v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 308, 312 n.3 (1988), when it determined that an agency's decision to mitigate a disciplinary action can satisfy the requirement that it accommodate the disabled employee, as long as the employee is also given a concurrent opportunity for rehabilitation. Also worthy of consideration as accommodation is evidence of mitigation by the agency of prior disciplinary actions against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. VA</span>, 50 MSPR 114, 118 (1991), sustained a suspension (reduced by the agency from a proposed removal) for an individual who received rehabilitation for alcoholism following AWOL charges. The Board declared it appropriate for the agency to permit rehabilitation and concurrently to impose discipline following completion of rehabilitation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he record establishes that the agency offered the appellant a second opportunity for rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, where an agency offers an employee an additional opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation, and the employee successfully completes the program, the agency may not remove him based on conduct that occurred prior to his enrollment in the program. <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 174, 176-77 (1988). In this regard, the Board has emphasized that "the appellant's entitlement to the opportunity to complete treatment and demonstrate acceptable performance rests solely upon the agency's tender and appellant's acceptance of an additional offer of rehabilitation made during the notice period." <span class="Italic">Chaplin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 639, 642 n.1 (1987). Even where the agency has offered the appellant rehabilitation, however, and the appellant has successfully completed a rehabilitation program, the agency may impose a reasonable penalty short of removal. <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 148.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253 (4th Cir. 1989), the appellant, however, contends that the agency could not offer him reasonable accommodation and discipline him at the same time. We find nothing in <span class="Italic">Rodgers</span> to support this conclusion. In <span class="Italic">Rodgers</span>, the employee was removed while, here, the appellant received discipline short of removal. We note that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has approved an agency's use of discipline short of removal while simultaneously affording an employee an opportunity to rehabilitate himself. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Martin</span>, EEOC No. 03910017, slip op. at 7 (Feb. 11, 1991); <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Frank</span>, EEOC No. 03880040, slip op. at 4 (Jan. 8, 1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As an example of concurrent discipline, the Board declined to set aside the result reached by an arbitrator who, in <span class="Italic">Coleman v. VA</span>, 51 MSPR 155, 157-58 (1991), converted a removal into a suspension to last the duration of a rehabilitation program; the arbitration award also appeared to authorize the agency to discipline the appellant if he failed to undergo urinalysis testing and an outpatient treatment program or was involved in future misconduct. The award could not be sustained, consistent with constitutional due process guarantees, to the extent that the award provided that the agency could remove the appellant without notice or appeal rights for violating the conditions of his reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions noting that rehabilitation can be a component of mitigation do not require rehabilitation efforts for an individual who uses drugs on agency property and who does not seek rehabilitation until after the misconduct is discovered. <span class="Italic">Horne v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> CB-7121-10-0002-V-1 (NP 11/18/2010), explained during Board review of an arbitration award sustaining removal of a plastic fabricator charged with possession of illegal drugs (marijuana) on agency property and use of illegal drugs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time in his request for review, the appellant argues that the agency discriminated against him by failing to accommodate his disability--in particular that he was removed despite the fact that he entered a rehabilitation program after the drug test, had tested "clean" repeatedly since then, and had graduated from the program only a week after he was removed. The agency responds that the claim is baseless because recreational use of illegal drugs is not a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must prove his discrimination claim by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 15. To establish a claim of discrimination based upon a failure to accommodate, the appellant must first prove that he is a qualified person with a disability--a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of his position with or without a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paris v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 24 (2006). "Disability" is defined as a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1). To prevail in a failure to accommodate case, an appellant must also have requested an accommodation while employed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17. A mere assertion of discrimination, without more, is insufficient to constitute a showing of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Gray v. General Services Administration</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 13 (2008). Here, in light of the show cause orders regarding discrimination issued to the parties on review and their subsequent responses, we find no further proceedings are necessary to complete the record on this issue, and it is ripe for our review. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 9 (2010) (if there are no disputed issues of material fact, a discrimination claim may be resolved without a hearing);<span class="Italic"> Redd v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 13 (2006) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "qualified individual with a disability" does not include any employee who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the agency acts on the basis of such use. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(a); <span class="Italic">Burton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2009); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.3(a). But this exclusion does not apply to an individual who has successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program and is no longer using drugs or an individual participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and not currently using drugs. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant appears to have successfully completed a rehabilitation program shortly after his removal and repeatedly tested drug free during the program, he does not meet one of the exceptions in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(b) because he did not enroll in the rehabilitation program until after the agency caught him committing the misconduct at issue. It is well-settled discrimination law that, as a matter of policy, persons disciplined for current drug use are not permitted to invoke the protection of the Americans with Disabilities Act simply by showing an "after-the-fact" rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">Lea v. Department of the Treasury</span>, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Petition No. 03970018 (July 31, 1997) (finding that although the petitioner completed drug rehabilitation prior to the agency's March 1996 removal decision, the agency's decision was based upon the petitioner's drug use during June to September 1995, and her subsequent rehabilitation did not thereafter bar the agency from taking an adverse action against her for drug use during that time); <span class="Italic">see Fitzgerald v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03970065 (June 27, 1997) (during the acts of misconduct leading to the petitioner's removal, the petitioner was "currently engaging in the use of illegal drugs," and therefore was not an individual with a disability, despite his later enrollment in a drug treatment program); <span id="Page_3553"></span><span class="Italic">Little v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 574, 583 (1995) (adopting the EEOC's determination that policy concerns dictate that individuals disciplined for drug use may not be permitted to invoke the Rehabilitation Act's protections simply by showing they were rehabilitated "after-the-fact"); <span class="Italic">see also Adams</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 17 (finding the appellant failed to show entitlement to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act where the record did not show he met any of the criteria of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(b) prior to the date his removal was proposed or effected).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant has not even attempted to identify any impairment that limits one or more of his major life activities. <span class="Italic">See Vena</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 13 (the disability claim failed because nothing in the record even suggested an impairment of a major life activity). Further, his long tenure successfully performing a dangerous job suggests he has no such impairments. <span class="Italic">See generally Alford v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 15 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 361 F. App'x 131 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Thus, the appellant has failed to raise any issues of material fact that support his claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Burton</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 15 (to prevail on a disability claim, the appellant must first prove that he is disabled). Lastly, even if the appellant had shown that he was disabled, his claim would fail because he never requested any accommodation from the agency. <span class="Italic">See Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Criminal activity does not always foreclose accommodation. An appellant fired for AWOL following his incarceration for a DWI-related offense was ordered reinstated. The agency refused LWOP. Although the Board's opinion does not provide detailed analysis, it appears that the agency may have failed to accommodate the appellant by granting LWOP after the appellant entered into rehabilitation while he was still employed with the agency. The agency did not contest that the appellant was a qualified disabled employee. <span class="Italic">Faber v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 315, 319 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although there may be employees who cannot be provided accommodation as a result of the sensitive nature of their work, the Board does not completely defer to an agency's evaluation of the nature of the job. The Board balances the nature of the job against the realistic possibility of accommodation. Following <span class="Italic">Haskins v. FAA</span>, 21 MSPR 507, 508-09 (1984), concluding that when an agency allows an employee to enter rehabilitation, it implicitly agrees to permit him the opportunity to complete the program and demonstrate rehabilitation prior to instituting adverse action, <span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 29 MSPR 118, 120-21 (1985), determined that the agency failed to accommodate a Border Patrol agent discharged for being under the influence of intoxicants on duty, damaging a government vehicle, and being convicted of driving while intoxicated. Immediately after the accident, the employee entered into a rehabilitation program, presented evidence of a favorable prognosis, and was granted sick leave to attend alcohol abuse counseling. Despite the nature of the appellant's work, requiring use of a firearm, the agency erred by failing to provide the accommodation of allowing him to conclude his rehabilitation and to demonstrate rehabilitative success before taking adverse action. The appellant was retained in duty status for about three months after his accident. The agency knew of his disabling condition before it proposed his removal. <span class="Italic">Marren</span> also cited <span class="Italic">Velie v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 26 MSPR 376, 378 (1985), and <span class="Italic">Keels v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 19, 21 (1981). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Weinberger</span>, 600 F. Supp. 757 (D.D.C. 1985) ("In a disciplinary context...'reasonable accommodation' of an alcoholic employee requires forgiveness of his past alcohol-induced misconduct in proportion to his willingness to undergo and favorable response to treatment."); <span class="Italic">Chaplin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 639, 642 (1987) (once an employee responds to an agency offer of assistance by enrolling in a rehabilitation program, the agency must provide the employee with a reasonable period of time to demonstrate success before taking adverse action); <span class="Italic">Corral v.

USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 80, 80-81 n.* (1986) (removal action based on misconduct that occurred prior to a settlement agreement and that related to the appellant's substance abuse problem was improper when the appellant was performing successfully in a rehabilitation program (citing<span class="Italic"> Keels v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 118, 122-24 (1984) (reasonable for the agency to wait four months after treatment for the appellant to demonstrate rehabilitative success; the agency could not fulfill a rehabilitative obligation, however, by relying on absences preceding rehabilitation; removal was sustained on the record of current absences and the failure to supply medical documentation explaining absences); <span class="Italic">Lundy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 469, 473 (1982) (removal of equipment cleaner at naval shipyard: "Implicit in this action by the agency is its willingness to give appellant a 'reasonable opportunity for rehabilitation.' <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Felten v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Felten v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 7 MSPR 499, 500, 7 MSPB 356 (1981), provides an example of insufficient accommodation extended to a safety specialist with OSHA who committed misconduct, entered rehabilitation at the urging of the agency, completed the program, and was then fired:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During approximately two years prior to appellant's removal, agency officials informed appellant of the existence of alcohol rehabilitation programs available to him and suggested that he attend one of these programs. It was not until the appellant received a notice of proposed removal, however, that he decided to enroll in such a program. At the oral reply the appellant's representative requested that a decision on the action be stayed while appellant attempted to rehabilitate himself through attendance in this program. The deciding official agreed to this and appellant was given advance sick leave to attend the program. The appellant entered and completed the four week rehabilitation program and apparently returned to the job after completion of the program. Nonetheless, three weeks later he was removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide whether the agency's prior encouragement of appellant to attend a rehabilitation program satisfied its obligation to reasonably accommodate his condition. <span class="Italic">See Ruzek v. General</span> <span class="Italic">Services Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 307, 7 MSPR 437 (1981). Whatever the extent of the agency's previous efforts, it is clear that the agency promised to forestall action as long as appellant was seriously attempting rehabilitation and, by necessary implication, agreed that it was reasonable to allow appellant this opportunity to conquer his problem. There is no evidence that after appellant completed the four week program he resumed drinking, and any speculation that he might would not be a proper basis for removal on this record. While there were some negative aspects to the summary report of appellant's participation in the program, there was nothing upon which it could be conclusively said that appellant would not continue his abstinence. Moreover, the agency's deciding official testified that he gave little or no weight to the report of appellant's participation in the rehabilitation program. Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to fulfill the obligation which it undertook to allow appellant a reasonable opportunity for rehabilitation. By proceeding with the removal action notwithstanding appellant's continuing rehabilitation attempt, and notwithstanding the absence of any evidence that appellant's attempt had failed, the agency arbitrarily withdrew the accommodation. We conclude that the agency thereby committed the prohibited personnel practice of handicap discrimination....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Until <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135 (1988), discussed earlier, discipline was not part of the accommodative process. The Board cases were consistent on this point. Progressive discipline and warnings were not a reasonable accommodation without an opportunity for rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">Swafford v. TVA</span>, 18 MSPR 481, 483 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Friel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 216, 218-19 (1985) (agency improperly demoted a police officer to an unarmed position before he completed rehabilitation; the agency was incorrect in its conclusion that the armed nature of the appellant's position precluded accommodation); <span class="Italic">Booth v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 353, 356 (1984) (agency's decision to mitigate a suspension did not satisfy the requirement that the agency accommodate the appellant by allowing him the opportunity to take sick leave for rehabilitation treatment before initiating the disciplinary action).</p>
