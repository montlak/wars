<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-100"><span class="space">a.</span> Effect of Collective Bargaining Contract; Agency Regulation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pogarsky v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 7 MSPR 196, 198, 7 MSPB 109 (1981), involved an appellant who contended that her probationary termination was invalid because the agency breached a provision of its collective bargaining agreement requiring the agency to meet, on request, with an employee whose termination was proposed. Although a collective bargaining agreement can increase the procedural entitlements of a probationary employee terminated for preemployment or postemployment reasons beyond those provided by 5 CFR Part 315, those additional safeguards do not become extensions of OPM regulations; the negotiated provisions are benefits accruing outside the appeal right provided by 5 CFR 315.806 (2022). Compliance with those additional procedural entitlements is enforced only through the negotiated grievance procedure. To hold otherwise would permit the parties to a collective agreement to create a basis for the Board's jurisdiction not authorized by statute, rule, or regulation. An agreement between the agency and its employees cannot confer jurisdiction on the Board. The Board's review of improper procedures involved in probationary terminations based on preemployment reasons is limited to a review of compliance with 5 CFR 315.805 (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. MSP</span>B, 484 Fed. Appx. 561, 562-63 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP) ("On appeal to this court, Ms. Wilson does not contend that her termination was due to partisan political reasons or her marital status. Instead, she argues that her termination violated a collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the National Treasury Employees Union. An allegation of conflict with a collective bargaining agreement, however, does not give the Board jurisdiction to review a probationer's removal. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 813 F.2d 1216, 1218-19 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ('Ordinarily a collective bargaining agreement cannot confer jurisdiction on the board if the employee would not otherwise have the right to appeal to the board.'); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Vernon v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 58 Fed. Appx. 472, 473-74 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ('The Board correctly concluded that it had no jurisdiction to reach the merits of any of [appellant's] claims, including...the claims based on collective bargaining agreements.')."), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span>. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DA-0752-11-0276-I-1 (NP 1/20/2012) (denying jurisdiction in a probationary termination appeal: "Moreover, to the extent the appellant alleges a procedural error that was in violation of a negotiated agreement, it is well settled that an agreement between an agency and its employees simply cannot serve to confer jurisdiction on the Board."); <span class="Italic">McLean v. VA</span>, DC-315H-16-0900-I-1 (NP 4/21/2022) (jurisdictional issue concerning termination of excepted service appointee with less than a year of service: "the appellant's Board appeal rights are determined by the nature of her appointment--not by contract. Therefore, alleged violations of the collective bargaining agreement are irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue"); <span class="Italic">Dominczak v. DOD</span>, AT-315H-15-0029-I-1 (NP 5/6/2015) (probationary termination: "Thus, despite the appellant's discussion of the grievance and performance-based action procedures outlined in the collective bargaining agreement, any such contractual provisions do not affect her appeal rights."); <span class="Italic">Mitskog v. FEC</span>, DC-0752-14-0478-I-1 (NP 1/26/2015) (agency's letter stating the appellant had Board appeal rights based on a collective bargaining contract providing a one-year probation period did not confer Board jurisdiction: "The appellant's argument that the agency waived the jurisdictional requirements through additional procedural safeguards that were provided in the Labor Management Agreement is also without merit. We note that the agency's termination letter provided the appellant with Board appeal rights. However, the agency cannot confer Board jurisdiction where jurisdiction does not otherwise exist. <span class="Italic">Waldrop v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 12, 15 (1996). Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction, regardless of additional rights provided in the agreement or mistakenly provided with the termination letter.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fall v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), determined that a probationer's termination is treated as such despite rights under labor agreements or performance issues usually addressed under Chapter 43 procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 26, 2020, the agency appointed Mr. Fall to a career-conditional competitive service position as a Contact Representative for the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). The appointment was subject to completion of a one-year probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 30, 2021, the agency informed Mr. Fall that he needed to improve his performance to avoid an unsuitability determination and placed him on a performance action plan. On September 28, 2021, after concluding that Mr. Fall had not improved his performance sufficiently, the agency issued a notice of termination based on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804, which concerns termination of probationary employees for unsatisfactory performance or conduct. Mr. Fall's termination was effective October 1, 2021, which was during his one-year probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 1, 2021, Mr. Fall appealed to the Board, contending "that the procedures used in making the determination [that he be terminated] were unfair and unjust based on the circumstances and final outcome." In an order, the administrative judge informed Mr. Fall that the Board may lack jurisdiction because probationers in the competitive service with less than one year of non-temporary current continuous service have limited rights to appeal. Mr. Fall did not respond to the administrative judge's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 1, 2021, the administrative judge issued her initial decision, dismissing Mr. Fall's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On December 6, 2021, that decision became the final decision of the Board. Mr. Fall timely appealed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is limited to appeals based on a "law, rule, or regulation" that provides an employee with an appeal right. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a); <span class="Italic">see also Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two statutory provisions and one regulation are relevant to determining if Mr. Fall has such a right. First, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) permits an employee to appeal a removal taken to promote the efficiency of the service. Second, <span id="Page_146"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(e) permits an employee to appeal a removal based on unacceptable performance. But neither statute grants any appeal rights to removed probationary employees in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(f)(2), 7511(a)(1)(A). Third, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806 permits a probationary employee to appeal a termination based on &#x00A7; 315.804 or &#x00A7; 315.805. Section 315.804 concerns termination of probationers for unsatisfactory performance or conduct. Section 315.805 concerns termination of probationers for conditions arising before appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether the termination was based on &#x00A7; 315.804 or &#x00A7; 315.805, an appeal under &#x00A7; 315.806 is possible only if (1) the employee alleges her termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status or (2) the agency proposed to terminate the probationary employee for reasons based in whole or in part on conditions arising before her employment and the agency failed to follow the procedural requirements of &#x00A7; 315.805 (which include notice of proposed adverse action, opportunity to respond, and notice of any adverse decision). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.806, 315.804, 315.805.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the Board properly dismissed Mr. Fall's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. None of Mr. Fall's arguments persuade us otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Mr. Fall contends that the Board violated &#x00A7; 315.804, by failing to notify him in writing as to why he was being terminated and the effective date of termination. According to Mr. Fall, the agency instead subjected him to "various vague and confusing criticisms such as you're not 'cut out' for this job and 'you won't be around' before being plac[ing him] on an invalid and illegal performance improvement plan."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as outlined above, Mr. Fall's appeal rights are limited by &#x00A7; 315.806, which permits a probationary employee to appeal certain termination decisions to the Board only if the employee alleges (1) discrimination based on partisan political reasons or marital status or (2) violation of the procedural requirements of &#x00A7; 315.805, which concerns termination based in whole or in part on pre-appointment conditions. There is no indication in the record of any such discrimination or termination based on any pre-appointment conditions. As a result, the Board correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction here.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Moreover, if we were to address this argument on the merits, Mr. Fall's submissions to this Court indicate that the agency provided him with a letter indicating why he was being terminated and the effective date of his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Fall contends that he should be constructively classified as an employee and that his placement on a performance improvement plan violated &#x00A7; 315.804. Citing the Office of Personnel Management's ("OPM") website, Mr. Fall asserts that such plans are not appropriate for probationers because the entire probationary period is a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> performance improvement plan. Mr. Fall contends that the performance improvement plan subjected him to an additional layer of scrutiny, which made his job more difficult and permitted management to build a stronger case for termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, Mr. Fall's arguments run afoul of &#x00A7; 315.806, which limits a terminated probationary employee's right to appeal to specific scenarios not present here. Mr. Fall's arguments cannot provide jurisdiction where it is otherwise lacking. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) (requiring appealable action be based on "law, rule, or regulation").[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Even if the Board had jurisdiction, the website at issue detracts from Mr. Fall's position. It confirms that an agency need not afford a probationary employee any opportunity to improve but that such employees "should receive closer supervision, instruction, and training as needed." <span class="Italic">See Frequently Asked Questions: Employee Relations, Response to Do I Have to Give a Probationary/Trial Employee an Opportunity to Improve?</span>, OPM (last visited June 6, 20 22), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/faqs/topic/employeerelations/index.aspx">https://www.opm.gov/faqs/topic/employeerelations/index.aspx</a>. That is precisely what occurred here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Mr. Fall contends that his situation was governed by Article 40 of the National Agreement between the National Treasury Employees Union ("NTEU") and the IRS. Collective bargaining agreements, such as the National Agreement, ordinarily cannot confer Board jurisdiction that is otherwise lacking. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smith v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 813 F.2d 1216, 1218-19 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also Wilson v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 484 F. App'x 561, 562-63 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding Board lacked jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 315.806 and rejecting appellant's reliance on NTEU collective bargaining agreement for jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fourth, Mr. Fall argues that the Board improperly dismissed based on Title 5, Chapter 75 of the U.S. Code. Mr. Fall contends that the National Agreement governs his situation and provides that Title 5, Chapter 43 controls. However, as mentioned above, the result would have been the same had the Board evaluated Chapter 43. Both Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 narrowly define an "employee" to exclude a probationary employee, such that a probationary employee has no statutory right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7511(a)(1)(A), 4303(e), (f)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A problem with protections for probationers through negotiated agreements is they may be unenforceable as a result of the law developed by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that arbitrators lack jurisdiction over grievances directly challenging probationers' terminations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS v. FLRA</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 726-29 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("The substantial protections that Congress made available only to tenured employees indicate that Congress recognized and approved of the inextricable link between the effective operation of the probationary period and the agency's right to summary termination. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 45."); <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 3342</span>, 14 FLRA 164, 164-65 (1984) ("In the Immigration and Naturalization Service case, the court held that coverage under a negotiated grievance procedure of a grievance concerning the separation of a probationary employee is precluded by governing law and regulation. Thus, in terms of this case, the Authority concludes that the award, both by finding the grievance arbitrable and by resolving the grievance on the merits and ordering the grievant reinstated with backpay, is deficient in its entirety as contrary to the statutory and regulatory scheme set forth in 5 U.S.C. 3321 and 5 CFR part 315, subpart H."). [Refer to Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Labor Relations Authority Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/22FLRA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc. 2023</a>), Chapter 6, "Probationary, Term or Temporary, and NAF Employees," and the subsection in Chapter 9, "Grievances by Terminated Probationers or Individuals Who Do Not Meet the Statutory Definition of an 'Employee.'"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency regulations do not appear to provide greater protection to employees than do the OPM regulations defining probation, <span class="Italic">Knox v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3218):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Knox's first contention in this appeal is that the provisions of AFR 40-452 require a probationary employee's supervisor to make a written certification of the probationer's performance not later than the tenth month of probation; that his supervisor failed to make the required certification within the 10-month period, and, therefore, that his probationary period ended on the tenth month of his employment, thus giving him the right to appeal to the MSPB pursuant to 5 USC 4303(f)(2). We reject this argument on the ground that there is nothing in the Air Force regulation which confers career conditional status upon a probationary employee, merely because his supervisor failed to make the required certification within the 10-month period. His probationary period was one year, not ten months, regardless of when he received the certification from his supervisor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bode v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 133, 134 (1982) (although the FPM called for certification of the probationer's performance at or after the ninth month of employment, the FPM provision was not to be interpreted as preventing or discouraging a removal action for unsatisfactory performance during the probation).
