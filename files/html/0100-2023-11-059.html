<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-60"><span class="space">c.</span> Sworn Written Statement; Form of Attestation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Affidavits are often encountered when the agency submits its response to the appeal. The investigation file that forms part of the response can include sworn statements or affidavits. Depositions--written transcriptions of sworn verbal testimony--are often taken after the appeal and response have been filed but before the hearing. Depositions are taken "subject to penalties for intentional false statements," 5 CFR 1201.75 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Taking depositions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Depositions may be taken by any method agreed upon by the parties. The person providing information is subject to penalties for intentional false statements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 18 USC 1001:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to <span id="Page_1485"></span>contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic terrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. If the matter relates to an offense under chapter 109A, 109B, 110, or 117, or section 1591, then the term of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be not more than 8 years.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The party taking the deposition may then <span class="Italic">seek</span> to enter it into the appeal as an exhibit with the prehearing submission. [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-250.html#sec2-247">Deposition</a>," for guidance on MSPB deposition practice.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An affidavit or deposition is a sworn statement made outside a hearing room. The threat of a perjury conviction or the moral obligation of an oath, it is believed, makes these statements more probative than those that are unsworn. The use of affidavits or sworn statements is significant. They constitute evidence when they are appended to the appeal or included with the agency response to the appeal. The hearing then becomes an opportunity for one party to rebut the other's sworn statements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An affidavit is a statement that is executed before a notary public. The notary signs a statement to the effect that the affiant swore to and signed the statement in the presence of the notary. As to the significance of a notary's certification, <span class="Italic">Kelsey v. OPM</span>, DC-0831-09-0804-I-1 (NP 12/10/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">..."the well-established rule that to overcome the presumption arising from [a notary's] certificate there must be proof of gross concurrent mistake or fraud, through strong and disinterested evidence." <span class="Italic">Marden v. Hopkins</span>, 47 App. D.C. 202, 206-07 (D.C. 1918). Thus, the appellant has failed to rebut the notary's certificate, which is <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> proof of the evidence that it contains. <span class="Italic">See Ford v. Ford</span>, 27 App. D.C. 401, 408 (D.C. 1906).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 28 USC 1746, unsworn statements made under penalty of perjury are considered the equivalent of affidavits. <span class="Italic">Donato v. DOD</span>, 34 MSPR 385, 389 (1987). Section 1746 provides:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's appeal form, at block 12, the signature block, contains the statement the statement "I certify that all of the statements made in this form and any attachments are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief." The statements provided by the appellant may or may not constitute sworn evidence, depending on how those statements are presented to the Board. If the appeal is signed by the appellant rather than only by a designated representative, under some circumstances the statements in the appeal may be considered sworn, <span class="Italic">Edem v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 64 MSPR 501, 505 n.5 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims in her petition for review that her allegations of marital status discrimination were sworn, as they were contained in an attachment to a Merit Systems Protection Board appeal form, which contains a statement that "I certify that all of the statements made in this appeal are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief." While the appeal form does contain this statement, we note that the statements therein are neither sworn under oath nor made under penalty of perjury. We further note that the certification was signed by the appellant's representative, not by the appellant personally.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge mistakenly refers to the appellant's statements in his submissions as unsworn. The appellant's submissions were e-filed. With each document that is e-filed, the question is asked "Do you declare, under penalty of perjury, that the facts stated in this pleading are true and correct." Thus, all of the statements that the appellant made asserting facts that he knew from his personal knowledge and that he e-filed are sworn statements. We find that the administrative judge's error does not affect the outcome of this case. In any event, we have considered the statements as sworn in making our decision.</p>

But, under current Board regulations, sworn statements appear to be required to establish jurisdiction when jurisdiction is in dispute.

<p class="Body-Text">Sworn statements are often included in the agency's record supplied with its response to the appeal. An appellant may also include affidavits or sworn statements with the appeal that initiates her case with the Board. As to affidavits offered during the hearing phase of the case, section 14.a.(2) of Chapter 10 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> states of affidavits and depositions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Affidavits and depositions may be accepted into evidence at a hearing, despite objections, upon a reasonable showing by the offering party of the unavailability of the affiant to testify. There is generally no need to play recorded or videotaped depositions at the hearing unless one of the parties wishes the AJ to rule on an objection made at the deposition.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Affidavits or statements present problems because they are selective as to content and because, as hearsay, they are not subject to cross-examination. They are frequently prepared by investigators or lawyers who may believe their job is to support a case against the employee. The statements may be signed by employees who fear reprisal from, or desire to curry the favor of, supervisors or managers known to be anxious to rid themselves of the nettlesome appellant. The potential for abuse is apparent. The subject of <span id="Page_1486"></span>witness coercion was addressed in <span class="Italic">Bonet v. USPS</span>, 712 F.2d 213, 217 (5th Cir. 1983), including the comments of a dissenting judge about affidavits offered in adverse action cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I accept those affidavits at face value, although I must comment it is very difficult for an employee not to give such an affidavit when confronted with a superior who indicates that he or she is trying to build a case against an employee for this particular kind of misconduct....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affidavits should not displace live testimony if the affidavits were retracted or contradicted by the witnesses who made them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. DLA</span>, 22 MSPR 10, 13 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Walls v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 274, 278 (1982)). An appellant's affidavit may carry less weight if the appellant decided not to have a hearing and present testimony subject to cross-examination on its content, <span class="Italic">Potosky v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-09-0957-I-2 (NP 1/11/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During proceedings before the administrative judge, the appellant withdrew his request for a hearing. He relied on his affidavit, which is hearsay evidence, to show that he did not take a microphone speaker amp from a postal customer. The Board assesses the weight to be given hearsay evidence under <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 83, 87 (1981). Applying the <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> criteria to the appellant's affidavit, its value is diminished because he was available to testify at a hearing, but chose not to do so, and is not a disinterested witness as his employment was at stake. Further, his account is inconsistent with other evidence in the case. The appellant asserts that he did not take a microphone speaker amp from a postal customer and that what he took was trash. However, there is nothing in the record to corroborate the appellant's assertion, including the arresting officer's affidavit. The appellant had the opportunity to clarify any discrepancy in the affidavit through the testimony of the officer, who the administrative judge approved as a witness for the appellant, before the appellant withdrew his hearing request. If the Board were to assess the appellant's credibility as the declarant of the affidavit under <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987), his credibility would be weak for reasons similar to those that diminish the value of the affidavit under the <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> criteria, notably, his bias on his own behalf and the contradiction of his version of events by other evidence or record. <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 458.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affidavits have limited reliability if they are made to agency investigators outside of the presence of the appellant or agency representative. <span class="Italic">Walls v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 274, 278 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Washington v. USDA</span>, 10 MSPR 465, 470 (1982) ("We would add that even though the agency apparently did not attempt to obtain the witnesses, transcript evidence was preferable even to a sworn affidavit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kowal v. United States</span>, 412 F.2d 867, 873 ([Ct. Cl.] 1969)."). A party should not be sanctioned for producing an affidavit rather than a witness whom the party stated would be produced at a hearing, but the weight of the affidavit may be diminished if a sufficient reason is not provided for the absence of the witness and if there are other, notable circumstances, e.g., the affidavit was not witnessed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 173, 177 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the use of affidavits in a Board hearing is proper if the material is probative and its use is fundamentally fair, <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. MSPB</span> (9th Cir. 1981 NP No. 80-7132), the Board cautioned that before an entire case is presented through affidavits, it should be understood that judgment will not follow the numbers of affidavits on disputed sides of an issue; rather it is the quality of the experience demonstrated by the affidavits that determines the outcome on issues of performance and behavior of an employee. <span class="Italic">In re Kass</span>, 2 MSPR 79, 100, 2 MSPB 251, 269 (1980). The Federal Circuit noted the limited value of notarized statements when the individual whose knowledge is recorded is not produced as a witness, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 208 Fed. Appx. 854, 856 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Credibility determinations, in particular, are within the trial judge's discretion and are "virtually unreviewable" on appeal. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Frey v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Contemporaneous written records and the testimony of multiple witnesses support the agency's position, notwithstanding Ms. Brown's submitted testimony to the contrary. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the AJ's findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not abuse her discretion in according little weight to the notarized letter from the alleged witness, given that Ms. Brown refused to identify or produce the witness for cross-examination. Ms. Brown argues that the notary who notarized the letter should have been allowed to testify in lieu of the witness. Such evidentiary decisions fall within the sound discretion of the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988). This Court will not overturn the Board on such matters unless an abuse of discretion is clear and harmful. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If an abuse of discretion did occur, in order for Ms. Brown to prevail on these issues she must prove that the error caused substantial harm or prejudice to her rights which could have affected the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 657-59 (1985); <span class="Italic">Curtin</span>, 846 F.2d at 1379.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the notary would only have provided an attestation to the signature and not to any of the facts contained in the letter. Any testimony to the facts would be hearsay. Accordingly, the AJ did not err by refusing to allow the notary to testify. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> Fed. R. Evid. 602 advisory committee's note (longstanding rule requiring witness to have personal knowledge of a matter and preventing witness without personal knowledge "from testifying to the subject matter of the hearsay statement").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 97 MSPR 282, 286-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2004), evaluated the evidentiary weight of conflicting unsworn and sworn declarations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's statements in his pleadings are not evidence. <span class="Italic">See McClendon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 250 &#x00B6; 12 (2002); <span class="Italic">but see Geier v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 186 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2001) (an appellant's certified statement in his petition for appeal that he never received. The agency's proposal letter was sufficient to rebut the presumption that the agency's sealed, properly addressed, and properly mailed proposal letter reached the appellant in due course of the mails). Additionally, the statements in the petition for appeal are not sworn, despite the fact that the appellant certified that they are true. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edem v. Department of Commerce</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 501, 505 n.5 (1994) (the mere fact that an appellant signed the certification statement on the Board's appeal form does not mean that the statements in the petition for appeal are sworn under oath or made under penalty of perjury). Further, the appellant's statement regarding what the secretary allegedly told management is unsworn, uncorroborated hearsay and, as such, is entitled to little weight. <span class="Italic">See Wallace v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 178 &#x00B6; 15 (2001), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 41 Fed. Appx. 455 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Finally, while the statement from the appellant's sister included the words "I, Lynne Powers, hereby duly swear," the statement is not notarized, signed under penalty of perjury, signed under oath, or otherwise "sworn" in any traditional legal sense. Thus, the Board will not consider it to be a sworn statement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 263 (1998) (suggesting that, for a statement to be sworn, it must be under oath); Black's Law Dictionary 1416 (7th ed. 1999) ("sworn statement" means "[a] statement given under oath; an affidavit"). The fact that none of these statements was sworn detracts from their weight and probative value. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 211, 228 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The four sworn affidavits submitted by the agency are consistent in identifying the voice on the voicemail as the appellant's. The statements also comport with the fact that the appellant would have had a motive to threaten Robinette, if he knew that Robinette had disclosed the appellant's involvement in the gambling operation to the agency and the police. The Board finds these sworn statements, made under penalty of perjury, to be more persuasive than the unsworn statements and wholly unsubstantiated arguments submitted by the appellant regarding this issue. <span class="Italic">See Vercelli v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 322, 327 (1996) (a declaration made under penalty of perjury entitles it to considerable weight, unless it is rebutted);<span class="Italic"> Social Security Administration v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 684, 692 (1993) (a sworn statement has greater weight than one that is unsworn), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 39 F.3d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 514 U.S. 1063 (1995). Therefore, the agency has proven Charge II by a preponderance of the evidence. That charge is sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may be required to weigh conflicting statements, and the Board can technically evaluate the format of written statements offered into evidence. The more formal the declaration--the more closely the statement follows an affidavit format--the more weight the Board gives the critical substance of the statement when there are conflicts among written submissions. In <span class="Italic">Haebe v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 167, 173 &#x00B6; 10 &#x0026; n.1 (1999), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 288 F.3d 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2002), involving an issue of interim relief, the appellant's statement to the Board included the following assertion: "I hereby certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true. I am aware that if any of the foregoing statements made by me are willfully false, I am subject to punishment." The Board's evaluation of the certification was that it constituted an unsworn statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's "certification" is not a sworn affidavit or a declaration made under penalty of perjury. A declaration made under penalty of perjury must at least include the phrase "penalty of perjury" and state that the document is true<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., In re Muscatell,</span> 106 B.R. 307, 309 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1989); <span class="Italic">Edem v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce,</span> 64 MSPR 501, 505 n.5 (1994) (a certification that certain statements are true, complete, and correct is not a sworn statement or a declaration made under penalty of perjury). A declaration made under penalty of perjury is entitled to considerable weight unless rebutted. <span class="Italic">See Vercelli v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 322, 327 (1996). Nevertheless, although the appellant's certification is unsworn and not made under penalty of perjury, it is still admissible hearsay evidence. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of Justice,</span> 69 MSPR 211, 228 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 99 F.3d I 1 60 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The form of a declaration was of significance as to proof of OPM approval of an agency appraisal system, <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. USDA</span>, 116 MSPR 331, 339-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17, 2011 MSPB 49 (2011) (Member Rose dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would be proper for the agency to support its contention that OPM approved its November 1995 performance appraisal system with an affidavit or declaration from a credible witness with actual knowledge of the approval. Indeed, probative hearsay evidence may meet the substantial evidence standard. <span class="Italic">Griffin,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 663 n.5, <span class="Italic">citing <span id="Page_1487"></span>Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 77 (1981). The agency provided an "affidavit" by Anita Adkins, senior policy Human Resources Specialist, who states that "[b]y letter dated January 31, 1996, Doris Hausser, Chief Performance Manager and Incentive Awards Division, OPM acknowledged approval of USDA's system." However, Ms. Adkins did not become responsible for the agency's non-SES performance management policy until April 2006, and she plainly was not personally involved in the relevant events of 1995 and 1996.<span class="Italic"></span> Although Ms. Adkins states she reviewed "available files," she does not identify what files were or were <span class="Italic">not</span> available, she does not assert that she personally saw or examined the alleged January 1996 OPM approval letter, nor does she otherwise explain the factual basis for asserting that OPM approved "USDA's [performance management] system" in a letter dated January 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are cognizant that, in appropriate circumstances, an unrebutted affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury may prove the facts it asserts. <span class="Italic">See Schaefer v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 592, 595 (1989) (affidavit); <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 271, 273 (1986) (declaration under penalty of perjury). However, Ms. Adkins's alleged "affidavit" woefully fails to meet the requirements of an affidavit because it was not sworn before a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths. The statement also fails to meet the requirements of a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1746, as it was not signed "under penalty of perjury"; Ms. Adkins's statement merely states: "I hereby declare that the information contained in the above Affidavit is true to the best of my knowledge, information and belief." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1746(2); <span class="Italic">see e.g., Caretolive v. Food &#x0026; Drug Administration,</span> 2011 WL 43646 (6th Cir., January 6, 2011), slip op. at 7. It is therefore nothing more that an unsworn statement, which we find entitled to little weight for the reasons we explain below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although hearsay evidence such as Ms. Adkins's statement may be admissible in Board proceedings, assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 83-87. The Board generally evaluates the probative value of hearsay by considering various factors that include the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing, whether the out-of-court statements were sworn, whether the declarants were disinterested witnesses to the events and whether their statements were routinely made, the consistency of the out-of-court statements with other statements and evidence, whether there is corroboration or contradiction in the record, and the credibility of the out-of-court declarant. <span class="Italic">Vojas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 13 (2011); <span class="Italic">see Social Security Administration v. Long,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-27 (2010) (<span class="Italic">citing Borninkhof,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 87).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Adkins's unsworn statement, identifying no firsthand knowledge of the relevant events and no factual basis to support a claim that OPM had issued a letter in January 1996 approving the agency's November 1995 performance appraisal system, is on its face unreliable hearsay. We have considered the statement in light of the agency's significant, unexplained failure to produce any letter from OPM approving the updated performance appraisal system described in Personnel Bulletin 430-1. Especially also considering that the agency was able to produce OPM approval letters for both the appraisal system that originally covered the appellant and the system in effect after the appellant's removal, we do not find Ms. Adkins's unsworn, unsupported statement to be probative in establishing the requisite OPM approval for the agency's November 1995 appraisal system. Therefore, we give little weight to Ms. Adkins's statement.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Ms. Adkins has identified no personal knowledge of the critical fact she asserts, i.e., OPM approval of the agency's performance appraisal system. She admittedly was not present during the relevant time period, she does not state she has personally <span class="Italic">seen</span> the January 1996 letter, she does not identify any other basis for her to have personal knowledge of this crucial fact, and her statement was not given under oath or in the proper form for a declaration under penalty of perjury. Federal Rules of Evidence 602, providing guidance to the Board, states, in part: "A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter." We therefore give little weight to Ms. Adkins's similarly weak unsworn statement, lacking an adequate description of her personal knowledge. We further note that we have considered Ms. Adkins's unsworn, unsubstantiated assertion that OPM had approved the agency's performance appraisal plan in light of the agency's failure to produce the alleged January 31, 1996 OPM letter of approval, even though the administrative judge below granted the appellant's motion to compel the agency to produce such documentation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the failure of the agency to obtain properly sworn statements, <span class="Italic">Cannon v. DHHS</span>, DA-0752-12-0289-I-1 (NP 11/5/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> factor, whether the statements were signed or in affidavit form and whether anyone witnessed the signing, provides some support for assigning probative value to the statements made by the appellant, Echohawk, and Soxie. All of these statements were signed with similar verifications that they were truthful, but they were not witnessed, sworn before a notary public, or signed under penalty of perjury. Worcester's email, however, was unsigned, unsworn, and contained no verification as to its truthfulness. Therefore, it is entitled to little weight. <span class="Italic">See Adamsen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 15 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> factors 3 and 4 weigh against the probative value of the statements in the record. Specifically, the agency offered no explanation for failing to obtain a sworn statement from Echohawk, Soxie, or Worcester. The appellant did not dispute that Echohawk was a disinterested witness to the events and that his statement was made during an investigation that appears to have been routine. The appellant, however, asserted that Worcester was not a disinterested witness, that he had a personal dispute with him, and that he was a former employee with pending felony charges against him. In addition, Echohawk's statement indicated that the investigation included allegations of misconduct against Worcester and Soxie. Thus, the record does not show that either Worcester or Soxie was a disinterested witness to the events. For his part, the appellant did not give an explanation for failing to submit a sworn statement; however, he did generally state: "I am new at all this business of meetings and write-ups, and my supervisor did not explain in detail what exactly I need to do. I am learning all of this on my own and getting advice from lawyers." In addition, the appellant plainly cannot be deemed a disinterested witness in his appeal. Thus, all of the statements have little probative value under factors 3 and 4.</p>
