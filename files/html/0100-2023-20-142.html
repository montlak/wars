<p class="Body-Text">A covered personnel action may include a decision concerning benefits. 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). Covered benefits include leave<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 247, 252 &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (cancelation of approved leave is a personnel action under the WPA) (on later review, <span class="Italic">Greenspan v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 85 MSPR 631, 641 &#x00B6; 18 (2000) (threat to place an employee on AWOL was a covered personnel action); <span class="Italic">Lawley v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 84 MSPR 253, 259 &#x00B6; 14 (1999) ("Placing an employee in a leave without pay or AWOL status are decisions concerning pay or benefits, and are therefore personnel actions under 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix)"; the appellant should demonstrate that the regulatory requisites for taking leave were met before the Board will assess an argument that its denial resulted from reprisal); <span class="Italic">cf. Staley v. VA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210715117">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP) (FMLA denial in context of whistleblower appeal). A refusal to permit an employee whose removal was proposed to remain in work duty status, as required by 5 CFR 752.404(b)(3), is a personnel action because it is a decision concerning pay or benefits. <span class="Italic">McCollum v. NCUA</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-federal-circuit/1265794.html">417 F.3d 1332</a>, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Ordinarily not covered, unless there is an agency regulation to the contrary, is official time granted for labor relations activities under 5 USC 7131 but not statutorily granted for the preparation of MSPB pleadings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 369, 372-73 (1991) (without a regulatory or statutory authorization, "official time for the appellant to prepare a petition for review to the Board was not a decision concerning benefits"; an agency decision to deny the appellant annual leave was, however, "a decision concerning a benefit").<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 89 MSPR 529, 537-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-20 (2001) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 166 (2002)), concluded that covered personnel actions include the denial of administrative leave, if administrative leave is routinely granted by the agency for personnel in circumstances comparable to those of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Arauz</span> also decided that the denial of sick leave is within the ambit of covered personnel actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Justice,</span> 50 MSPR 369, 373 (1991), the Board found that an agency's denial of a request for annual leave to prepare a petition for review in a Board appeal was a decision concerning a benefit, and that it therefore constituted a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). The Board also found, however, that the agency's denial of a request for official time did not constitute such a decision or personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 372-73. In making these findings, it noted that, while annual leave was a benefit provided by law that accrued automatically, the appellant had failed to show that he was entitled to the official time he had requested. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 373.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the denial of the appellant's request for administrative leave is comparable to the denial of the request in <span class="Italic">Marren</span> for official time. That is, the appellant in this case, like the employee in <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, was asking to be paid, without charge to annual or sick leave, for time spent on matters other than her official duties. The basis for her request was that an anonymous threat had been delivered to her home, and that this threat caused her to be fearful and suffering from emotional stress. The appellant has cited no authority showing that these circumstances entitled her to administrative leave. Moreover, administrative leave, like official time, does not accrue automatically as annual and sick leave do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that a showing that the agency denied a request for administrative leave in circumstances in which it had a general practice of granting such leave would be sufficient to establish the denial of a benefit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(ix). Here, the appellant was not on notice of the need to establish an agency practice of granting administrative leave in the circumstances she relied on in requesting the leave. Further, there appeared to be some confusion regarding whether the appellant was claiming a denial of sick leave, administrative leave, or both. We therefore find that the appellant should be afforded an opportunity on remand to show that there was a general practice of granting administrative leave under the circumstances here....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that the administrative judge failed to address her claim regarding the agency's denial of her sick leave request. In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant's protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the denial of this request, which the agency contended was based on the fact that she had no accrued sick leave it could grant.[6]. He also found that the agency would have taken the personnel actions at issue in the appeal in the absence of the protected disclosures. He did not, however, specifically address the appellant's contention that the agency denied her sick leave request because of her protected disclosures nor did he refer to her allegation that she had accrued sick leave at the time the agency denied her request. Moreover, documents in the record indicate that, near the beginning of the period for which the appellant had requested leave, she accepted, a settlement offer providing for the restoration of 350 hours of sick leave. Thus, the appellant's claim that the agency delayed restoring her sick leave for 6 months after the parties agreed to this settlement is inextricably intertwined with her claim that the agency denied her sick leave because of her disclosures.--On remand, therefore, the administrative judge should address the appellant's allegations regarding the agency's denial of her sick leave request and the effect that the agency's apparent delay in restoring her sick leave had on its denial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Because sick leave, like annual leave, is a benefit that is provided by law and that accrues automatically, we find that a denial of sick leave constitutes a "decision concerning...benefits" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix), that it therefore constitutes a "personnel action" that may be the subject of an IRA appeal, and that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal as it concerns this matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6307; <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Prior to October 29, 1994, the definition of "personnel action" included "any other significant change in duties or responsibilities which is inconsistent with the employee's salary or grade level...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(x) (1988). We find that the described change in duty site was not a change in duties or responsibilities, and therefore, does not constitute a personnel action under the version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(x) that was in effect through October 28, 1994, assuming that that version applies.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">140 Cong. Rec. H11,421 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey). Assuming that the move took place after October 28, 1994, the appellant's mere assertion that he was moved to another location does not, even under a broad interpretation, show a "significant" change in working conditions. The appellant does not say whether other Contract Specialists work outside the base, or whether it is common for Contract Specialists or agency employees generally to be moved from inside the base to outside and vice versa; without more information, we have no way of knowing whether the appellant's move was "significant." Thus, we find, under the circumstances of this case, that the alleged change in duty site does not constitute a personnel action. In addition, "physical pain and emotional stress" are not, in and of themselves, personnel actions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A).</p>
