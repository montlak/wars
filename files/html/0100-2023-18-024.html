<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-25"><span class="space">2.</span> Right to Counsel; Union Representative</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no procedural due process right to counsel during an agency investigation into misconduct, unless there is a custodial interrogation. <span class="Italic">Deatrick v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 10 MSPR 262, 266-67 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0015-I-1 (NP 4/25/2014) ("[A] appellant is not entitled to counsel during the investigatory phase of an administrative proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 229, &#x00B6; 8 (1993)."). <span class="Italic">Cohen v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-12-0427-I-1 (NP 6/19/2014), rejected a right to counsel at administrative investigations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant avers that charge 10, relating to her lack of candor during an investigation, cannot be sustained because she was denied the right to counsel during the interview under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The APA establishes a right to counsel during an "agency proceeding," which is defined exclusively as rule-making, adjudication, and licensing. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551(12), 555(b). It does not create a right to counsel during an investigation. Moreover, as a member of a bargaining unit, the appellant was entitled to be represented by the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2). The record establishes that the appellant was afforded this right and that she exercised it. She has not provided any legal basis for her claim that she was also entitled to counsel and, therefore, we see no basis to disturb the administrative judge's findings under charge 10. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant committed the misconduct charged in all 10 charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Denial of counsel at an investigatory interview, or preclusion of counsel's effective participation at the interview, does not constitute harmful error without a showing that the error (if shown) was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one that it would have reached in the absence of or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Doe v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 493, 499 (2004). [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-148.html#sec4-149">Constitutional and Statutory Challenges</a>," concerning Fifth Amendment issues.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7114(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;the employee requests representation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Each agency shall annually inform its employees of their rights under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Section 7114(a)(2)(B) is derived from private sector labor law, more particularly, from <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251, 256-64 (1975) ("<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right"). [Refer to Chapter 8, "Representation During Formal Discussions" of Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Labor Relations Authority Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/23FLRA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reviewing court declined to set aside a suspension for alleged violation of a contract clause calling for the right to union representation at a meeting that could lead to disciplinary action. The employee failed to demonstrate that, <span id="Page_3149"></span>had the union representative been present, a different result would have been reached. <span class="Italic">Giesler v. MSPB</span>, 686 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1982). <span class="Italic">Howell v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3295), rejected a claim that an employee who was fired after refusing to take a breathalyzer test should be reinstated on the strength of his argument that he had the right to a union representative before the test could be administered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not, and do not, decide whether Howell was entitled to his chosen representative. Violations by the agency of a statute and of a collective bargaining agreement are subject to the harmful error test.... In order to have his removal set aside for harmful procedural error, Howell had to prove, by preponderant evidence, that the alleged error could have affected the outcome of his removal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the presiding official Howell argued that he would have taken the test if he had been given the representative of his choice.... The presiding official did not find Howell's testimony credible. Further the presiding official found that Howell had only two options--he could have taken the test or refused to take the test.... Thus even assuming that the agency erred in not providing Howell the representative of his choice, the conclusion of the presiding official that "appellant has not met his burden of proving harmful procedural error" is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frank v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 35 F.3d 1554, 1558-60 (Fed. Cir. 1994), again declined to set aside a removal based on arguments that union representation was improperly denied during one phase of drug testing procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner next argues that we must overturn his removal because the agency violated his union representation rights. Federal employees enjoy a statutory right to union representation, upon request, at investigatory interviews with agency representatives whenever the employee reasonably believes disciplinary action may result. 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(B) (1988)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, petitioner argues, as he did before the arbitrator, that his union representation rights were violated on January 15, 1993, when an agency Medical Review Officer (MRO) telephoned petitioner to question him about the problem with the specimen. It is undisputed that the MRO telephoned petitioner before he had been advised of his union representation rights. According to petitioner, it was only when the MRO began to question him about the events of December 18, 1992, that he realized the substance of the charges that could possibly be brought against him. At that point, thinking that he needed to speak with a union representative or his manager, petitioner asked the MRO if he could telephone her at a later time. The MRO agreed and the telephone conversation ended. Petitioner then telephoned his union representative. The arbitrator found that, even accepting petitioner's version of the facts, petitioner was not harmed or prejudiced by not having union representation during his brief conversation with the MRO. This finding is supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner was removed for submitting an adulterated specimen. Nothing resulting from the telephone conversation was relied upon by the agency in taking the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner also argues that the Agreement requires that any disciplinary action must be set aside if there has been a violation of the employee's union representation rights. In other words, petitioner argues that the agency contracted away the statutory harmful rule of 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A). Petitioner states that this mandate is in Article 6, Section 2 of the Agreement, which provides "[n]o disciplinary action may result from such meeting unless the provisions of Article have been met." We disagree with petitioner. We interpret Section 2 as providing that evidence (for example, an admission) obtained at a meeting where an employee's union representation rights are violated cannot be used against the employee. In this case, the only relevant evidence relied upon by the agency (other than evidence that was favorable, to petitioner) was the adulterated specimen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, petitioner's arguments regarding union representation also do not warrant reversal of the arbitrator's Decision and Award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Boyd v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-0752-10-0914-I-1 (NP 9/30/2011) ("Nevertheless, even if the appellant was entitled to union representation and the agency somehow prevented her from receiving such representation, she must show that this would have had an outcome-determinative effect on her case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Simmons v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Loveland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 554, 557-58 (1988), considered the argument that, had she been advised by a union representative, an employee would have declined to submit to a blood alcohol test. The agency's error in not informing her of her right to a representative was harmless because if the appellant had followed the hypothetical advice not to take the test, the likely result would have been an additional charge supporting removal. The Board implied that evidence other than the lab test demonstrated the employee's intoxication on the job. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Manning v. Dept. of Defense</span>, SF-0752-13-0632-I-2 (NP 12/20/2016) (alleged denial of <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right: "The appellant's petition for review challenges the administrative judge's analysis and generally asserts that these errors 'denied [him] the opportunity to elicit favorable facts,' which resulted in 'false charges' being brought against him. However, this generalized assertion does not satisfy his burden to prove by preponderant evidence that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error."); <span class="Italic">Craddock v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 231, 234-35, 6 MSPB 200 (1981) (negotiated agreement authorized the participation of a union representative in performance meetings, but the contract did not require the agency to inform the employee of the right to union representation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At issue in <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 1, 2 (1984), was whether an action based on a charge of insubordination could be overturned because the appellant sought union representation from the union president at a meeting with management, the union president could not attend, and the appellant apparently declined to proceed with another union official present. The Board determined that the appellant's insistence on having the union president present was unreasonable. Appellant's statutory and contractual rights were not violated when he was provided the opportunity to have a different representative. The removal action was sustained based on charges stemming, in part, from the discussion that ensued at the meeting. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weekes v. DHS</span>, 351 Fed. Appx. 442, 444 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (under <span class="Italic">Weingarten,</span> 420 U.S. at 258, the employer does not have to permit a union representative at an interview; that leaves the employee with the choice between having an interview unaccompanied by a representative or having no interview and losing any benefit that he might have gained through an interview).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some interesting discussion was included concerning harmful error in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 681, 685-88 (1985). The employee, a union steward, was discharged when his locker was opened by some individuals who, while seeking a medical claim form, instead found a considerable quantity of undelivered mail. The union contract said that without a reason to suspect crime, the employer could not open a locker without the presence of the employee or a union steward. There was no reason to suspect criminal activity. The contract was plainly violated. What result? <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its position that any error the Board may find should not serve as reason for reversal of the removal action, the agency points to the National Labor Relations Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Taracorp Industries</span>, 273 NLRB No. 54 (Dec. 12, 1984). The agency contends that in that case the NLRB recognized that a make-whole remedy was inappropriate because although the employee's right to union representation was violated (a breach similar to that which occurred here) the employee's misconduct was, nonetheless, proven....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Review of decisions of the courts which led to <span class="Italic">Taracorp</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, indicates that under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), courts have declined to order restoration of an employee who was denied his right under 29 USC 158(a)(1) to union representation where the employee's removal was not based on his request for union assistance or the denial itself.... Because here appellant's removal was based on his misconduct and not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, the agency's action in failing to comply with the contract, we find the decision in <span class="Italic">Taracorp</span> instructive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More directly relevant, however, and the reason for any inconsistency with the NLRB cases, is 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(A), which provides that an agency's action cannot be sustained where the employee shows harmful error in the agency's application of its procedures....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 105 S. Ct. 2882 (1985), supports our conclusion that agency violations of collective bargaining agreements must be harmful to constitute reversible error.... The Court stated that in an appeal of an agency disciplinary decision to the Board, the agency's failure to follow negotiated procedures must affect the result of the agency's decision to take the action, in order for the action to be overturned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree with appellant that sustaining this action allows the agency's violation of the contract to go without redress, we do not believe that the purpose of the contract provision was to shield employees from the consequences of their improper acts or, to the extent the provision may operate in that manner, that this Board should sanction such effect. Moreover, we find no basis for according violations of contractual rights greater importance than is accorded violations of the procedures mandated by Congress....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The denial of an opportunity to secure union representation did not alter the result--sustaining removal--of an agency decision when the appellant did not show how the result would have differed had he been allowed representation, <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 99 MSPR 28, 44 &#x00B6; 35 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that, had he been represented by the union at the investigatory interview, he might have received advice <span id="Page_3150"></span>that would have led him to "clarify his statements to the investigators" and which might, in turn, have caused the agency not to bring all of the charges it brought, or might have caused the agency to impose some penalty short of removal. This speculation as to what the appellant might have done differently had he been represented at the investigatory interview, and how this might have influenced the agency, is unconvincing. The appellant's testimony at the hearing is consistent with what he stated during the interview. More specifically, and as discussed in more detail above, the appellant admitted that he scratched the external serial number off the "extra" server and (to paraphrase) he stated that he did so in the best interests of the agency because he believed that the agency was wasting time and money on unnecessary investigations into a "missing" server that was not really missing. Given the appellant's willingness, when represented by counsel, to testify at the hearing in a manner that is substantially consistent with the statements he provided to AFOSI, any speculation that, had he had a union representative at the time of the interview, he might have said something different then that could have somehow made a difference to the outcome of the case, falls well short of establishing that it likely would have had an impact on the outcome of the case before the agency. We find, therefore, that the AJ correctly concluded that the appellant did not prove his affirmative defense of harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Hammonds v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-10-0399-I-1 (NP 8/31/2011), decided there was no reversible error in the denial of a union representative during questioning of the employee over an incident leading to his removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument on petition for review also appears to reiterate his contention on appeal that the alleged failure to provide a union representative on November 14, 2009, an alleged violation of his rights under <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. 251 (1975), constituted harmful error....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant had the right to union representation if he reasonably believed that the investigation would lead to disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 260-67; <span class="Italic">Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 681, 685-86 (1985). An alleged violation of that right is analyzed under a harmful error standard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Robinson</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. at 686-88. Therefore, the agency's decision may not be sustained if the appellant shows that there was harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at the decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1)]. A harmful error is one that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 47 (2007); <span class="Italic">Stephen v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has not met this burden of proving harmful error. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that his <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights<span class="Italic"></span> were violated when management officials questioned him, he still has not shown that the error was harmful. That is, he has not shown that the alleged error had an outcome-determinative effect on the agency's decision. The agency's evidence was sufficient to support the charge regardless of whether the appellant initially stated he thought the items were trash. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 457, 461 (1988). Further, the appellant merely speculates that he would have benefited from the advice of a union representative to involve the coworker who purportedly gave him permission to take the items. <span class="Italic">See Simmons v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 34 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Gebhardt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 186 F. App'x 996 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In fact, the coworker, a Mail Processing Clerk without supervisory authority, did not support his assertion either in a written statement to the agency prior to its notice of proposed removal or in her hearing testimony. We therefore find no basis for the appellant's assertion of harmful error and no grounds to disturb the administrative judge's decision to sustain the agency's charge of improper conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee has no reasonable fear of discipline, no <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights attach, <span class="Italic">Pew v. VA</span>, SF-0752-13-0060-I-1 (NP 5/23/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>-type rights, which involve a private sector employee's right to request union representation at an investigatory interview that the employee reasonably believes might result in disciplinary action, were granted to federal employees in the Civil Service Reform Act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B); <span class="Italic">Lin v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 129, 130 (1982). The right to union representation is limited to situations where the employee reasonably believes the investigation will result in disciplinary action. The standard of reasonableness is an objective standard which does not inquire into an employee's subjective motivations. <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. 251, 257 n.5. The A/OPC's initial inquiry about the pattern of use of the appellant's credit card was not one where disciplinary action could be reasonably foreseen because she was not accusing the appellant of the misconduct, merely inquiring about whether his credit card had been compromised. Thus, there was no agency denial of <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights and no procedural error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The harmful error doctrine concerning representation was bent in <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The employee was removed for theft of $2.10 of soap from a commissary that employed her. Her collective bargaining contract required that management, when conducting an investigatory or disciplinary interview, advise her of her right to union representation. An interview took place, but no advice of rights was given. On appeal, the employee contended that the failure to advise her of her rights was harmful error. The court found the penalty unreasonable and remanded the case to the Board. Even though the evidence against the employee would not have been diminished had she been represented at a meeting held to discuss the incident with management, the right was still significant; had a representative been present, it was possible that an effective argument could have been advanced in support of mitigation of the otherwise extreme penalty of removal. The court directed the Board to consider, in determining what penalty was appropriate, the error committed by the agency in depriving the employee of the advice that she could have had a union representative. The court's solution was a mixture of harmful error and mitigation doctrines.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In more traditional analysis, <span class="Italic">Butler v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 457, 461 (1988), concluded that no harmful error occurred when an employee first requested a union representative en route to the site of an interview, the employee then arrived at the interview site, and the employee proceeded with the interview without again requesting a representative. The Board added that, assuming the agency committed an error by conducting the interview without a representative, the appellant did not show that the absence of a steward affected the result reached by the agency, i.e., removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shaw v. GPO</span>, 26 MSPR 664, 669 (1985) (employee's reference to union representation was ambiguous; the agency was not faulted for failing to interpret his statement as a request for union representation). An agency did not commit error by denying union representation to an employee at a meeting called to discuss the employee's performance or to inform the employee of a disciplinary action that will be taken. Rights to union representation involve only agency investigations under 5 USC 7114. <span class="Italic">Lim v. USDA</span>, 10 MSPR 129, 130 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The apparent failure of an agency to fully inform an appellant during an investigation that his required testimony could be used against him in a criminal prosecution did not warrant setting aside an adverse action, <span class="Italic">Ayala v. DHS</span>, DA-0752-13-0412-I-2 (NP 9/5/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his position as an Immigration Enforcement Agent based on two specifications of filing a false tax return. On appeal, the appellant alleged, among other things, that the agency failed to provide him with the due process required by <span class="Italic">Kalkines v. United States</span>, 473 F.2d 1391 (Ct. Cl. 1973), because the agency admittedly failed to provide him with the <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> warning before he was interviewed by the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). After holding a hearing, the administrative judge found that the agency proved the charge, the agency did not commit harmful error by failing to provide the <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> warning to the appellant, and the removal penalty was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kalkines</span>, 473 F.2d at 1391, involved an employee who was fired for refusing to answer questions in a civil investigation by his employer because he was concerned that his answers might be used against him in a related criminal action. In <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span>, the court set forth the procedures that a government employer must follow in order to remove an employee for failing to answer questions in a civil disciplinary investigation involving an employee facing a substantial risk of criminal prosecution for actions connected with the subject of the inquiry. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1392-93. Pursuant to <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span>, an agency can remove a federal employee for failing to answer questions in the civil disciplinary inquiry, if the employee is sufficiently warned before questioning "that he is subject to discharge for not answering and that his replies (and their fruits) cannot be employed against him in a criminal case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1393 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no dispute that the agency failed to provide the <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> warning to the appellant. We find, however, that <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> does not apply to the facts of this case because the agency did not remove the appellant for failing to answer questions in the disciplinary investigation. The agency removed the appellant based on his sworn statement admitting that he filed false tax returns in 2007 and 2008, and the appellant does not dispute the facts underlying the charged misconduct on review. Moreover, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that, before the appellant's interview by OPR, the appellant received an "Administrative Warning" that complied with the procedure in <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span>.[3] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The record reflects that the appellant received an "Administrative Warning" advising him, before his OPR interview, that the inquiry was "solely administrative" and that "neither [his] answers, nor any information or evidence gained by reason of [his] answers, [could] be used against [him] in a criminal proceeding," except if such answers were false. <span class="Italic">See Masino v.
