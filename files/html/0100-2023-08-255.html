<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-250"><span class="space">b.</span> Dispute Over Bargaining Unit Status or Arbitrability; Ineffective Elections; Cross-Filing; Withdrawal of Grievance</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Difficulties may occur if it is unclear whether the appellant is in a bargaining unit--as occurred in a RIF case. The employee filed a Board appeal. Evidence was taken on his unit status, and it was determined that he was not a supervisor. Ultimately it was concluded that he was covered by the exclusive provisions of the negotiated agreement, and his Board appeal was dismissed. The result was affirmed, although somewhat reluctantly, on review in <span class="Italic">Baird v. SBA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-1194). <span class="Italic">See Devine v. Levin</span>, 739 F.2d 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (although the court did not direct the Board to accept an otherwise late appeal in an analogous situation, it applauded the government's agreement to avoid opposing an appeal as untimely); <span class="Italic">cf. Brushel, post</span>. In an interesting twist, Mr. Baird's union took his case to arbitration after the Board declined jurisdiction. The arbitrator determined that he had jurisdiction, declared the grievance timely filed, and adjudicated the case on the merits. The agency filed exceptions with the Federal Labor Relations Authority, contending that the employee exercised his statutory election by first taking his case to the Board. FLRA dismissed the exception: because the contract covered reductions in force, the Board was precluded from exercising any jurisdiction without an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice. If the Board could not obtain jurisdiction as a matter of law, the "election" was ineffective; an arbitrator was not precluded from considering the grievance challenging the RIF under the negotiated procedure. <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 2532</span>, 32 FLRA 311 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit suggested in <span class="Italic">Hess v. IRS,</span> 892 F.2d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 1989), that unit status at the time of a personnel action that is grieved determines arbitrability--even if the underlying events occurred when the grievant was not in the unit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gilbert Hess, as a tax auditor with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), was in a bargaining unit represented by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) and covered by the IRS collective bargaining agreement. Hess was promoted from the bargaining unit to a supervisory position and remained there until he was demoted to tax auditor for failing probation as a manager. After returning to the bargaining unit, the IRS dismissed Hess for conduct not related to the ground for demotion that occurred while he was a supervisor. Hess elected to grieve his removal through arbitration pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) (1988). The IRS opposed Hess' right to arbitrate because his removal was based on alleged misconduct that occurred while he was a supervisor. The case was submitted to the arbitrator on stipulated facts for a determination of the arbitrability of Hess' grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_411"></span>ISSUE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether a bargaining unit member may elect to grieve an adverse action that is based on conduct occurring while outside the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPINION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act provides an "aggrieved employee" with a statutory right of election to file a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, rather than an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). Title 5 excludes "a supervisor or a management official" from the definition of employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(B)(iii) (1988). Thus, the dispositive issue is whether arbitrability is based on status, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> bargaining unit member or supervisor, at the time of the adverse action or status at the time the underlying conduct occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the employee's status at the time the adverse action is taken--not the status at the time of the underlying conduct--determines arbitrability.[*] An employee becomes "aggrieved" due to an agency's adverse action and not because of any action on the employee's part. The time for determining whether he is an "aggrieved" employee is necessarily at the time the adverse action was taken because, prior to that time, he has nothing to appeal and cannot be aggrieved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of the adverse action, Hess was an employee within the bargaining unit. He was removed from a bargaining unit position, not a supervisory position. Accordingly, we vacate the arbitrator's award and remand for arbitration to proceed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Devine v. Levin,</span> 739 F.2d 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the arbitrability issue resolved was whether the employee fell within the statutory definition of "supervisor." There was no issue raised as to the dispositive time for determining the employee's status, nor any indication of the employee's status at the time of the adverse action. Consequently, the Levin court did not decide the issue presented in this case. Therefore, no conflict in the holdings of this court in Levin and in the present case should be inferred from the language of the opinion in either.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[FLRA entertains unit clarification petitions to determine the unit status of individual employees; refer to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Human Resources Service Center and AFGE</span>, 61 FLRA 408, 410-11 (2005); refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-261.html#sec1-256">Failure to Obtain Arbitration Hearing</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined in <span class="Italic">Brushel v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3155), that an ineffective attempt at a grievance by a nonunit employee does not necessarily divest the Board of jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the initiation of the grievance procedures by Mr. Brushel did not waive his right to appeal to the Board. It is undisputed that supervisory employees are not covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and thus the agency action returning Mr. Brushel to a nonsupervisory position was nongrievable. Accordingly, the attempt by Mr. Brushel to initiate grievance procedures is not encompassed by the terms of 5 USC 7121(e)(1), which are limited to matters that "fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure...." Accordingly, he did not waive his right to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Simultaneous cross-filing may be an approach if an incorrect choice of a forum is so serious a problem. There are no definitive pronouncements on the cross-filing technique before the Board--although it is a procedure used with some frequency by lawyers who are unsure (because of jurisdictional ambiguities) of the proper court for a particular action. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 602, 604 (1988), implied that an appellant could enter into a settlement agreement withdrawing a Board appeal "without prejudice," with the possibility of reinstating the Board appeal if his grievance was barred from arbitration. The Board's opinion was not particularly informative on the jurisdictional issue. In <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. SSA</span>, 15 MSPR 217, 218 n.1 (1983), the appellant challenged his dismissal by simultaneously filing a Board appeal and a grievance. The AJ dismissed the appeal without prejudice so that the arbitrator could determine if the removal was grievable under the negotiated agreement. More than a year later, the arbitrator determined that it was not; the appellant refiled the Board appeal. The Board adjudicated the case without comment on this procedure other than a description of the events. Perhaps <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span> suggests that an individual may cross-file and delay Board adjudication until it is clear whether the case is going to arbitration. This would be a positive step: cross-filing would protect the right to hearing and adjudication through grievance and appellate procedures established by the Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even cross-filing may not be a solution. The Board will not indefinitely extend the period for filing a Board appeal while the appellant seeks to obtain an arbitrability determination concerning a grievance over an action that he hopes to pursue to MSPB if the action is not covered by the contract. <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 541, 543, 4 MSPB 60 (1980) ("This Board is not obligated, as appellant requested, to extend indefinitely the time for filing a petition for appeal pending the disposition of matters which affect neither the jurisdiction of the Board to hear the case nor the merits of the case. An indeterminate delay of the proceeding, without a demonstration of good cause, is not consonant with the congressional mandate for the expeditious processing of appeals with due regard to the rights of all parties.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interesting problems concerning cross-filing arose in <span class="Italic">Duncan v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 72, 75 (1985). The appellant was removed and then filed a Board appeal. He later notified the Board by letter that he elected to proceed under a grievance procedure. A month later, the AJ dismissed the appeal. When the appellant pursued the grievance through arbitration, the decision was that the grievance was not arbitrable because the employee had appealed to the Board. The appellant then moved to reopen his appeal with the Board, a motion denied by the AJ. On review, citing <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 233, 236 (1985), the Board first noted in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> that because the employee worked for the Postal Service, he was not required to elect between arbitration and the statutory appeal process. The question was not whether the Board was precluded from exercising jurisdiction, but whether a basis was established either for rescission of an appellant-initiated dismissal of an appeal or for the filing of a late appeal, both to be evaluated under the same criteria:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant withdrew his appeal with the clear intention of proceeding under the negotiated grievance procedure. Appellant invoked arbitration and a full hearing was held. Appellant now asserts that the adverse arbitration decision was due to erroneous advice from his representative regarding the timing of his withdrawal of his appeal filed with the Board. However, in view of the fact that the arbitrator cited previous decisions regarding the effect of a Board appeal on the arbitrability of a grievance, appellant and his representative should have been on notice regarding the consequences of the respective appeals. Moreover, appellant does not assert or establish that the presiding official erred in dismissing his first appeal pursuant to his request, or that the agency or the Board contributed to appellant's representative's error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Essentially the same result occurred in <span class="Italic">Lewis v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 228, 232-33 (1991). What should Mr. Duncan have done to protect his rights? The reviewing court, sustaining the Board, offered no concrete advice, <span class="Italic">Duncan v. MSPB</span>, 795 F.2d 1000, 1001-03 &#x0026; n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is the somewhat unhappy tale of a federal employee apparently whipsawed between the Merit Systems Protection Board...and the arbitrator, both deciding that they would not hear petitioner Duncan's case on the merits since he had also sought relief from the other tribunal.... Because the MSPB was not responsible for placing petitioner in this predicament, we affirm its decision with the hope that in the future better steps will be taken by employing agencies and unions to counsel employees against taking the unfortunate course Duncan pursued here because of mistaken advice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner urges as "good cause" that he was unlettered in the law, wished to assure that he would receive a hearing on the merits of his defense to the agency charges, and followed the route he was advised to take. He says that (i) he was told that, to have an arbitration hearing, his union would have to certify his case for that proceeding; (ii) to assure a hearing, in the event he was not certified, he filed his appeal with the MSPB; (iii) he did not know that, if he filed that appeal but later withdrew it in order to proceed (after certification) with arbitration, he would be barred from arbitration; and (iv) after union certification, he was advised by his non-lawyer representative to withdraw his appeal from the MSPB--which he did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are twin difficulties with this position. The first is that petitioner was expressly told by his agency's removal letter that if he appealed to the MSPB he would thereby waive access to the grievance-arbitration procedures. This very specific notice charged him with making inquiry whether he could nevertheless appeal safely to the Board and then withdraw that appeal, without jeopardizing his arbitration rights. However, he merely assumed that he could withdraw without such potential harm. Apparently, his non-lawyer representative concurred or may even have suggested that course. But it is settled that federal personnel are bound by the actions of their freely selected representatives or agents.... Perhaps, if petitioner had asked a lawyer (or someone familiar with labor arbitration, such as the personnel office of his agency), he would have been warned--because of the then existence of prior arbitral decisions on the point--of the peril of appealing to the MSPB. In any event, <span class="Italic">Massingale v. MSPB</span>, [736 F.2d 1521 (Fed. Cir. 1984)], in which a federal employee relied (before he appealed to the MSPB) on his union's advice that arbitration could be had, only to find out from the arbitrator that the particular matter was not arbitrable, is very comparable to this case. There, we refused to reject the Board's determination that there was no "good cause" for the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though the MSPB cannot be faulted and we consider the result we reach to be correct, that resolution is a nagging one. Duncan has not had and will not have any hearing on the merits of his case. If the rule is to continue that arbitral proceedings will be aborted even by a protective appeal withdrawn from the MSPB prior to any significant activity in that tribunal,[2] we think that the employing agencies and the unions should advise employees, more precisely, of the dangers of appealing to the MSPB, even the taking of a protective appeal to preserve their rights to <span id="Page_412"></span>a hearing if the union should fail or refuse to certify them for arbitration under collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We do not have before us for review the arbitrator's decision in this case, but we have some doubt whether it is necessary to refuse arbitration in this situation of a protective appeal to the MSPB before union certification has been obtained--a protective appeal which is withdrawn immediately after certification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duncan</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Villante v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 542, 545 (1987), when employees apparently grieved their RIFs and their contract was subsequently amended to exclude RIFs as grievable disputes. The Board, unconcerned with that turn of events, announced both that jurisdiction would be measured at the time the agency took the challenged action and that delayed Board appeals would not lie. The Board offered that "agencies and unions should properly advise employees of the possibly adverse legal consequences of voluntarily electing to pursue the negotiated grievance procedure under their collective bargaining agreements before filing delayed appeals with the Board. Their failure to do so may, as here, deprive employees of administrative avenues of redress." <span class="Italic">See Janini v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 106 MSPR 111, 2007 MSPB 150 (2007) (declining to reopen the case or allow a late appeal when the appellant filed a timely Board appeal, withdrew the appeal to pursue arbitration, and then apparently found that the arbitrator would not adjudicate the case on the merits because of the earlier-filed Board appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A "protective appeal," alluded to in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, was unavailing in <span class="Italic">Allison v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3269):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allison had been employed by the Postal Service since September 1980. Prior to his Postal Service employment, Mr. Allison served in the U.S. Army, making him a veteran's preference eligible employee. When Mr. Allison was removed from his position at the Postal Service on October 14, 1997, he challenged his removal through proper grievance procedures with the help of his Union. As a preference eligible employee, Mr. Allison, on November 12, 1997, also filed an appeal to the MSPB. MSPB procedures require an appeal to be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date of the action being appealed, and Mr. Allison, by his filing, sought to preserve his MSPB appeal rights in the event that the Union chose not to invoke arbitration on his grievance. In due course, Mr. Allison's grievance was denied by the Postal Service, and, with full knowledge of the pending MSPB appeal, the Union subsequently appealed this grievance denial to arbitration on January 15, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon learning of the Union's decision to appeal his grievance to arbitration, Mr. Allison sought to withdraw his MSPB appeal and pursue the arbitration. He requested a withdrawal without prejudice so that his appeal could be reinstated at a later date if he was denied grievance-arbitration. The MSPB administrative judge ("AJ") informed Mr. Allison's representative that dismissal could not be without prejudice unless the parties stipulated to such a dismissal or compelling reasons existed for such a dismissal. The AJ noted that the Postal Service's representative would not stipulate to a dismissal without prejudice and ruled that there was no compelling reason for a dismissal without prejudice. Therefore, the AJ informed Mr. Allison's representative that the dismissal would be with prejudice. In addition, the AJ specifically informed Mr. Allison's representative that the Postal Service would not allow the case to go to arbitration if the Board appeal was pending. Mr. Allison's representative stated that Mr. Allison still wished to withdraw and submitted a motion in support of a dismissal without prejudice in an attempt to protect Mr. Allison from the possibility that the Postal Service might improperly obstruct his use of grievance-arbitration. That motion was denied, and the appeal was dismissed with prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the pendency of this matter before the MSPB, the AJ informed Mr. Allison's representative that the AJ lacked control over the arbitration proceeding, but encouraged the Postal Service representative "to use his good offices to facilitate a continuation of the arbitration proceeding, since that was [Mr. Allison's] desire. Unfortunately for Mr. Allison, his grievance-arbitration was subsequently found nonarbitrable on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding Veteran's Preference under Section 16.9 of the National Agreement between the Postal Service and the National Postal Mail Handlers Union, AFL-CIO ("National Agreement"), pursuant to which the Union is deemed to have waived access to arbitration if "at the time that the Union appeals the grievance to arbitration, the grievant also has an appeal pending before the MSPB." Mr. Allison subsequently petitioned the full Board to review the AJ's dismissal with prejudice. Mr. Allison appeals the Board's denial of his petition to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that absent unusual circumstances, such as misinformation or new and material evidence, it will not reopen or reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn, merely because the appellant wishes to proceed before the Board<span class="Italic">. See ZuhIke v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 74 MSPR 401, 404 (1997). The Board found that Mr. Allison had been property informed of the consequences of his choices throughout his appeal and grievance-arbitration process. in addition, Mr. Allison has alleged no new and material evidence. Thus, we do not find that the Board abused its discretion in denying Mr. Allison's petition as a request to reopen or reinstate his original appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite our affirmance of the Board's decision, this court notes that the effect of the Memorandum of Understanding Veteran's Preference does not comport well with the intent of Section 16.9 of the National Agreement to confer a special status on the job tenure of a preference eligible employee. Mr. Allison's situation is illustrative of this problem. Mr. Allison timely filed his MSPB appeal to preserve his MSPB appeal rights in the event that the Union chose not to invoke arbitration on his removal. When Mr. Allison learned that the Union had invoked arbitration, he sought to withdraw from his MSPB appeal without prejudice. The Postal Service would not stipulate to Mr. Allison's withdrawal without prejudice and subsequently held that, under the collective bargaining agreement, Mr. Allison had waived his right to grieve his removal to arbitration. This method by which the Postal Service effectively denied third-party review of removal has been addressed by the MSPB and this court in the past<span class="Italic">. See Zuhlke</span>, 74 MSPR at 403-05; <span class="Italic">Lewis v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 47 MSPR 228, 231-32 (1991); <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 29 MSPR at 73-75; <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 795 F.2d at 1002-03.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reiterate this court's lament, voiced years ago in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, that although the MSPB cannot be faulted, the result of this case is unfortunate, <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 795 F.2d at 1003. Mr. Allison, like Mr. Duncan, has been denied the opportunity for a hearing on the merits of his case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the rule is to continue that arbitration proceedings will be aborted even by a protective appeal withdrawn from the MSPB before consideration on its merits, the employing agencies and the unions must improve communication with the employees they represent and more precisely advise employees of the dangers of appealing to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, in agreement with the <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> court, we have some doubt whether it is necessary to refuse arbitration in circumstances like this case, where a protective appeal was filed at the MSPB before union certification and was immediately withdrawn after certification and before consideration on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Smith v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3133) (noting that if the appellant is concerned about losing her right to file suit in district court, she could timely file a protective appeal with the MSPB and request a stay of one of the proceedings).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7121(e) works a harsh result for some employees who file grievances and, for many reasons not of their creation, cannot obtain an arbitration hearing. The Board could create a simultaneous filing system that would avoid an ineffective statutory election. Better yet, the statute should be amended to permit deferral of a Board appeal for individuals who attempt to pursue their cases through grievance procedures, just as deferred Board appeals may be secured by individuals who pursue EEO complaints challenging actions within the Board's jurisdiction. [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-038.html#sec2-37">Irregular and Misdirected Filings</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some slight relief arrived for confused postal employees in <span class="Italic">Zuhlke v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 401, 404-05 (1997). Although the Board did not create a simultaneous filing procedure, it at least determined that it would reinstate an appeal once timely filed but withdrawn by a postal employee who was not on notice that withdrawal of the appeal would block later access to the Board if pursuit of the grievance proved futile:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 795 F.2d 1000, the court affirmed the Board's denial of Duncan's request to reinstate his withdrawn appeal. As in the instant appeal, Duncan had argued that the withdrawal of his appeal was based on his mistaken belief that he could pursue the grievance-arbitration procedure after such withdrawal. The court noted that Duncan had been "expressly told by his agency's removal letter that if he appealed to the MSPB [Merit Systems Protection Board] he would thereby waive access to the grievance-arbitration procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1002. The court then stated that "[t]his very specific notice charged him with making inquiry whether he could nevertheless appeal safely to the Board and then withdraw that appeal, without jeopardizing his arbitration rights." <span class="Italic">Id. Accord Lewis</span>, 47 MSPR at 232 &#x0026; n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this holding, the court stated in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> that the result reached was a "nagging one" because Duncan "has not had and will not have any hearing on the merits of his case." 795 F.2d at 1003. The court recommended that "the employing agencies and the unions...advise employees, more precisely, of the dangers of appealing to the MSPB," in terms of how it affects their right to pursue the grievance-arbitration procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, unlike in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> and <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, the agency's decision notice did not notify the appellant that, by filing a Board appeal, he would waive his grievance-arbitration rights. The decision notice only informed him of his Board appeal rights, and did not mention his grievance rights at all. Hence, unlike in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> and <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, the appellant's mistaken belief that he could pursue the grievance-arbitration procedure after withdrawing his Board appeal was excusable since the lack of adequate notice by the agency likely contributed to such a mistaken belief. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lewis</span>, 47 MSPR at 232 (the Board refused to reinstate a withdrawn appeal where there was no showing that "the agency...contributed to [the appellant's] ...decision to proceed to arbitration"). Moreover, any prejudice to the agency resulting <span id="Page_413"></span>from the appellant's delayed pursuit of this appeal would be due to the agency's own failure to adequately notify him regarding his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant's request for reinstatement of his appeal should be granted. <span class="Italic">Cf. Peartree v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 332, 342 (1995) (the EEOC found, based on the employing agency's failure to provide adequate notice of appeal rights, that the appellant's Board appeal did not constitute a valid election of appeal rights, and the Board deferred to this EEOC finding in accepting a second Board appeal after a prior Board appeal was dismissed as untimely filed); <span class="Italic">Dawson v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 194, 196 (1990) (the Board deferred to a similar EEOC finding in accepting a second Board appeal after a prior Board appeal was dismissed as withdrawn).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Landingham v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 77, 82 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (Board deferred to EEOC determinations that appellants do not make valid elections between Board appellate and EEO procedures when agency decision letters inform employees of the right to appeal to the Board but do not advise them of the right to file an EEO complaint with the agency and of the consequences of that election).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A timely grievance binds the appellant, who cannot later withdraw the grievance to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Webster v. VA</span>, CH-0752-14-0268-I-1 (NP 9/5/2014) ("The appellant also argues that, although a grievance was filed to appeal the removal decision, he withdrew the grievance in a timely manner before an adjudicator was assigned.
