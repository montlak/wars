<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-296"><span class="space">8.</span> Military Restoration Rights</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Restoration rights for employees serving in certain types of military duty were summarized, <span class="Italic">Andrews v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 233, 237-39 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a) (1989), an employee of an Executive agency who is covered by 5 C.F.R. part 353 may appeal to the Board an agency's failure to restore him or his improper restoration. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301, when an employee is entitled to restoration under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021, &#x00A7; 2024(a), &#x00A7; 2024(b), or &#x00A7; 2024(c), the agency is required to follow the requirements of subpart 353C. Therefore, an employee entitled to restoration under the statutory provisions listed above could appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2021(a) addresses the restoration of those individuals who have been inducted into the armed service under the Military Selective Services Act. Section 2024(a) addresses the restoration of those individuals who enlist in the Armed Services (other than in a Reserve component). Section <span id="Page_506"></span>2024(b) covers those individuals who, after entering employment on the basis of which restoration or reemployment is claimed, enter active duty (other than for the purpose of determining physical fitness and other than for training). Finally, section 2024(c) covers a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces who is ordered to an initial period of active duty for training. Given the undisputed facts of this case, the appellant does not appear to meet the definition of an individual entitled to restoration under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a), &#x00A7; 2024(a), &#x00A7; 2024(b), or &#x00A7; 2024(c)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sections 2021(b)(1) and 2021(b)(2) govern the entitlement of any person who has been restored or reemployed in a position in accordance with the provisions of clause (A) or clause (B) of section 2021(a). Section 2021(b)(3) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any person who seeks or holds a position described in clause (A) or (B) of subsection (a) of this section shall not be denied hiring, retention in employment, or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a Reserve component of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The positions described in clause (A) are those "in the employ of the United States Government...." Because the appellant works for the United States Air Force, he qualifies for rights under section 2021(b)(3). As the agency stated, the question is whether the appellant can bring this claim before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The implementing regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, pursuant to its authority under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2023, state that an individual with rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353 may appeal to the Board. Section 353.301 of those regulations covers individuals with rights under section 2021 of the statute. This regulatory section does not distinguish between rights under section 2021(a) and those under section 2021(b). Thus, we find that the appellant was entitled to appeal his alleged improper restoration following the completion of his military duty on May 27, 1989. <span class="Italic">Cf. Perez v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 149, 149-50 (1980) (veteran seeking to return to the civil service may appeal to the Board if he has a right to restoration under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021, &#x00A7; 2024(a), &#x00A7; 2024(b), or &#x00A7; 2024(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Antolin</span> to support its contention that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's case is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Antolin,</span> the court was examining the discharge of an employee serving in a temporary position. Although the employee was discharged on the ground that he was unable to cooperate with his supervisor, he asserted that he was being dismissed due to his membership in the Army Reserve. He therefore urged the court to consider 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(b)(3) as a basis of jurisdiction. The court assumed <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant had established his claim that his discharge was due to his membership in the Army Reserve and that he occupied a position other than a temporary one, but it held that the existence of such a claim did not mean that jurisdiction to hear the claim lay with the Board. The court noted the absence of "evidence that Antolin was inducted into the armed forces, was discharged, and subsequently applied for reemployment," and it found that jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's claim was not vested in the Board "since no law, rule or regulation provides that such 'retention' cases under &#x00A7; 2021(b)(3) be heard" by the Board. <span class="Italic">Antolin,</span> 895 F.2d at 1397.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case differs significantly from <span class="Italic">Antolin.</span> In <span class="Italic">Antolin,</span> the court was refusing to recharacterize a case of dismissal, which did not involve the employee's right to restoration after military duty, as a case involving restoration rights. <span class="Italic">See Antolin,</span> 895 F.2d at 1397 n.3 (court's reference to its "conclu[sion] that Antolin has not pled, and apparently is not able to plead, an employment restoration case"). In this case, unlike <span class="Italic">Antolin,</span> the appellant is challenging the propriety of his restoration after military service. As we have indicated above, the Board has jurisdiction over restoration appeals by virtue of 5 C.F.R. part 353. Therefore, the holding in <span class="Italic">Antolin</span> is not applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find further that the administrative judge erred in his analysis when he examined the propriety of the appellant's entitlement to a promotion as a question of jurisdiction. He should have first found that the appellant triggered the Board's jurisdiction by alleging that he had been improperly restored following the completion of his military service on May 30, 1989, and he should then have proceeded to determine whether the appellant was entitled to the promotion under the factual circumstances presented.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reserve duty may carry restoration rights, and notice of appeal rights from the agency, <span class="Italic">Baker v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 688-91 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a Reservist in the U.S. Army who was called up to attend other than an initial period of military training, claims protection under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d), which provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee not covered by subsection (c) of this section [which governs the rights of Reservists attending an initial period of training] who holds a position described in clause (A)...of section [4301] (a) [which relates to federal employees] shall upon request be granted a leave of absence by such person's employer for the period required to perform active duty for training or inactive duty training in the Armed Forces of the United States. Upon such employee's release from a period of such active duty for training or inactive duty training...such employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's position with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation as such employee would have had if such employee had not been absent for such purposes.... If an employee covered by this subsection is not qualified to perform the duties of such employee's position by reason of a disability sustained during active duty for training or inactive duty training, but is qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the employ of the employer...such employee shall be offered employment and, if such person so requests, be employed by that employer...in such other position the duties of which such employee is qualified to perform as will provide the employee like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof consistent with the circumstances in such employee's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service is subject to section 4304(d) <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(a). Further, the appellant's claim that the agency violated his rights under section 4304(d) is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Albrecht v. Department of the Army,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 304, 307 (1994); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102, 353.401(a). There is no dispute that the agency permitted the appellant to return to his Mailhandler position following his military training, as it was required to do. The administrative judge did not address the appellant's claim that the agency violated his statutory rights by not offering him employment in another position, the duties of which he could perform. Instead, she held that he had no right to appeal the agency's failure to offer him employment in another position because he did not show that he "applied for restoration...pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d)..."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the administrative judge meant to hold that an appeal alleging a violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d) is not ripe for adjudication if the agency did not know or have reason to know that the employee had sustained a debilitating injury during military training, and thus cannot be considered to have made a decision, or even taken a position, on the employee's rights under section 4304(d), we agree. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (the Board shall not issue advisory opinions). In the present appeal, however, the agency was on sufficient notice of the appellant's potential rights under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d), despite his apparent failure to make a formal application for assignment to another position expressly designated as a request for employment under the statute. In this connection, we note that section 4304(d) does not require such a formal application expressly citing the statute, and we will not infer that Congress intended such a requirement. <span class="Italic">Cf. King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,</span> 502 U.S. 215, 221 n.9 (1991) (a statute such as 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d) (codified at the time of the court's decision at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024(d)), is intended for the benefit of those who serve in the armed forces, and should be liberally interpreted in their favor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency was aware during the appellant's absence that he was unable to perform his Mailhandler duties. It also knew, based on his requests for a light-duty assignment, that he wished to return to work. The agency also knew, at the time of the appellant's resignation, if not earlier, that, according to the appellant, he was unable to perform his Mailhandler duties because of an injury that he sustained during military training. (the PS-50 recording the appellant's separation states: "Employee resigned due to permanent condition arising from injuries incurred while in active duty military status"); (forms approving the appellant's absence, signed by his supervisor on June 19, 1990 and June 25, 1990, expressly indicate that the appellant was suffering from an injury that was not job related, suggesting that the agency knew when he was injured).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant's claim that the agency violated his rights under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d), by not employing him in a position the duties of which he could perform, is ripe for adjudication. Accordingly, the portion of the initial decision that dismissed that claim is VACATED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that there is no basis for concluding that the appellant abandoned his rights under section 4304(d). We note that the administrative judge found in the adverse action appeal that the appellant declined an offer of an evening light-duty assignment that the agency made in response to his August 16, 1990 request. However, since this offer was for evening light duty, it was not within the medical restrictions that the appellant claimed he was under at the time, namely, he was able to work mornings only. Moreover, the administrative judge's finding was not based on evidence presented at a return rights appeal, but rather at the hearing in the adverse action appeal, a hearing that did not encompass, and that the administrative judge expressly stated was not intended to encompass, the claim presented in the return rights appeal. The appellant, therefore, had no reason to know at the time of the hearing that he would be required to prove his return rights claim, or that he would be required to rebut, for purposes of that claim, evidence presented in opposition to claims of constructive suspension, involuntary <span id="Page_507"></span>resignation, and disability discrimination that differ from the return rights claim. Under the circumstances, then--that is, at this stage and on this record--there is no basis to conclude that the appellant abandoned his rights under section 4304(d) by not accepting the agency's offer of a light-duty assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's claim for violation of his return rights is within the Board's jurisdiction, he is entitled to the hearing that he requested, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), if there is good cause for the untimely filing of the petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has demonstrated good cause for the untimely filing of the return rights appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed his petition for appeal over two years after the agency's alleged violation of his rights under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(d) well beyond the deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 1201.22(b). An agency must advise an employee of his or her right to file a Board appeal when it does not honor rights asserted under section 4304(d). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. As noted above, the agency knew or should have known that the appellant had a claim under section 4304(d) when he resigned, if not earlier. An agency's failure to provide notice of appeal rights when it takes an appealable action may justify a waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 669, 670-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 603, 609 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant averred in his affidavit, filed below, that the agency never advised him of any right to appeal its action or inaction to the Board. This averment is unrebutted, and is supported by the record. The appellant further averred that if the agency had advised him of his appeal rights, he would have filed a Board appeal immediately. We note, in this connection, that the appellant filed his appeal promptly upon being advised by OPM that the proper place to appeal an alleged violation of return rights is the Board. Under the circumstances, we find good cause for the untimely filing of the petition for appeal. The agency "effectively contributed to [the appellant's] failure to file a timely appeal, or, perhaps, even caused such untimely filing altogether."<span class="Italic">Shiflett,</span> 839 F.2d at 673.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An individual may request restoration rights prior to release from military duty, but that individual is not guaranteed that restoration will be at the same location that he left to enter the military, <span class="Italic">Waidzunas v. VA</span>, 56 MSPR 529, 531-35 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as a Podiatrist (VP 0668, intermediate grade, step 3) at the agency's Medical Center in Battle Creek, Michigan, when he resigned on June 26, 1986, to enter active duty with the U.S. Army. By letter dated January 17, 1989, the appellant contacted the agency concerning restoration to his former position. On May 15, 1989, prior to the appellant's release from active duty on June 29, 1989, the agency denied his application for restoration because there were no available Podiatrist positions at the Battle Creek facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge reversed the agency's action, finding that the appellant was entitled to mandatory restoration to his former position at the Center under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301. The administrative judge further found that the earliest date the appellant was entitled to restoration, after his June 29, 1989 release from active military service, was July 25, 1989, and ordered the agency to retroactively restore the appellant to his position of Podiatrist with the VA Medical Center, Battle Creek, Michigan, effective July 25, 1989.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review of the initial decision, the appellant contends, in pertinent part, that the agency should have restored him on June 30, 1989, the date upon which he was available after his release from active duty on June 29, 1989. The appellant further contends that he is entitled to restoration to his prior position of Chief of Podiatry and Director of Podiatric Residency, with pay and benefits, including seniority. The agency has not filed a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Position to which the appellant is entitled upon restoration</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a)(A)(i), the employer must restore the veteran, if still qualified to perform the duties of such position or able to become qualified with reasonable efforts by the employer, "to his former job or to a position of like seniority, status and pay...." The appellant contends that he was not ordered restored to his position of Chief of Podiatry and Director of Podiatry Service, and that restoration to a position of Podiatrist at the Medical Center fails to comport with his seniority right and is contrary to the "escalator principle."[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Under this principle, a returning veteran steps back on the seniority escalator at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept his position with the employer continuously during the period of military service. <span class="Italic">See Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp.,</span> 100 S. Ct. 2100 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the record here shows only that the appellant resigned from the position of Podiatrist (VP 0668, intermediate grade, step 3), and that the administrative judge's restoration order was limited to the appellant's position of Podiatrist. Since the appellant is entitled under the statute to restoration to his former position, or to a position of like seniority, status and pay, we have modified the restoration order below to be fully consistent with 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a)(A)(i).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency, in the first instance, must determine what specific position to offer the appellant so that he is either restored to his original position with its attendant status, or to another position that is not inferior to his former position and with like seniority and pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Date of restoration</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a), an employee who is returning from military duty must make an application for reemployment within 90 days after release from such service. It is well settled that reemployment statutes are to be liberally construed for the benefit of those who left their employment to enter the Armed Forces. <span class="Italic">See Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp.,</span> 100 S. Ct. 2100, 2104 (1980); <span class="Italic">Dyer v. Hinky Dinky, Inc.,</span> 710 F.2d 1348, 1350 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Paniagua v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 306, 309 (1982), citing <span class="Italic">Tilton v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co.,</span> 84 S. Ct. 595, 602 (1964).[3] Thus, the Office of Personnel Management's implementing regulation provides that the individual "must be restored <span class="Italic">as soon as possible</span> after making application but <span class="Italic">in no event later than 30 days</span> after the application is received by the agency."<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Malko v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 42, 46(1980) (the Federal statutes providing for the protection of discharged veterans on return to civilian status are to be given liberal construction for the benefit of the veteran, as long as violence is not done to the exact language of the statute). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(b)(l) (a person who is restored shall be considered as having been on furlough or leave of absence, shall be restored without loss of seniority, shall participate in insurance or other benefits programs, and shall be protected from discharge without cause for one year after reemployment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge remarked in his initial decision that both the statute and the regulation are premised upon the assumption that requests for restoration will be made after discharge from the service. We note, however, that neither provision prohibits pre-discharge requests for restoration; the statute mentions the date of actual separation from military service or training only as a reckoning point for calculation of the veteran's 90-day period of eligibility for restoration after separation. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a). There is no requirement that the application for restoration must be made after release from military duty. To the contrary, it has been held in related cases that a returning veteran's application made prior to his discharge from the military service constitutes a continuing, and thus sufficient, application for reemployment. <span class="Italic">See Martin v. Roosevelt Hospital</span>, 426 F.2d 155, 159 (2d Cir. 1970) (while still in the service, the employee made two requests for restoration, putting the hospital on ample notice of his claim to reinstatement in his prior position). <span class="Italic">See also Van Doren v. Van Doren Laundry Service, Inc.</span>, 162 F.2d 1007, 1009 (3d Cir. 1947) (since the application was of a continuing nature, the statutory requirement that it be made within 90 days after the employee was "relieved from such training and service" was met based on the pre-release initiation of the application).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The protective and remedial nature of the statute, as well as the plain language of the implementing regulation, suggest further that the applicant for restoration be reemployed as soon after discharge as he is ready, willing, and able to go to work. In <span class="Italic">Carr v. RCA Rubber Company</span>, 609 F. Supp. 526, 529 (N.D. Ohio 1985), the court interpreted 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a) to require that, not only does the employee's pre-discharge request for restoration constitute a proper application, but also the employee must be reinstated on the date after his honorable discharge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, because the appellant was discharged more than 30 days after making his demand for restoration, the agency could not have complied with the 30-day deadline set by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a). The agency submitted no evidence, however, why the appellant could not have been restored prior to July 25, 1989. The appellant, on the other hand, claimed without contradiction, that he was available for work the day after his discharge, i.e., June 30, 1989. We find, therefore, that the appellant was entitled to be restored on June 30, 1989.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Restoration at other facilities</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant states in his petition for review that, prior to the issuance of the initial decision, the agency advised him of a vacant position in Augusta, Georgia, for which he would be qualified and have seniority to assume. He further states that, since the issuance of the initial decision, the agency has retaliated against him by failing to provide information about the position in Augusta, Georgia, and by directing him to return to a "staff position in Battle Creek, Michigan."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot discern how the appellant's retaliation argument has any direct bearing on this appeal. Prior to the issuance of this Opinion and Order, the Board has not issued a final remedial order with which the agency must comply. Further, to the extent that the appellant may be arguing that he should be restored to a podiatrist position at another facility, we <span id="Page_508"></span>note that the basic right to restoration is at the facility he left, i.e., the agency's Medical Center in Battle Creek, Michigan. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 77, 82 (1984); <span class="Italic">Britton v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 170 (1984). The appellant does not have the unilateral right to be restored at a specific facility other than the facility at which he was last employed. <span class="Italic">See Moore</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 82<span class="Italic">.</span> Thus, restoration at the Medical Center, Battle Creek, Michigan, is proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moore v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 77, 81-83 (1987), cited in <span class="Italic">Waidzunas</span>, distinguished military return rights and restoration rights for individuals absent from employment because of compensable injury:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-2026, and the regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that implement the statutes regarding federal employees, 5 C.F.R. Part 353, subpart C, provide the right to restoration to individuals who were employed by any agency of the executive branch, including the Postal Service. An individual who seeks restoration, upon satisfactory completion of military service and timely application, shall "if still qualified to perform the duties of such position, be restored to such position or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay..." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2021(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has provided official guidance to agencies concerning their obligation to restore a former employee. OPM advises agencies that the responsibility for restoring an employee rests on the agency, not just the installation the employee left because of military service, and that an "employee must be restored if there is an appropriate position anywhere in the agency." Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Ch. 353, subch. 4-2(b) (Mar. 6, 1978). OPM's official guidance also provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Although employees' restoration rights are agencywide, the basic right is for restoration at the installation they left because of injury or military duty. Employees and their agency may agree, however, that they be restored at another installation.</span> Also, if employees cannot be restored to their former positions and if there are no comparable positions at the installation they left, they may elect to take a position of like seniority, status, and pay at another installation instead of the next best available position at the installation they left.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Ch. 353, Appendix B-3 (Oct. 29, 1975) (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has construed this FPM provision as requiring that, unless the parties agree otherwise, the agency must restore a qualifying employee returning from military duty at the facility that last employed him in his former position or, if that position is not available, to a position of like seniority, status, and pay, or if such equivalent position is not available, then to the next best available position for which he is qualified. <span class="Italic">See Britton v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 170, 172 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contended below that he has a right of <span class="Italic">restoration</span> to the agency facility of his choice in Anchorage. The Board has held that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), an agency is obligated to give <span class="Italic">priority consideration</span> for reemployment to a qualifying former employee at the facility that last employed him, rather than another facility, "and if that if not feasible, at any other agency facility having an equivalent position available." <span class="Italic">Withers v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 379, 383 (1985). <span class="Italic">See Whitfield v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 239, 242 (1981). A former employee covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) is entitled to agencywide consideration for reemployment, and is not limited to consideration only at the facility at which he was last employed, unless the agency can show such circumstances that would preclude an agencywide search. <span class="Italic">See Withers,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. at 385<span class="Italic">; Phillips v. Department of Transportation,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 223, 226-27 (1984). The basis for affording such a agencywide right of priority consideration for reemployment under &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) is to provide qualifying former employees as full an opportunity as possible under the particular circumstances to be considered for reemployment with their agency. Such right to priority consideration for reemployment under &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), however, does not guarantee that a qualifying former employee will obtain reemployment. Further, the right to agencywide priority consideration for reemployment does not equate to a right of a former employee to unilaterally select a particular agency facility to which he will be considered for reemployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Former employees covered by the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act who meet the criteria for restoration are not merely entitled to consideration for reemployment, but are entitled "to employment to the position left, or to a position of like seniority, status, and pay, as a matter of <span class="Italic">right</span>." <span class="Italic">Malko v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 42, 45 (1980) (original emphasis). Although such employees' restoration rights are agencywide, the basic right is for restoration at the facility they left. While such employees and their agency may agree that they be restored at another facility, such agreement must be mutual. <span class="Italic">See Britton,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 172; FPM Ch. 353, Appendix B-3. The Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act and OPM's official guidance in the FPM do not afford covered former employees the unilateral right to be restored at a <span class="Italic">specific</span> facility other than the facility at which they were last employed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, appellant's basic right of restoration is to his former position at the agency's Brewster, New York, postal facility. If the agency cannot restore him to his former position at the Brewster facility, and if there is no equivalent position at that facility, he may be restored to a position of like seniority, status, and pay at another facility instead of the next best available position at the Brewster facility. Appellant and the agency may also mutually agree that he will be restored at another facility. <span class="Italic">See Britton,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 172; FPM Ch. 353, Appendix B-3. Appellant's November 26, 1985, letter to the agency's Brewster facility indicates that he understood that his right of restoration was to that facility and that assignment to the Anchorage facility was a discretionary reassignment. The Board concurs in the administrative judge's finding that the agency improperly based its denial of restoration on appellant's past performance. Appellant's remedy, however, is restoration as a matter of right to his former position or an equivalent position in the agency's Brewster facility. The Board finds that the administrative judge erred by determining that the agency improperly denied appellant restoration at its Anchorage facility.</p>

The appellant was apparently employed by the Department of the Army in 2005 when he took leave to perform military service.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regarding an employee's right to reemployment under USERRA, section 4312 provides that an employee is entitled to reemployment if the cumulative length of his service-related absences due to military service does not exceed 5 years, not counting excepted service periods. <span class="Italic">See Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 571 F.3d 1364, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Section 4312 also requires an employee to provide timely notification to his employer of his intention to return to work. In a case such as this, where the appellant was absent from his civilian position for more than 180 days due to military service, the appellant must submit an application for reemployment not later than 90 days after completing his military service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(e)(1)(D); <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied the appellant's request for corrective action on the basis that he failed to establish that he requested reemployment with the agency after he was transferred to his new position with another employer. Upon our review of the record, however, we find that, regardless of whether the appellant requested reemployment with the agency following his transfer, the agency satisfied its statutory obligation to reemploy the appellant following his military service when it returned him to duty on July 3, 2011. For the reasons that follow, because the agency restored the appellant to his prior position of employment following his military service, we find that it satisfied its restoration obligation under USERRA and therefore deny the appellant's request for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching her decision, the administrative judge concluded that USERRA permits an employee to make multiple requests for reemployment during the applicable time period. We find, however, that requiring an agency to reemploy an individual after he has been returned to duty following military service but voluntarily transfers out of that agency is not supported by the express language or purpose of USERRA's reemployment guarantee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interpretation of a statute begins with the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Resnick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 7 (2013). If the language provides a clear answer, the inquiry ends, and the plain meaning of the statute will be regarded as conclusive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(a)(3), any person whose absence from a position of employment is "necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed service" shall be entitled to the reemployment rights of 38 U.S.C. chapter 43 if, among other things, the person submits an application for reemployment to such employer in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312(e). <span id="Page_509"></span>Section 4312(e)(1), in turn, provides that an eligible person, "upon completion of a period of service in the uniformed service," shall notify the employer of the person's intent to return to a position of employment with the employer. Similarly, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a), which addresses the position to which a person is entitled upon reemployment, provides that a person entitled to reemployment under section 4312 "upon completion of a period of service in the uniformed services" shall be promptly reemployed in a position of employment. These provisions make clear that the absence from a position of employment must be necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed service, not by employment with another federal agency, and that a person's notification of intent to return must happen upon completion of a period of service in the uniformed service, not upon completion of such service <span class="Italic">and</span> additional service with another federal agency. <span class="Italic">See Francis v. Booz, Allen &#x0026; Hamilton, Inc.</span>, 452 F.3d 299, 303-04 (4th Cir. 2006) (sections 4312 and 4313 apply "only at the instant of reemployment"; under USERRA's comprehensive scheme, section 4312 only provides for immediate reemployment and does not prevent termination the next day or even later the same day; the apparent harshness of this result is addressed by sections 4311 and 4316, which prohibit discrimination after reemployment and protect covered individuals from dismissal except for cause for a period of time).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Congress enacted USERRA in order to eliminate disadvantages in civilian employment resulting from military service, not to extend to veterans greater employment rights in general. <span class="Italic">Bodus v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 508, &#x00B6; 13 (1999). One of the purposes of USERRA is to "minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services...by providing for the prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(2). To achieve this goal, USERRA provides that an employee returning from military service of greater than 90 days has a qualified right to reemployment "in the position of employment in which [he] would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service" or "in the position of employment in which [he] was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A)-(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the facts of this case, we find that the agency satisfied its statutory obligation to reemploy the appellant when it returned him to duty on July 3, 2011, and thereafter processed his voluntary request for a transfer to another federal agency 2 weeks later. We further find that the appellant's invocation of his reemployment rights seeking a return to the agency <span class="Italic">after</span> his voluntary transfer to another agency took place, derives from his new employer's decision finding him ineligible for special retirement eligibility coverage and is unrelated to his prior military service. Accordingly, because the appellant is not challenging a denial of reemployment following military service but rather is seeking to undo a voluntary transfer, which he was granted <span class="Italic">after</span> he returned to duty with his prior employer, we find that the appellant is not entitled to corrective action under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Cf. Pittman v. Department of Justice</span>, 486 F.3d 1276, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that because the employee "was reemployed...[he] received the full protections of his reemployment benefit under section 4312(a)"); <span class="Italic">Francis</span>, 452 F.3d at 304-05 (discussing USERRA's "functionally discrete" provisions and holding that section 4312 "only entitled a service person to immediate reemployment") (citation and quotation omitted).</p>
