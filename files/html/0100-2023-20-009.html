<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-10"><span class="space">c.</span> Abuse of Authority</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">D'Elia v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 226, 232-35 (1993), provided a comprehensive Board interpretation of the term "abuse of authority." The Board injected an element of gain or favoritism into the phrase, avoiding an interpretation that would define the term to encompass all allegations of mismanagement; however, "abuse of authority" is broad enough to cover actions taken to harm another:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not yet given a meaning to the term "abuse of authority" for purposes of the WPA. The legislative history of the initial whistleblower provisions, enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454 (Oct. 13, 1978), now codified in various portions of title 5 of the United States Code, does not suggest a definition for "abuse of authority." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730. However, the Special Counsel defined the term "abuse of authority" in prior regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regulations in effect before the enactment of the WPA defined "abuse of authority" as</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a Federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or that results in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred other persons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1250.3(f) (1988). Consistent with the general rules of statutory construction, Congress can be presumed to have known Special Counsel's definition of "abuse of authority" when it enacted the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Benifield v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 40 MSPR 50, 53 (1989). If Congress had intended that a different meaning be given to that term in the WPA, it could have expressed that intention when it enacted the WPA, and its failure to do so indicates a purpose not to. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the above definition, one element of abuse of authority is that the act results in personal gain or advantage to the official exercising power or to preferred other persons. The definition does not set forth a <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> standard. In contrast, the legislative history of the WPA indicates that Congress changed the term "mismanagement" in the CSRA to "gross mismanagement" in the WPA to establish a <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> standard for disclosures of mismanagement by protecting them only if they involved more than "trivial matters." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. 413, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 13. In enacting the WPA, however, Congress did not alter the term "abuse of authority" so as to indicate an intent to establish a <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> standard for disclosures of abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Nafus</span>, 57 MSPR at 394-95 (legislative history of the WPA shows that Congress intended change from "mismanagement" to "gross mismanagement" to reflect something blatant or out of the ordinary). Accordingly, we do not incorporate a <span class="Italic">de minimus</span> standard into the meaning of abuse of authority for purposes of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the foregoing, we conclude that two of the disclosures at issue in this appeal do not constitute disclosures of abuse of authority. However, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that one of his disclosures did in fact evidence an abuse of authority. In making these findings, we have considered, not only the appellant's evidence, but also the agency's evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466, 1473 (Fed. Cir.) (an agency may introduce relevant and competent evidence to counter evidence submitted by the appellant to prove that her disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's action), <span class="Italic">petition for cert. filed</span>, 62 U.S.L.W. 3275 (U.S. Sept. 29, 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reported that Mallinger was utilizing government equipment for personal reasons. The agency had initially authorized Mallinger to use the computer equipment at home. The appellant asserts that, sometime during 1989 or 1990, Mallinger told him that he enjoyed playing a particular computer game on the equipment. Assuming the truth of this allegation, we find that it would not constitute such an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power so as to constitute "abuse of authority," within the meaning of the WPA. And, although the appellant has recharacterized Mallinger's asserted use of the equipment as a violation of law or agency rule, this is not the characterization of the complaint as it was submitted to the Special Counsel. Thus, we cannot consider the alleged activity under that recharacterization. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 981 F.2d at 526.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant charged that Mallinger reassigned Koper from Washington, D.C., to a post of duty in Martinsburg, West Virginia, specifically for Koper's convenience. In his deposition testimony, Mallinger explained that Koper was applying for positions at the Martinsburg facility and that Koper had good prospects of being selected for a position there. Mallinger explained that because Koper was a good employee whom Mallinger <span id="Page_3602"></span>wished to keep at the agency, he agreed to change Koper's duty post to Martinsburg, West Virginia. We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant has not shown that Mallinger exceeded his authority in reassigning Koper under such circumstances, or, assuming the reassignment was improvident, that it constituted "abuse of authority" for purposes of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reported that while Koper was in active military duty, Mallinger approved time sheets that Mallinger knew Koper had falsified. The agency has asserted that during the four-month period when Koper was on active military duty, he worked for the agency. The agency states that, due to the enormity of its payroll, there may have been instances when Koper received pay for hours he did not work. We find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that Mallinger approved time sheets that Mallinger knew were false. If the appellant can prove this allegation, he will have shown that he disclosed information evidencing an abuse of authority under the WPA. Accordingly, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing to afford him the opportunity to make that showing....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation that he reasonably believed that he was disclosing abuse of authority when he reported Mallinger's alleged misuse of government equipment, alleged approval of falsified time sheets, and alleged approval of a change in duty station.

The appellant has failed to specify how Parris abused his authority in this regard since he, as the appellant's supervisor, and the Director of OTFM, was responsible for managing the affairs of the office. Although the appellant argues that the tribes have been financially disadvantaged by Parris' decision, he has not shown that this asserted adverse effect was due to anything other than the particular investment preference of Parris, an individual with expertise in, and overall responsibility for, making such decisions. Nor has the appellant shown that Parris' financial investment decisions inured to his personal benefit. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has failed to show that Parris abused his authority as that term has been defined, or that the appellant reasonably believed that he had.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although &#x00A7; 2302 does not define abuse of authority, related whistleblower-protection statutes do. The statute that extends whistleblower protections to employees of defense contractors defines it, in pertinent part, as "[a]n arbitrary and capricious exercise of authority that is inconsistent with the mission of the Department of Defense." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2409(g)(6)(1). Likewise, the statute that extends whistleblower protections to employees of other federal contractors defines it as "an arbitrary and capricious exercise of authority that is inconsistent with the mission of the executive agency concerned." 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(g)(1). Applying those broader definitions to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302, Dr. Smolinski's allegations evidence an abuse of authority. For whatever the Army's mission is, Col.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The crux of Mr. Gessel's allegations is that a non-supervisory coworker was rude, unpleasant, and physically intimidating and that Mr. Gessel was terminated for reporting the conduct. But the conduct reported does not reasonably fall within the categories of protected disclosures enumerated in the WPA: "(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has stated before OSC and the Board that he disclosed his perceptions of Mr. Tennant's preferential treatment of Ms. Prieto to several co-workers. He apparently characterized the alleged preferential treatment as an abuse of authority. He asserted that Mr. Tennant retaliated against him and forced his resignation because of the disclosures and because the appellant planned to report the purported abuse of authority to higher-ranking agency officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the content of those disclosures, the administrative judge found that the alleged intimate relationship between Mr. Tennant and Ms. Prieto did not appear to constitute an abuse of authority and that the appellant's disclosure thus was not protected. As an initial matter, we note that the appellant argued that an abuse of authority had been committed not simply because Mr. Tennant was allegedly having an intimate relationship with Ms. Prieto, but because he also purportedly granted her preferential treatment based on that alleged relationship. The Board has defined "abuse of authority" as an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a Federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or that results in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred other persons; the definition does not contain a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> threshold<span class="Italic">. See D'Elia v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 226, 232-33 (1993). The appellant's allegation of preferential treatment, based not on Ms. Prieto's merit but on Mr. Tennant's purported relationship with her, appears to fall within the bounds of that definition.

He further alleged that, when the first-level supervisor found out that he had disclosed the situation to Stipano in the fall of 2003, this supervisor confronted him and told him that he had made a serious mistake by complaining to Stipano and that he would regret it, i.e., that his supervisor "verbally threatened" him with implied adverse job consequences.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted that she objected to Garcia's reassignment because she was unqualified and that she "took the issue" to Turner. According to the appellant, Salazar then verbally reprimanded her for taking the problem to his supervisor, Turner. In her OSC complaint, she claimed that Garcia's reassignment violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 7.1 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(2), (6), and (10).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), an agency employee with the authority to take, recommend, or approve a personnel action is prohibited from granting any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation to any employee or applicant for the purpose of improving or harming the prospects of any particular individual for employment. Although the appellant did not list this subsection, we note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12) provides that it is prohibited to take or fail to take a personnel action if doing so violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing or directly concerning merit system principles. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301, the merit system principles mandate protection against personal favoritism and provide that recruitment should be from qualified individuals. Among the "personnel actions" covered by &#x00A7; 2302 are reassignments. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv); <span class="Italic">see Villamarzo v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 7 (2002) (indicating that the definition of "personnel actions" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) are to be used to determine if a prohibited personnel practice has occurred with regard to "personnel actions," as used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The lateral reassignment of Garcia to the G&#x0026;A position is therefore a personnel action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). Further, the appellant's contention that Salazar reassigned an unqualified employee to a position as a favor to others could constitute a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) and (12) because Garcia apparently was not entitled to any preference or advantage authorized by law, rule, or regulation.

<p class="Body-Text">An earlier Board decision recognized that, although manipulation of appointment procedures may warrant disciplinary or corrective action in a case brought by OSC, disclosure of unfair selection practices, interpreted by the Board as encompassing an allegation of an abuse of authority, did not rise to the level of whistleblowing covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(8). The Board's opinion was contrary to the plain language of the statutes it interpreted. The Board relied on and probably misinterpreted a Federal Circuit case by reading into the decision more than the decision fairly expressed. Under <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/THOMAS_KENN_W_AT_1221_96_0406_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199877.pdf">77 MSPR 224</a>, 231-33 (1998), <span class="Italic">overruled</span>, <span class="Italic">Ganski v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">At issue in <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span> was whether certain disclosures made to the agency's Inspector General (IG) were protected under section 2302(b)(8) or under section 2302(b)(9). In distinguishing between the two types of disclosures, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The "IG disclosure" might reveal violations of regulations, gross mismanagement, and abuse of authority on the part of the agency in conducting its selection process. <span class="Italic">On the other hand, the "grievance disclosure" could challenge the selection process as being unfair and inequitable to the employee because the agency considered nonmerit factors in denying him a promotion opportunity</span>. Thus, the same operative facts supporting an employment grievance may also give rise to questions of government violations of law or gross mismanagement and waste.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">However, not every disclosure to the IG pertaining to personnel actions can rise to the level of a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure. An employee does not necessarily make a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure merely by informing the IG of an adverse personnel action and alleging that it evidences mismanagement or the like. This would convert grievances based on section 2302(b)(9) into cases appealable to the Board under the WPA, a result Congress clearly did not intend. The facts underlying a section 2302(b)(9) disclosure can serve as the basis for a section 2302(b)(8) disclosure only if they establish the type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7 F.3d at 1035 (emphasis added, citations deleted). We conclude from the above that a disclosure which alleges only that an agency's selection process was unfair because the agency considered nonmerit factors is not the "type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach," even if made outside of the grievance process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To a considerable extent, the appellant's disclosures to OSC and members of Congress consisted of allegations that the agency's selection process was unfair and based on nonmerit factors. In his first agency grievance and OSC complaint he alleged, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: (1) persons with less experience and qualifications than he were selected; (2) one individual was selected who was not qualified at all; (3) a position was offered to and accepted by an individual who had resigned in lieu of termination; and (4) even though applicants for Special Agent positions had been told that if they did not accept a location offered they would be removed from the eligibility list, two selectees were allowed to accept positions in other offices after declining offers for one location. The appellant alleged that these practices violated the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301 and 2302 and various provisions in the agency's Merit Promotion Plan and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2301 provides broadly that "[r]ecruitment should be from qualified individuals" and that "selection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1). Section 2302(b)(6) describes a particular nonmerit-based selection process--where an unauthorized preference or advantage is granted to an employee or applicant for employment for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of a particular person for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An allegation that a selection process was unfair because it was based on nonmerit factors would necessarily imply a violation of section 2301. Similarly, an allegation that unauthorized preferences or advantages were extended to some applicants for vacancies, but not to others, might raise a violation of section 2302(b)(6). In making these types of allegations in his letters to OSC and members of Congress, the appellant thus made nonfrivolous allegations that the agency violated these two statutory sections. In light of the Federal Circuit's guidance in <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, however, that an individual's challenge to an agency's selection process as "unfair and inequitable to the employee because the agency considered nonmerit factors in denying him a promotion opportunity," is not the "type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach," we conclude that the appellant's allegations of a violation of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301 and 2302(b)(6) were not whistleblowing disclosures under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant's allegations that the agency violated its Merit Promotion Plan and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy were very similar in nature to his allegations that it violated 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301-2302. Accordingly, violations of these policies would similarly not be the type of fraud, waste, or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach. We therefore need not determine whether these agency policies were rules or regulations within the meaning of section 2302(b)(8).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Following his refusal to sign off on the Govplace invoice, the appellant described a meeting among him, Harvey, and Boyles that he characterized as exhibiting an abuse of authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">After Appellant's refusal to sign off on the Govplace invoice, the relationship between Appellant and Mr. Harvey and Mr. Boyles deteriorated quickly. In late November 2008, Appellant, Mr. Harvey, and Mr. Boyles met in Mr. Harvey's office. Mr. Harvey berated Appellant for not overseeing the work of the contractors employed in the Division. Mr. Harvey made veiled threats about Appellant's employment, stating that "you should watch out for your wife and kids and think about them."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Appellant told Mr. Harvey that he had had concerns regarding the minimal staffing levels in the OCIO, and that there was no way in which their office could hold accountable the approximately sixty (60) contractors without additional staff. Appellant reminded Mr. Harvey that Appellant had sent an email requesting additional staff for this purpose, and that Mr. Harvey had not taken any action to remedy the situation. Appellant then confronted Mr. Harvey's accusations that Appellant was incompetent. Appellant described the intense work schedule that he had maintained over the past several months. Mr. Harvey abruptly announced that the meeting was over, stating that he and Mr. Boyles would talk, and that they would "fix" Appellant. Appellant understood Mr. Harvey's words as a threat to make his job more difficult.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant said he reported this matter to human resources officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Turning to the merits of this claim, the Board has found that a supervisor's use of his influence to denigrate staff members and to threaten their careers constitutes an abuse of authority, and that there is no <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard for such abuse under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Pasley</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 105, &#x00B6; 18. We find that Harvey's alleged statements were clearly denigrating and threatening in nature, and that the appellant's <span id="Page_3606"></span>disclosure of these statements to human resources officials constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation of a disclosure of an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the net effect of Harvey's and Boyle's wrongdoing was to undermine his ability to perform the duties of his position successfully:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By the end of March 2009, Appellant found that the impediments that Mr. Boyles had created left Appellant unable to provide services to his clients in a timely manner. In March 2009, Appellant sent several emails to Mr. Boyles to discuss the projects that needed completion, but Mr. Boyles did not respond. Appellant's inability to meet his performance goals and Mr. Boyles's failure to provide Appellant with the most basic support left him vulnerable to criticisms of his performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have found that the appellant's disclosures regarding the alleged inadequacy of his supervisors' responses to his reports that contractors were not meeting their contractual obligations did not rise to level of a protected disclosure, we find that these allegations, combined with the alleged effect of his supervisors' directives that he violate ethical obligations, together with allegations of the unfair distribution of work, the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Herman v. DOJ</span>, 115 MSPR 386, 391-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 2011 MSPB 4 (2011) (on further remand, <span class="Italic">Herman v. DOJ</span>, 119 MSPR 642, 2013 MSPB 60 (2013)), abuse of authority included derogatory statements about the appellant and similar supervisory conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also disclosed that his supervisor issued and then retracted a letter of counseling to the appellant, made log entries derogatory of him, and detailed him to another position while indicating that, if he applied for a position elsewhere, she would make this all go away. An abuse of authority occurs when there is an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or results in personal gain or advantage to himself or preferred other persons. There is no <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard for abuse of authority as a basis of a protected disclosure under the WPA. Harassment or intimidation of other employees may constitute an abuse of authority. A supervisor's use of his influence to denigrate other staff members in an abusive manner and to threaten the careers of staff members with whom he disagrees constitutes abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. Department of Defense</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 37 (2007); <span class="Italic">see Jessup v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 8 (2007). We find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he disclosed an abuse of authority. A disinterested observer could reasonably conclude that the supervisor's alleged action, threatening the appellant's career by indicating that the derogatory personnel action would go away if the appellant would find another career path, constituted an abuse of authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant disclosed that, during program reviews, the appellant's first and second level supervisors arrived late, were not interacting with the team, made sarcastic and inappropriate comments in front of the team, and delegated to an inmate orderly the handling of sensitive documents. The administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's disclosures were within the normal performance of his job duties. The appellant's duties as an examiner included reviewing the institutional operations to ensure that there was not waste, fraud, or abuse; they did not include disclosing the illegal abuse of authority by his supervisors. <span class="Italic">See Kahn</span>, 528 F.3d 1336. We find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of abuse of authority by disclosing that his supervisors harassed or intimidated the review team by making sarcastic remarks in front of them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that discussions and disagreements over job related duties is a normal part of most positions, and not every complaint about the employee's disagreement with the supervisor's conduct is protected by the WPA. <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (the WPA is not a weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct). However, in this case, the matter appears beyond a simple dispute between an employee and a supervisor, at least for purposes of assessing whether the appellant has presented a nonfrivolous allegation establishing jurisdiction over his IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See generally Swanson</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 11. Thus, there remain issues of fact that require further development on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Within the Board's IRA jurisdiction was a nonfrivolous allegation that the appellant, a supervisory police officer, informed his supervisors that an investigation of another officer violated specific agency rules and procedures and constituted gross mismanagement and abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Stover v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 63 MSPR 46, 50 (1994). But a claim that an existing policy ought to be changed, essentially an appellant's claim that he should obtain a privilege he had not enjoyed before, did not rise to the level of a disclosure of gross mismanagement or abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 455, 458-59 (1994) (complaint by an appellant, a federal police officer, that the policy should be changed so that he was not required to turn in his shield and identification at the end of a shift); <span class="Italic">Coons v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 485, 489 (1994) (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without an element of the disclosure of some form of favoritism, self-dealing, or unjustified harm to the rights of others, an allegation of abuse of authority is not likely to support an whistleblowing assertion, as <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <span class="blue">103 MSPR 375</span>, 389 &#x00B6; 27, 2006 MSPB 279 (2006) (partially aff'd, vacated, and remanded on other grounds in <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 515 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008), following remand, still affirming removal, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 110 MSPR 321, 2009 MSPB 3 (2009), again remanded, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2010), following second court remand, ordering reinstatement, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CHAMBERS_TERESA_C_DC_1221_04_0616_M_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_566514.pdf">116 MSPR 17</a>, 2011 MSPB 7 (2011)), implied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also did not reveal an "abuse of authority" to the Post reporter. An "abuse of authority" is "an "arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or that results in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred other persons." <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (citations omitted). Here, the appellant has not shown that she reasonably believed that the executive and legislative officials with whom she disagreed were engaged in self-dealing or depriving people of their rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chambers, supra</span>, also suggested that the allegation that a manager broke his promise not to reveal the existence of a reprimand to the personnel office did not constitute the protected disclosure of an abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Chambers, supra</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CHAMBERS_TERESA_C_DC_1221_04_0616_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_DISSENT_247802.pdf">103 MSPR 375</a>, 390 &#x00B6; 31. A report of "simple rudeness," described as "interruptions and bumping into the back of the appellant's chair," did not rise to the level of a report of abuse of authority in <span class="Italic">Ivey v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 94 MSPR 224 (2003). A report that an agency employee used derogatory names to refer to employees of other agencies may have been unprofessional, but it did not equate a report of abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Matias v. DHS,</span> SF-1221-13-0178-W-2 (NP 4/14/2015). <span class="Italic">But see Ahmad v. VA</span>, CH-1221-12-0462-W-2 (NP 10/17/2022) (suggesting an abuse of authority: "he disclosed that the Performance Improvement Department was maintaining illegal files on providers and discriminatorily using the information to criticize the providers' work without giving constructive assistance, as well as conducting sham peer reviews").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the Board considers an IRA complaint alleging reprisal for a report of abuse of authority, the Board permitted an AJ to presume good faith on the part of agency officials and then evaluate for jurisdictional purposes, without a hearing, the alleged abusive practices on the basis of the information placed before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pulcini v. SSA</span>, 83 MSPR 685, 691 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (1999). That presumption has not been reiterated in Board decisions.
