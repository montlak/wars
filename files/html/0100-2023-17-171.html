<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-169"><span class="space">a.</span> Conflict Between Contract Provisions and Government-Wide Regulations, Agency Rules and Regulations</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7117:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the duty to bargain in good faith shall, to the extent not inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation, extend to matters which are the subject of any rule or regulation only if the rule or regulation is not a Government-wide rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7116:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this chapter, it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(7)&#x2003;to enforce any rule or regulation (other than a rule or regulation implementing section 2302 of this title) which is in conflict with any applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7116(a)(7) states a principle requiring agencies to defer to contract provisions that precede an agency rule or regulation. The statute does not furnish the basis for an exception to an arbitration award that arguably fails to enforce a contract provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2142 and Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot</span>, 58 FLRA 692, 693 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Campbell Dist., Third Region and AFGE Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 190-95 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>), involving review of a decision sustaining a grievance protesting the withholding, in accordance with agency rules, of amounts allegedly falsely claimed through travel vouchers, FLRA explained the nature of the exception based on a conflict between an arbitration award and a government-wide or agency regulation or rule. Government-wide rules or regulations always control if they were in effect prior to the creation of the contract with a conflicting provision. Government-wide rules or regulations do not override preexisting contract provisions unless the rule or regulation implements 5 USC 2302, describing prohibited personnel practices. For purposes of &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) of the Statute, the term "rule or regulation" includes agency rules and regulations that are mandatory and prescriptive in their application. A conflict with agency rules and regulations will provide a basis for finding an award deficient under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) when those rules or regulations govern the disposition of the matter resolved by the arbitration award. Agency rules or regulations only govern the disposition, however, when they do not conflict with provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and FLRA will not provide controlling weight to agency regulations that conflict with provisions of a contract on the basis of a compelling need justification that can be waived during negotiations and that can only be resolved through a negotiability appeal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case provides us with an opportunity to clearly set forth the approach we will take in resolving exceptions to arbitration awards where it is contended that the award is deficient because it is contrary to an agency rule or regulation.&#x2003;For the reasons set forth below, we will find an award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) when the award conflicts with an agency rule or regulation so long as the rule or regulation governs the matter in dispute; that is, the rule or regulation applies to the matter in dispute and does not conflict with similarly applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. We hold that the contrary policy established by the Council under the Order has been superseded by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rules and Regulations Within the Meaning of Section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has clearly indicated that the terms "rule, or regulation" as used in section 7122(a)(1) include any enforceable Government-wide rule or regulation. Therefore, when the party excepting to an arbitration award has established that the award is contrary to an enforceable Government-wide rule or regulation, the Authority has found the award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Chicago, Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1395,</span> 34 FLRA 1107 (1990) (award contrary to 41 C.F.R. 101-18.101).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not established such a clear approach concerning the effect of agency rules or regulations under section 7122(a)(1). In a number of cases, the Authority denied exceptions contending that the award was deficient because it was contrary to an agency regulation. However, in those cases, the Authority denied the exceptions because the excepting party failed to establish that the award was contrary to the agency regulation; the Authority expressly noted that it was not deciding whether the agency regulation constituted a "rule, or regulation" within the meaning of section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example, American Federation of Government Employees, San Francisco Region and Office of Program Operations, Field Operations, Social Security Administration, San Francisco Region,</span> 7 FLRA 622, 625 &#x0026; n.6. (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without any discussion of the meaning of the terms "rule" and "regulation" under section 7122(a)(1), the Authority, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and National Treasury Employees Union,</span> 32 FLRA 934, 939 (1988), denied an exception contending that the award conflicted with an agency directive because the directive did not constitute a Government-wide rule or regulation. Also without <span id="page_1958"></span>discussion, the Authority, in <span class="Italic">Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot, Lexington, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 894,</span> 24 FLRA 50, 54-55 (1986), denied an exception contending that the award conflicted with an agency regulation because the agency regulation was not a regulation for which there was a compelling need under the Authority's rules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now specifically hold, for the reasons which follow, that we will find an award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) when the award conflicts with a governing agency rule or regulation. We reach this conclusion after examining the language of section 7122(a)(1) and the statutory framework with respect to the provisions concerning rules, regulations, and collective bargaining agreements that govern the disposition and resolution of grievances. To the extent that Authority decisions have taken a different approach to these cases, they will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a) of the Statute sets forth the grounds on which the Authority will find an arbitration award deficient, one of which is that the award is "contrary to any...rule, or regulation[.]" Based on the plain wording of the Statute, we conclude that the term "any rule or regulation" encompasses agency, as well as Government-wide, rules or regulations and that, therefore, an agency rule or regulation may provide a basis for finding an arbitration award deficient. We further hold, however, that only an arbitration award that conflicts with a rule or regulation that governs the matter in dispute will be found to be deficient under section 7122(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether a rule or regulation governs a matter in dispute requires consideration of the regulatory framework that applies to many aspects of the employment relationship between Federal employees and their employing agencies.&#x2003;That framework includes both Government-wide rules and regulations and agency rules and regulations. The determination of whether a rule or regulation governs a matter in dispute also requires consideration of the application and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements under the Statute in relation to these rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Government-wide rules or regulations are rules, regulations, or official declarations of policy that are generally applicable throughout the Federal Government and are binding on the Federal agencies and Federal officials to which they apply. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 6 and Internal Revenue Service, New Orleans District,</span> 3 FLRA 747, 754-55 (1980). Under section 7117 of the Statute, Government-wide rules and regulations bar the negotiation of, and agreement on, union proposals that conflict with them. Accordingly, Government-wide rules and regulations govern a matter in dispute to which they apply, even if the same matter is covered by a collective bargaining agreement under the Statute. The only limitation on the supremacy of Government-wide rules or regulations is set forth in section 7116(a)(7) of the Statute, which makes it an unfair labor practice for an agency "to enforce any rule or regulation (other than a rule or regulation implementing section 2302 of this title) which is in conflict with any applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed[.]" Thus, under section 7116(a)(7), a Government-wide rule or regulation, which does not implement 5 U.S.C. 2302, is not controlling with respect to a conflicting provision of a collective bargaining agreement that was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed. Therefore, we will not find an arbitration award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) as contrary to a Government-wide rule or regulation (other than one implementing section 2302) when the award is consistent with an applicable collective bargaining agreement that was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed. Otherwise, we will continue to apply section 7122(a)(1) to find all arbitration awards that conflict with a Government-wide rule or regulation to be deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to such generally applicable Government-wide rules and regulations, each Federal agency prescribes rules, regulations, and official declarations of policy to govern and control the resolution of matters to which they apply within the agency. For example, in <span class="Italic">Local 2855, AFGE v. U.S.,</span> 602 F.2d 574, 581 (3d Cir. 1979), the court noted that, under 5 U.S.C. 301, Congress has invested the heads of every executive and military department with general authority to prescribe regulations for the governing of their departments and the conduct of their employees and that, under 5 U.S.C. 302, the heads of departments are permitted to delegate to subordinate officials the authority invested in them to take final action on matters pertaining to employment, direction, and general administration of personnel of their agencies. Furthermore, the dominance of agency rules and regulations was acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA,</span> 110 S. Ct. 2043, 2051 (1990), when the Court noted the "familiar rule of administrative law that an agency must abide by its own regulations." The Court also recognized, however, that the Statute, in the circumstances set forth in section 7117(a)(2), permits the parties to bargain over matters covered by those regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, under the statutory framework, collective bargaining agreements, and not agency rules and regulations, govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply when there is a conflict between the agreement and the rule or regulation. We reach this conclusion on the basis of the scope of bargaining prescribed under the Statute. Consistent with section 7117, duly authorized representatives of an agency may agree to provisions in a collective bargaining agreement, notwithstanding the existence of conflicting agency rules or regulations. As discussed above, they may not do so in face of conflicting Government-wide rules or regulations. Only agency rules and regulations for which there is a compelling need within the meaning of section 7117(a)(2) of the Statute and section 2424.11 of the Authority rules may bar negotiation of conflicting union proposals. We deem it critical to our analysis of this issue that nothing in the Statute prevents an agency from agreeing to collective bargaining agreement provisions that alter or modify the policies established by an agency rule or regulation, even one for which a compelling need has been established. As the U.S. Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Aberdeen Proving Ground,</span> 108 S. Ct. 1261, 1262 (1988), compelling need determinations can be made only in negotiability proceedings and a negotiability proceeding cannot arise until an agency alleges a matter to be nonnegotiable. For this reason, we conclude that provisions that become part of a collective bargaining agreement take precedence over agency rules and regulations with respect to matters to which they both apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, for purposes of section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute, the term "rule or regulation" must be defined to include agency rules and regulations that are mandatory and prescriptive in their application. A conflict with agency rules and regulations will provide a basis for finding an award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) when such rules or regulations govern the disposition of the matter resolved by the arbitration award. Agency rules and regulations may only govern the disposition of matters to which they apply, however, when the rules and regulations do not conflict with provisions of an applicable collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, we will apply section 7122(a)(1) to find an arbitration award deficient when the award is contrary to an agency rule or regulation unless the award enforces a conflicting provision of an applicable collective bargaining agreement that governs the matter in dispute.[2]</p>

As noted above, the enforcement of statutory laws--even when they conflict with collective-bargaining agreements--does not violate the Statute.[16] Therefore, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency did not repudiate the parties' agreement by implementing the policy is consistent with Authority precedent.[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Collective bargaining agreements, and not agency regulations, govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply. <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>, 37 FLRA at 194. The Arbitrator interpreted the parties' agreement as establishing an entitlement to temporary promotions. Accordingly, the contract, not the Directive, governs the matter in dispute and we deny this Agency exception.[7] We note that, as plainly worded and interpreted by the Arbitrator, the parties' agreement provides that temporary promotions are to be handled in accordance with the Directive. As such, the agreement effectively incorporates the Directive. Where an agency regulation with which an award allegedly conflicts has been incorporated in a collective bargaining agreement, the matter becomes one of contract interpretation. <span class="Italic">Panama Canal</span> <span class="Italic">Commission and International Association of Firefighters</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 13</span>, 41 FLRA 284, 292-93 (1991)....&#8197;As such, we will determine whether the award draws its essence from the bargaining agreement provision which incorporates the Directive. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 293.</p>

That is, it appears that during the arbitration proceeding, the Agency itself effectively interpreted the Directive in a manner that would not render the award deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute. Where an agency previously acted in a manner inconsistent with the interpretation of an agency regulation it asserted in support of an exception to an award, the Authority refused to defer to that interpretation. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Medical Facility for Federal Prisons and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1612</span>, 51 FLRA No. 91 (1996).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...It is well established that "nothing in the Statute prevents an agency from agreeing to collective bargaining agreement provisions that alter or modify the policies established by an agency rule or regulation...." <span class="Italic">Fort Campbell</span>, 37 FLRA at 194. For this reason, a collective bargaining agreement, and not an agency regulation, will govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> In addition, where an agency regulation with which an award allegedly conflicts has been incorporated in a collective bargaining agreement, the interpretation and application of the regulation is an issue of contract interpretation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission and International Association of Firefighters, Local 13</span>, 41 FLRA 284, 292-93 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">A conflict between an agency regulation and contract analysis in an award was considered in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo and IFPTE Local 11</span>, 49 FLRA 510, 516 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has failed to establish that the award is deficient on the ground that it conflicts with an Agency regulation.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Campbell District, Third Region, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 195 (1990), we stated that "[a] conflict with agency rules and regulations will provide a basis for finding an award deficient under section 7122(a)(1) when such rules or regulations govern the disposition of the matter resolved by the arbitration award." A rule or regulation governs the matter in dispute when it "applies to the matter in dispute and does not conflict with similarly applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 190.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency has not shown that CPI 630, the regulation on which it relies, is applicable to the issue before the Arbitrator or that the Arbitrator's award conflicts with that regulation. In resolving the issue before him, the Arbitrator addressed whether the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement by requiring employees to take annual leave during the shutdown of June 29 through July 4, 1992. The Arbitrator found that the parties had negotiated provisions relating to the administration of annual leave in their agreement and he found that nothing in those negotiated provisions allowed the Agency to require the use of annual leave during the shutdown. He also found no past practice that would permit the Agency to require employees to use annual leave during that time. The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's argument that CPI 630 was applicable. Rather, he found that the shutdown of the Agency did not fit into the categories of circumstances justifying forced annual leave set forth in CPI 630. In sum, the Arbitrator found that the parties' collective bargaining agreement and not the regulation controlled the outcome in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">To constitute a conflict with regulation, the arbitrator's determination must be inconsistent with the plain wording of the regulation or be otherwise impermissible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Atlanta and NFFE Local 2102</span>, 44 FLRA 427, 433 (1992). The arbitrator's job is to determine whether a conflict exists, and to determine whether the agency's interpretation of its own regulation is consistent with or contrary to the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and Nat'l INS Serv. Council, Local 46 AFGE</span>, 48 FLRA 1269, 1276 (1993). The parties may by agreement exclude the interpretation of agency regulations from the scope of arbitral authority under their agreement.

<p class="noindent">It appears that FLRA will honor provisions of an agreement that preclude government-wide regulations from becoming preclusive following renegotiation of an agreement, if the underlying agreement contains provisions limiting the automatic effect of government-wide regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq.

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a) of the Statute provides, as relevant here, that an arbitration award is deficient if it conflicts with a governing rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Campbell District, Third Region, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 195 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Fort Campbell</span>).

Collective bargaining agreements, and not agency rules and regulations, govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply when there is a conflict between the agreement and the rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 194. Nothing in the Statute prevents an agency from agreeing to collective bargaining agreement provisions that modify policies established by an agency rule or regulation, and a provision that has become part of a collective bargaining agreement takes precedence over agency rules and regulations with respect to matters to which they both apply. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission and International Association of Firefighters, Local 13</span>, 41 FLRA 284 (1991), the Authority concluded, consistent with the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Fort Campbell</span>, that when a collective bargaining agreement incorporates the regulations with which the award allegedly conflicts, the matter becomes one of contract interpretation because the agreement, not the regulation, now governs the matter in dispute. 41 FLRA at 292-93. We find that the agreement in this case incorporates the regulations with which the award allegedly conflicts. Consequently, the issue before us is whether the Arbitrator's award draws its essence from the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">A grievance settlement is essentially treated as a component of the negotiated agreement, meaning it takes precedence over an arguably conflicting agency regulation under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS,</span> 64 FLRA 262, 263 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the general principle under the Statute that "collective bargaining agreements, rather than agency wide regulations, govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply[,]" the Authority has held that otherwise-enforceable contract provisions control any matter to which they apply even if they are inconsistent with the Agency's personnel management system regulations. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed.
