<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-154"><span id="Page_2214"></span><span class="space">6.</span> Effect of Grant of Disability Retirement Application on Action Based on Inability to Perform Duties</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may receive an adverse action appeal based on a removal for physical inability to perform a job from an individual who then applies for and receives disability retirement (or Social Security disability benefits). The appellant may assert that he has been the victim of disability discrimination because the agency failed to accommodate adequately the disability that led to the retirement annuity determination. A precondition of the award of the disability retirement annuity was the agency's certification that it could not accommodate the appellant's condition. The adverse action appeal challenges the agency's representations to OPM. Summarizing <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 648, 661 &#x00B6; 29 (1999),<span class="Italic"> post,</span> under <span class="Italic">Shy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 218, 220 &#x00B6; 5 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 MSPR 648 (1999),...the Board held that receipt of disability retirement benefits does not estop an appellant, as a matter of law, from attempting to prove that an adverse action was taken improperly and in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791, because of disability discrimination. Thus, the fact that the Office of Personnel Management granted the appellant's application is not a basis to dismiss the appeal, which was within the Board's jurisdiction, and its accompanying claim of disability discrimination. Rather, as the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Lamberson</span>, it will employ a case-by-case approach in determining the effect of an appellant's application for or receipt of a disability retirement award upon a claim of disability discrimination<span class="Italic">. Lamberson</span>, 80 MSPR at &#x00B6; 30. Thus, the appellant's receipt of disability retirement benefits was not a proper basis upon which to dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lamberson v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 648, 55-62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-32 (1999), decided that appeals would be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a disability retirement based, in part, on an agency certification that no accommodation was possible would bar an adverse action appeal based on a claim of disability discrimination. The determinative factors include (1) the definition of "disability" on a benefits application; (2) the manner the disability benefits application provides for the applicant to describe his condition (i.e., in writing and in a narrative format, by merely checking boxes, or in an oral description over the telephone); (3) the applicant's representations versus relevant documents including disability reports and doctors' reports regarding his medical condition; (4) the circumstances leading to the disability benefits application, including whether the applicant was denied reasonable accommodation, or applied for benefits at the employer's insistence or on a doctor's advice; and (5) the applicant's health condition at the time of his application for disability benefits versus his condition at the time of the alleged disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e must decide whether the appellant's receipt of a disability retirement award judicially estops her from asserting in this appeal that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate her condition, that is, that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791. In the first place, it is questionable whether judicial estoppel applies under the circumstances presented in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine which is used by courts to "bar[ ] a party from adopting inconsistent positions in the same or related litigation." <span class="Italic">United States v. 49.01 Acres of Land</span>, 802 F.2d 387, 390 (10th Cir. 1986). As at least one court has stated, it is inappropriate to apply judicial estoppel to statements made in the context of an application for disability benefits under the Social Security Act (SSA) because to do so would supplant the truth-seeking function of the court "by an agency administrative decision rendered without an evidentiary hearing." <span class="Italic">Griffith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</span> 135 F.3d 376, 382 (6th Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there was no litigation surrounding the appellant's application for disability benefits, and thus no prior proceedings before either the Board or a court on the issue of whether she could perform her position with accommodation. Thus, applying judicial estoppel to OPM's administrative decision to award the appellant a disability benefit would, as stated above, arguably supplant the Board's function of determining, in a fully litigated appeal of the agency's removal action, whether the appellant could have been accommodated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, a number of courts have applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel in deciding whether statements made by a plaintiff in an application for SSA disability benefits bar a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), Pub. L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Haschmann v. Time Warner Entertainment</span> <span class="Italic">Co.,</span> 151 F.3d 591, 603 (7th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Rascon v. U.S. West Communications, Inc.,</span> 143 F.3d 1324, 1332 (10th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Oregon,</span> 141 F.3d 1361, 1368-69 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Swanks v. Washington Metro</span>politan <span class="Italic">Area Transit Authority,</span> 116 F.3d 582, 587 (D.C. Cir. 1997). In addition, the Ninth Circuit has observed, "prior representations on disability benefits applications may demonstrate that a claimant is playing fast and loose with the courts, seeking advantage by advancing mutually exclusive contentions before the courts and benefits providers," and in such cases, the use of judicial estoppel to bar an ADA claim would be within a tribunal's discretion. <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 141 F.3d at 1369. Thus, as explained below, although the appellant's receipt of a disability retirement award does not automatically bar her from alleging that the agency's removal action was based on disability discrimination, the administrative judge may consider statements made by the appellant in her disability application to determine what, if any, effect those statements may have on the appellant's allegation of disability discrimination in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to a claim that an employer has violated the ADA, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has posited that because of the fundamental differences between the ADA and disability programs administered by both the Social Security Administration and private disability insurers, representations made in connection with an application for benefits under the SSA and private disability programs are relevant to, but not determinative of, whether a person is a qualified individual with a disability. Thus, according to the EEOC, such representations are not an automatic bar, via judicial estoppel, to a subsequent ADA claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Enforcement Guidance: "Effect of Representations Made in Applications for Disability Benefits on the Determination of Whether a Person Is a 'Qualified Individual with a Disability' Under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990" (hereinafter Enforcement Guidance) 9, 20-21 (Feb. 12, 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC has outlined the statutory differences between the SSA and ADA as including, among other things, the fact that: (1) The ADA has a broad remedial purpose to prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities who want to work and are qualified to work, whereas the SSA's disability programs provide income to individuals with disabilities who are generally unable to work; (2) the ADA mandates an individualized assessment of a particular individual's capabilities, whereas the SSA permits general presumptions about an individual's ability to work; and (3) the ADA looks at whether the individual can work with reasonable accommodation, whereas the SSA does not consider this question. Enforcement Guidance at 9, 12-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, the standards applicable to OPM's consideration of an applicant's entitlement to disability benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) appear more akin to the standards for proof of discrimination claims filed under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act than are the standards applicable to SSA disability determinations. For instance, CSRS and FERS regulations require both the "individual assessment" missing from SSA analyses and a showing that the agency was unable to reasonably accommodate an employee's medical condition in her position. However, for the following reasons, we find that judicial estoppel should not be used as an automatic bar to a claim of disability discrimination where the appellant has applied for or received CSRS or FERS disability benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our examination of CSRS and FERS applications for disability retirement discloses that they do not contain any specific questions to which the applicant must respond that address the issue of reasonable accommodation. Only the "Supervisor's Statement," attesting to an employee's disability, mentions accommodation by asking what efforts, in the supervisor's knowledge, have been made to accommodate the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> SF-2824D ("Agency Certification of Reassignment and Accommodation Efforts in Connection With Disability Retirement Under the Civil Service Retirement System"); SF-3105D ("Agency Certification of Reassignment and Accommodation Efforts in Connection With Disability Retirement Under the Federal Employees' Retirement System"). As a consequence, an award of disability retirement from OPM is not an assurance that an agency has considered all avenues of reasonable accommodation for purposes of our assessment of whether the disability award is inconsistent with a subsequent claim of disability discrimination, nor is such an award necessarily an affirmation by the appellant that she could not be accommodated. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ovedon v. Reilly,</span> 977 F.2d 1190, 1196 (7th Cir. 1992) (a finding of disability by the Social Security Administration should not be given preclusive effect in a Rehabilitation Act case); <span class="Italic">Sumner v. Michelin North America</span>, Inc., 966 F. Supp. 1567, 1575 (M.D. Ala. 1997) ("[A] person may be totally and permanently disabled for workers' compensation purposes and yet still be able to perform a position's essential functions with or without accommodation."). Thus, we find that it would be inappropriate to estop an appellant from asserting a disability discrimination claim merely because she either applied for or is in receipt of CSRS or FERS disability benefits. Our conclusion on this point is supported by the CSRS and FERS disability provisions and their legislative histories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(a), an employee subject to the CSRS is eligible for receipt of disability retirement if, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, he or she is unable to render useful and efficient service in his or her position and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is not qualified for reassignment...to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.... [A]n employee of <span id="Page_2215"></span>the United States Postal Service shall be considered not qualified for a reassignment...if the reassignment is to a position in a different craft or is inconsistent with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement covering the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B), (a)(2)(A), an employee subject to the FERS is not eligible for disability retirement if</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">he can render useful and efficient service in his position; or he has declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in [his] agency for which [he] is qualified if the position--(i) is at the same grade (or pay level) as the employee's most recent grade (or pay level) or higher; (ii) is within the employee's commuting area; and (iii) is one in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRS provision was added as part of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-499, 94 Stat. 2599. The legislative history of this Act, which was enacted after the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, shows congressional intent that "[i]f the employee is able to perform useful and efficient service in another position and a vacancy exists, the employee must be reassigned rather than retired." H.R. Rep. No. 96-1167, at 206 (1980), reprinted in 1980 USCCAN 5526, 5651. Thus, to foreclose a disability discrimination claim that could, if proven, reinstate an employee simply because that employee has applied for or received a federal disability benefit would thwart Congress's intent that continuation of work with accommodation is preferred over disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are persuaded as well by the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit's treatment of this issue in <span class="Italic">Talavera v. School Board of</span> <span class="Italic">Palm Beach</span> County, 129 F.3d 1214 (11th Cir. 1997). There, a secretary, who was required to stand four to five hours a day, requested reasonable accommodation for her back problems (chronic osteoarthritis). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1214. While bedridden, she applied for social security disability benefits and made statements to the effect that she "had good skills," her "mind was intact, but that [her] physical appearance [was] a deterrent" because she could "no longer walk, bend, etc." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Social Security Administration found her totally disabled and awarded her benefits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thereafter, she filed a disability discrimination suit in the district court on the grounds that her employer had failed to reasonably accommodate her disability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1216.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court reversed the district court's finding that because of her application for and receipt of disability benefits she was judicially estopped from claiming that she was an otherwise qualified person with a disability. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1217, 1220. In so holding, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A certification of total disability on [a Social Security disability (SSD)] application does mean that the applicant cannot perform the essential functions of her job without reasonable accommodation. It does not necessarily mean that the applicant cannot perform the essential functions of her job with reasonable accommodation. Whether in any particular situation there is an inconsistency between applying for SSD benefits and bringing an ADA claim will depend upon the facts of the case, including the specific representations made in the application for disability benefits and the nature and extent of the medical evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1220.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as the EEOC states (although in the context of SSA standards for disability), two significant policy goals "support the conclusion that representations made in application for disability benefits should never be an absolute bar to [an ADA claim]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 23. Those goals are: (1) eradicating discrimination against individuals with disabilities; and (2) not forcing individuals to choose between applying for disability benefits and vindicating their rights under the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Some potential plaintiffs [who believe their employers committed disability discrimination] might abandon their rights under the ADA if they could not apply for disability benefits. Faced with the financial pressures accompanying the loss of a job and the uncertainty and length of litigation, individuals might well elect immediate benefits over the pursuit of even the most meritorious ADA claim. Such a situation would not only harm the individuals the ADA seeks to protect, it would also protect the very activity the ADA seeks to eliminate: discrimination against disabled individuals. Employers who discriminate unlawfully would be shielded from liability if their victims could sue them only if they did not file for disability benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 141 F.3d at 1368 (footnote omitted). Thus, the court declined to apply judicial estoppel to bar, as a matter of law, an ADA claim made by an individual who received SSA disability benefits. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This trend of the circuit courts to decline to apply judicial estoppel in situations such as this is reflected in several other recent decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Haschmann,</span> 151 F.3d at 603 (judicial estoppel does not apply to foreclose ADA claims when the claimant has applied for SSA disability benefits; "[n]evertheless, the receipt of a Social Security benefit, while not dispositive, may be relevant to the issue whether a plaintiff under the ADA is a qualified individual with a disability"); <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 141 F.3d at 1367 (because of the different definitions of disability under various private disability policies and because the Social Security Act does not take into account an individual's ability to work with accommodation, "neither application for nor receipt of disability benefits automatically bars a claimant from establishing that she is a qualified person with a disability under the ADA"); <span class="Italic">Rascon v. U.S. West Communications, Inc.</span>, 143 F.3d 1324, 1332 (10th Cir. 1998) ("join[ing] the majority of circuits and hold[ing] that statements made in connection with an application for social security disability benefits cannot be an automatic bar to a disability discrimination claim under the ADA"); <span class="Italic">Griffith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</span> 135 F.3d 376, 380-83 (6th Cir. 1998) (judicial estoppel does not preclude an ADA claim based on receipt of SSA disability benefits); <span class="Italic">Weigel v.</span> <span class="Italic">Target Stores,</span> 122 F.3d 461, 468-69 (7th Cir. 1997) (an SSA total disability determination was relevant to, but not dispositive of, the issue of the plaintiffs status as a qualified person with a disability for ADA purposes); <span class="Italic">Eback v. Chater,</span> 94 F.3d 410, 412 (8th Cir. 1996) (ADA definition of qualified individual with a disability requires consideration of reasonable accommodation whereas SSA's assessment of availability of jobs for a claimant is based on a range of jobs with no consideration of the employer's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation); <span class="Italic">Overton</span>, 977 F.2d at 1196 (a person can have a disability for SSA purposes and still be a "qualified individual with a disability" for Rehabilitation Act purposes because SSA "may determine that a claimant is unlikely to find a job, but that does not mean that there is no work the claimant can do").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp.,</span> 120 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">cert. granted</span>, __U.S.__, 119 S. Ct. 39, 142 L. Ed.2d 30 (1998), the court held that the application for or the receipt of social security disability benefits creates a rebuttable presumption that the claimant or recipient of such benefits is judicially estopped from asserting that he is a 'qualified individual with a disability' for purposes of an ADA claim. However, the Supreme Court has granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> on two issues arising from this case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;whether the application for, or receipt of, disability insurance benefits under the SSA creates a rebuttable presumption that the applicant or recipient is judicially estopped from asserting that she is a qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If it does not create such a presumption, what weight, if any, should be given to the application for, or receipt of, disability insurance benefits when a person asserts that she is a "qualified individual with a disability" under the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the considerations discussed above, and in accord with the trend in recent decisions from the majority of circuit courts of appeal, we decline to erect an absolute procedural bar via judicial estoppel to prevent a recipient of CSRS or FERS disability benefits from claiming disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Rather, the Board will employ a case-by-case approach in determining the effect of an appellant's application for or receipt of a disability retirement award upon a claim of disability discrimination. That approach will entail a consideration of the relevant factors which the EEOC advises a fact-finder to examine when determining whether a disability benefits award is inconsistent with a subsequent ADA claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, although this list is not exhaustive, the EEOC advises that the fact-finder should consider: (1) The manner in which disability is defined on a disability benefits application; (2) the manner in which the disability benefits application permits the applicant to describe his condition (i.e., in writing and in a narrative format or by merely checking boxes, or verbally over the telephone); (3) the applicant's representations versus relevant documents including disability reports, and doctors' reports regarding his medical condition; (4) the circumstances under which the application for disability benefits was made, including whether the applicant was denied reasonable accommodation, or applied for benefits at the employer's insistence, or on a doctor's advice; and (5) the applicant's health condition at the time of his application for disability benefits versus his condition at the time of the alleged disability discrimination. Enforcement Guidance at 9-10, 21-23; <span class="Italic">see also Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 88, 91-92 (1998) (where the appellant had been awarded a disability retirement benefit and made numerous statements during the course of the Board proceedings that he could not work as of the time of his separation, the Board lacked jurisdiction over the alleged involuntary retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, on remand the administrative judge shall employ this approach to determine the effect, if any, of the appellant's receipt of disability retirement on her claim that the agency's removal, action constituted disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. The administrative judge shall allow the parties an opportunity to submit argument and evidence on this issue.</p>
