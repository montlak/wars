<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-205"><span class="space">c.</span> Initial Decision Controls Basis for Fee Determination</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee awards depend on factual findings concerning the merits of the appeal and the basis for the initiation of the action appealed. The AJ who analyzes a fee petition should do so from the vantage point of the AJ who issued the decision on the merits of the action appealed. If both portions of the case are decided by the same AJ, the factual analysis that controls the disposition of the fee motion should not change from the initial decision on the merits to the initial decision on the fee petition. <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 187, 191, 194-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 16 (1998) ("The findings from the initial decision on the merits when that decision became the final decision of the Board, not re-review of the full record developed below, control in determining whether an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice."), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 198, 203 &#x00B6; 3 (2000); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 29 MSPR 584, 587 (1986) ("In denying that motion [for fees] she [the AJ] characterized the evidence and her findings in a manner somewhat more favorable to the agency than she had done in the original decision on the merits of the removal"); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ who decided the merits is not the AJ deciding the fee application, the AJ who reviews the fee application must defer to the factual findings on the merits of the case that were issued by the first AJ. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. MSPB</span>, 746 F.2d 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Capeless v. VA</span>, 78 MSPR 619, 622 (1998) (applying <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>: "[A] substitute AJ for the attorney fees case should evaluate the appellant's motion for attorneys fees from the view of the original AJ"; "[t]he addendum initial decision on attorney fees should reflect the insights and reasoning of the AJ who heard the case[.] ").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board allows itself room to correct jurisdictional errors of initial decisions that have become final through the passage of time and that then form the basis for fee petitions. In <span class="Italic">Bradshaw v. OPM,</span> DC-831E-10-0811-A-1 (NP 3/30/2012), the appellant filed a fee petition as a prevailing party based on what appeared to be a settlement of a disability annuity appeal. The AJ who received the fee petition determined that he made a mistake by referring to a settlement when, in fact, OPM had granted the annuity before the issuance of an initial decision, precluding the appellant from assuming prevailing party status. On PFR the appellant argued that the AJ should not have recharacterized the initial decision dismissing the appeal based on a settlement. The Board, referring to the proposition that jurisdiction is always at issue, disagreed, resolving that it could determine the true basis of the disposition of the appeal, i.e., mooted by OPM's action, and then conclude that the Board lost jurisdiction over the appeal and lacked jurisdiction over a counsel fee petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Board has the authority to require a Federal agency to pay reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee if the employee is the prevailing party and the Board determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice. The Board has held, consistent with <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001) that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A] party may be considered to have prevailed under a fee-shifting statute that requires prevailing party status only if the party obtained an "enforceable judgment[&#8197;]" resulting in a "'material alteration of the legal relationship'" between the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">McKenna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 6 (2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604); <span class="Italic">see also Sacco v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 225, &#x00B6; 7 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 317 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003). An appellant who shows that he obtained a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties through an enforceable final judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement entered into the record for the purposes of enforcement by the Board is a "prevailing party" for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">Del Prete v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6; 6 (2007), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662 (2011); <span class="Italic">McKenna</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Griffith v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 251, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeal for which the appellant sought an award of attorney fees involved the denial of the appellant's application for disability retirement by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM received the appellant's application for disability retirement on February 27, 2009, and issued an initial decision denying the appellant's application on January 25, 2010. The appellant requested reconsideration of the initial decision, and, on July 19, 2010, OPM issued a reconsideration decision affirming its denial of the appellant's application. The appellant subsequently filed an appeal of OPM's decision with the Board. Because the appellant withdrew his request for a hearing, the administrative judge set January 19, 2011, as the date on which the evidentiary record would close. On January 25, 2011, after the record closed, but before the administrative judge issued an initial decision addressing the merits of the appellant's appeal, OPM filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it was rescinding its reconsideration decision and granting the appellant's application for disability retirement. On February 3, 2011, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal. The initial decision indicated that the parties had reached a settlement and had provided the Board with a copy of a written agreement for inclusion in the Board's record. The decision further indicated that the administrative judge determined that the settlement agreement was lawful on its face, that the parties understood its terms and had freely entered into it, and that the administrative judge was accepting the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. The actual record, however, contained no written settlement agreement. Nevertheless, neither party filed a petition for review of the initial decision, and it therefore became the Board's final order on March 10, 2011, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(a) (the initial decision of the judge will become final 35 days after issuance unless any party files a petition for review or the Board reopens the case on its own motion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 9, 2011, the appellant filed a motion for an award of attorney fees, arguing that he was a prevailing party on the basis of his having obtained enforceable relief against OPM by virtue of the settlement agreement and the administrative judge's acceptance of the agreement into the record of the appeal for enforcement purposes. He also argued that an award of attorney fees was warranted in the interest of justice because OPM knew or should have known at the time that it made its decision that it would not prevail on appeal, or, alternatively, because OPM's decision was clearly without merit. OPM filed a response to the appeal in which it argued that the appellant was not a prevailing party because it had unilaterally rescinded its action prior to the Board issuing any findings on the merits of his appeal. The appellant filed a reply to OPM's response in which he argued that the parties entered into a settlement agreement when "OPM filed a motion to dismiss the matter in light of OPM's promise to give Appellant his retirement benefits [and] Appellant did not oppose the motion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 7, 2011, the administrative judge issued an addendum decision denying the appellant's motion for an award of attorney fees. In the decision, the administrative judge indicated that the underlying decision "erroneously gave as the reason for dismissal 'settlement' instead of the correct reason, which was lack of Board jurisdiction owing to the agency's rescission of its reconsideration decision." Accordingly, the administrative judge determined that the appellant did not obtain an enforceable order, judgment, or decree against the agency and, therefore, was not a prevailing party. In the alternative, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish that an award of attorney fees was warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review of that decision, arguing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that it was error for the administrative judge to attempt to revise the findings in the merits decision to conclude that the appellant did not qualify as a prevailing party for the purpose of denying his motion for <span id="Page_4734"></span>attorney fees. OPM did not file a response to the appellant's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general matter, when adjudicating a motion for attorney fees, it is inappropriate for an administrative judge to recharacterize the evidence and the conclusions reached in rendering the decision on the merits of the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1458-59 (Fed. Cir. 1984). However, an exception to this general rule exists with respect to matters implicating the Board's jurisdiction, which, by extension, implicates the Board's authority to award attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Joyce v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 19 (1999) (a substantive jurisdictional finding is required in order for the Board to award attorney fees), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Sacco v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 37 (2001). It is well settled that the issue of Board jurisdiction may be raised at any time during a proceeding, <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 477, 478 (1985), and this rule extends even to an addendum proceeding such as an attorney fees proceeding, <span class="Italic">Sobol v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 611, 613-14 (1995). Accordingly, despite the appellant's argument to the contrary, the administrative judge properly considered the issue of the Board's jurisdiction when considering whether the Board had the authority to award the appellant attorney fees in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the administrative judge properly concluded that the underlying appeal should have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. While the appellant argues that OPM rescinded its reconsideration decision as a result of a settlement agreement reached between the parties, the appellant has failed to present evidence sufficient to establish such an agreement. As set forth above, the record does not include a copy of any written settlement agreement executed by the parties to this appeal, and the appellant does not assert that the parties executed a written agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also fails to establish that the parties entered into an oral agreement. Although oral settlement agreements are enforceable, an administrative judge should ensure that the terms of an oral agreement are memorialized in the record. <span class="Italic">See Parks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). Furthermore, absent a formal withdrawal of an appeal, and until the parties have agreed on the specific terms of the settlement agreement, the act of finality constituting a settlement has not occurred. <span class="Italic">See Futrell-Rawls v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). In this case, the administrative judge did not memorialize the terms of any oral agreement between the parties in the record, and the record does not indicate that the appellant formally withdrew her appeal. In addition, the appellant has failed to establish that the parties actually agreed to specific settlement terms. In fact, in his petition for review, the appellant does not argue that the parties negotiated specific terms to resolve the appeal. Instead, the appellant merely argues that he formed his belief as to the existence of an enforceable agreement between the parties "[b]ased on the Agency's representation that it promised to grant Appellant disability retirement benefits, and based upon the AJ's characterization of these representations as a settlement." Nevertheless, settlement agreements are contracts, <span class="Italic">see Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (a settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a matter of law), and despite what one party might believe as to the existence of a contract, one party's unilateral promise to provide a benefit to another party does not create a contract. Rather, mutual consideration must flow between the parties in order to form an enforceable contract. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Black v. Department of Transportation</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 18 (2011); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 545, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Social Security Administration</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). The appellant has cited no evidence that would support the proposition that OPM received consideration from the appellant in exchange for its promise to grant the appellant disability retirement benefits. Accordingly, despite the fact that the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing this appeal as settled, the record does not support the conclusion that an act of finality constituting a settlement actually occurred. Instead, we find that the record supports the conclusion that, upon receiving evidence sufficient to convince it that the appellant met the eligibility requirements for disability retirement, OPM unilaterally rescinded its reconsideration decision before the administrative judge issued a decision addressing the merits of the appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge belatedly recognized when adjudicating the appellant's motion for attorney fees, the Board has determined that the proper disposition of an appeal in which OPM unilaterally rescinds its retirement decision while the appeal is being processed is dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 549, &#x00B6; 4 (2010). As discussed previously, the Board has also determined that the issue of jurisdiction may be considered in an addendum proceeding, such as a proceeding involving a motion for attorney fees, and we therefore conclude that the administrative judge appropriately considered the issue and correctly determined that the proper disposition of the underlying appeal should have been a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. Still, the Board's administrative judges lack the authority to reopen a final decision to correct an erroneous conclusion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.112 (defining the limited authority administrative judges retain with respect to a case for which they have issued an initial decision). The Board, however, has the authority to reopen an appeal and reconsider a decision of a judge on its own motion at any time. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118. We find it appropriate to exercise that authority with respect to the initial decision in this appeal. Accordingly, we REOPEN the underlying initial decision in this case, VACATE that decision, and DISMISS the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on OPM's rescission of its reconsideration decision prior to the issuance of the initial decision. Furthermore, because the Board is authorized to award attorney fees only in those cases in which the appellant achieves prevailing party status by being awarded some relief by the Board or by obtaining an enforceable settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Mulero-Echevarria v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>), we conclude that the administrative judge correctly concluded that, in the absence of an enforceable settlement agreement resolving this appeal, the appellant is not entitled to an award of attorney fees.</p>
