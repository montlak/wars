<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-116"><span class="space">7.</span> Time in Court</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier we considered the complexities involved in fee petitions presented to the courts under the Equal Access to Justice Act for time spent in court. The Back Pay Act also provides authority to recover fees for time in court, but the fee petition must be directed to the court, not to the Board. The Reform Act, 5 USC 7701(g), only permits the Board to award fees for time before the Board. The allocation of exclusive authority to a court to award fees for time in court was determined by <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 924 F.2d 1577, 1579-81 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues as a threshold matter that the board did not have jurisdiction to award or enhance attorney fees for the services of Phillips' attorney in this court. A jurisdictional matter can be raised at any stage of a judicial proceeding by any party or by the court on its own motion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites</span>, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982); <span class="Italic">United States v. Sherwood</span>, 312 U.S. 584 (1941); <span class="Italic">Zumerling v. Marsh</span>, 783 F.2d 1032, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We can, and do, question the board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the board has no authority under 5 USC 7701(g) to award attorney fees for services rendered by an attorney in this court in connection with judicial review of a board decision. <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Department of Commerce</span>, 735 F.2d 558, 560-61 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 818 F.2d 838, 840 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Olsen</span> the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 205 of the Reform Act, 5 USC 7701, deals with appeals from an agency to the Board. The Board's authority under subsection (g)(1) to award attorney's fees necessarily relates to fees incurred in those administrative proceedings. Judicial review of Board decisions is governed by section 7703, which contains no provision authorizing the award of attorney's fees incurred in the judicial proceedings. <span class="Italic">The Board has no authority to award attorney's fees for <span id="Page_4648"></span>services rendered in connection with judicial review of a Board decision.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">735 F.2d at 560-61 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in <span class="Italic">Covington</span> argued that the employee was required to seek attorney fees from the board for the services of his attorney before this court. This argument was rejected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Nor is Mr. Covington required to seek from the Board his fees and expenses incurred before this court, as the agency argues. The "Board has no authority to award attorney's fees for services rendered in connection with judicial review," established at least since <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, 735 F.2d 558, 561 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">818 F.2d at 840.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These decisions make clear that the board's action in this case, to the extent it was based on section 7701(g), must be vacated for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the Back Pay Act, Phillips argues that this court has never squarely been faced with the question of whether the board may award attorney fees under the Back Pay Act for services provided during judicial review of a case. Section 5596 provides that attorney fees may be awarded when a personnel action against an employee is determined to be unjustified or unwarranted; it is silent, however, as to whether the board or the court may grant such fees for services in this court. Phillips points to 5 CFR 550.807, the regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management under the Back Pay Act, as authorizing the board to make the initial determination of an attorney fee award under the Back Pay Act for services connected with a judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court rejected Phillips' contention in <span class="Italic">Olsen</span>. In that case, the government similarly argued that the regulations...require that an application for attorneys fees must first be presented to the board. The court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In our view, the regulations the government cites cover the award of attorney's fees to a party who prevailed before the Board for services there provided. It does not limit our authority to award fees for such services to a party who prevailed before us after losing before the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's <span class="Italic">in banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> reinforces the position of the <span class="Italic">Olsen</span> court by saying that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Federal Circuit Rule 20 [now Rule 47.9] contemplates that when attorney fees and expenses are authorized in connection with an appeal, the amount of the award for such fees and expenses shall be determined by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Federal Circuit is in a better position than the board to determine the amount of fees and expenses to be awarded in connection with the appeal to this court, although the board should determine the amount of fees to be awarded in connection with the board proceedings....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that to interpret the Back Pay Act as Phillips contends would be to invite multiple requests for the same services before this court--a request under the Back Pay Act would go to the MSPB, whereas we have consistently held that an EAJA application is to be filed with this court....&#8197;It is most unlikely, in our view, that Congress intended a bifurcated filing process. We conclude that a request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act for services rendered in judicial proceedings must, as in the case of an EAJA request, be directed to this court....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this court may award attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, we cannot do so indirectly by reviewing a board determination it had no authority to make. As we said in <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985), "[i]f the MSPB does not have jurisdiction, then neither do we, except to the extent that we always have inherent power to determine our own jurisdiction and that of the board." We, therefore, vacate the board's decision insofar as it awarded attorney fees and denied enhancement for the services of Phillips' attorney in this court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rationale of <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> was reaffirmed, although the procedure followed in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> and predecessor cases was not ringingly reaffirmed, in <span class="Italic">Ramos v. DOJ</span>, 552 F.3d 1356, 1358-62 (Fed. Cir. 2009), allowing an exception to a court rule governing the timing of submission of fee petitions to the court to permit the court's consideration of a fee petition resulting from an appeal remanded to the Board from the court and resulting in a favorable result on remand:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge assigned to the case ordered Mr. Ramos reinstated, retroactive to the effective date of his removal. That decision was affirmed by the full Board. Mr. Ramos then filed a motion with the Board requesting attorney fees for the entire appeal process that had ultimately led to his being reinstated. When determining whether the "in the interest of justice" standard was met, and thus whether awarding attorney fees under the Back Pay Act would be warranted, the administrative judge stated, "I find that the agency committed gross procedural error in terminating the appellant without affording him the procedural protections of a tenured federal employee." The administrative judge then concluded that "attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice" and entered an order granting fees for the legal work performed before the Board. With respect to the attorneys' work before this court during the interim appeal, however, the administrative judge concluded that "the appellant's request for attorney fees for work his attorneys performed before the court must be directed to the court." That conclusion was based on this court's statement in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. General Services Administration</span> that "a request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act for services rendered in judicial proceedings must, as in the case of an [Equal Access to Justice Act] request, be directed to this court." 924 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ramos believed that he was barred from filing a motion requesting attorney fees from this court by this court's Rule 47.7, which states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An application for an award of attorney fees and expenses must be served and filed within the time prescribed by the statute authorizing the award. <span class="Italic">If the statute does not prescribe a time, the application must be made within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order denying rehearing, whichever is later</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fed. Cir. Rule 47.7(a)(2) (emphasis added). The default venue for obtaining relief from the government, the Court of Federal Claims, has been closed to parties in Mr. Ramos's situation since Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 455 (1988). Mr. Ramos therefore appealed the Board's order denying him attorney fees for work performed during his interim appeal to this court, arguing that the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulation grant the Board the authority to award such fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ramos argues that the Board should have entered an award for the attorney fees attributable to the interim appeal to this court. Relying on <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, the government responds that the Board is not authorized under the Back Pay Act to enter an award for work done in this court. We agree that this court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> prohibits the Board from making such an award and that the Board was therefore correct to hold that it lacked authority to grant fees for the work done before this court on the interim appeal in Mr. Ramos's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ramos contends that <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> is distinguishable and therefore not controlling here, because in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> this court was the authority that directed the correction of an unlawful personnel action, whereas in this case this court merely remanded to the Board, which then became the authority that directed the corrective action. Mr. Ramos proposes that <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> be interpreted as limited to cases in which this court directs the correction of the unlawful personnel action, and that in cases in which this court's action constitutes merely an interim appeal, as in this case, the Board should not be barred from entering a fee award for work done in this court in the course of the interim appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Mr. Ramos is correct in describing the factual difference between this case and <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, that difference does not justify a difference in outcome. The problem is that according weight to the distinction Mr. Ramos proposes would be inconsistent with the analysis in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> itself and in earlier decisions of this court. In <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, this court characterized the issue before it broadly, as presenting "the question of whether the board may award attorney fees under the Back Pay Act for services provided during judicial review of a case." 924 F.2d at 1580. The court concluded that the board may not award fees under the Back Pay Act; it did not limit its ruling to cases in which the court directed the correction of the unlawful personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the rationale underlying the decision in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> is broader than Mr. Ramos suggests. First, the court in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> relied on a prior opinion, <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Department of Commerce</span>, 735 F.2d 558, 562-63 (Fed. Cir. 1984), for the proposition that this court has authority to grant attorney fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 924 F.2d at 1580-81. The <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> court also relied on our prior <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 808 F.2d 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), as a source for the general principles that (1) the Federal Circuit is in the best position to determine the proper amount of fees for work before this court, and (2) this court's rules contemplate that "when attorney fees and expenses are authorized in connection with an appeal, the amount of the award for such fees and expenses shall be determined by this court." <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 924 F.2d at 1581. Both considerations are as applicable to attorney fee requests under the Back Pay Act as <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> found them to be under the Equal Access to Justice Act ("EAJA"), 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2414.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> court rested its conclusion--that attorney fee requests for work completed before this court must be directed to this court under the Back Pay Act--on the recognition that an unfortunate result would follow from a contrary rule; that is, a "bifurcated process" would be created, by which fee requests under EAJA would come to this court, while fee requests for the same work under the Back Pay Act would go to the Board. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 924 F.2d at 1581. There is little doubt that Congress intended to avoid a bifurcated process for fee applications and <span id="Page_4649"></span>instead intended for fee applications under the fee-shifting statutes to be handled in a streamlined, simple manner. As the Supreme Court has noted, "[a] request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major litigation." <span class="Italic">Comm'r, INS v. Jean,</span> 496 U.S. 154, 163 (1990). Instead, the fee-shifting statutes "favor[&#8197;] treating a case as an inclusive whole." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 161-62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> court noted, after this court's <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> a prevailing party-employee may seek attorney fees for work before this court under both the Back Pay Act and EAJA. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 924 F.2d at 1581. <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> also mandated that the prevailing party-employee direct any EAJA requests for work on appeal to this court. <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, 808 F.2d at 1468; <span class="Italic">see Phillips</span>, 924 F.2d at 1581. Thus, if we were to permit the Board to grant attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, a prevailing party-employee could direct a Back Pay Act request to the Board and an EAJA request to this court, both for the same work. The <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> court concluded that it is "most unlikely" that Congress intended such a bifurcated filing process, and that, accordingly, "a request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act for services rendered in judicial proceedings must, as in the case of an EAJA request, be directed to this court." 524 F.2d at 1581.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, based on our decision in <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, bifurcated attorney fee requests are permitted in the sense that a Back Pay Act request for work before the Board may be directed to the Board while an EAJA request for work on appeal will be directed to this court in the same case. In fact, that is exactly the outcome in <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> itself, and since then has regularly resulted in separate attorney fee requests being directed to the several tribunals that became involved in adjudicating a claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Doty v. United States</span>, 71 F.3d 384, 387 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Doty filed an itemized and documented request for...attorney fees and expenses for the appeal to this court, stating that he has filed a petition for the balance of his fees and expenses with the Court of Federal Claims."). Critically, however, the separate attorney fee requests are not related to the same underlying work by the party's attorneys. The problem of bifurcated attorney fee proceedings for the same work is not peculiar to cases in which an attorney fee application is based on this court's having directed the correction of unlawful action, as in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>. It is also created when this court's involvement occurs during an interim appeal, as here. The rationale of <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> therefore applies to a case such as this one, just as it did to <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If we were writing on a blank slate, it might make sense for attorney fee applications for work done on appeal from Board decisions to be authorized only by the Back Pay Act (and not also by EAJA) and to be filed in the first instance before the Board. For example, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Standard Oil Co.</span>, 399 U.S. 222 (1970), held that under the Clayton Act district courts can award fees for both trial and appellate work. Under such a regime, the Board would address all fee applications for employee proceedings, including both the portion of the proceedings before the Board and the portion of the proceedings, if any, on interim or final appeal before this court. We do not, however, write on a blank slate, and to follow that course we would have to overrule not only <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, but also a number of other prior decisions of this court, including <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, a decision of the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 818 F.2d 838 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Am. Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 814 F.2d 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 808 F.2d 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Austin v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 742 F.2d 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 735 F.2d 558 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Such a course might recommend itself if the result of continuing to follow the above-cited line of this court's cases were to deprive a litigant of the right to request fees that Congress clearly intended that the litigant be entitled to seek. In fact, however, the dispute in this case does not affect whether an attorney fee award can be sought and obtained, but only which entity--the Board or the court--will decide the litigant's entitlement to the fee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ramos raises one concern, however, that is presented by applying our prior decisions in the factual setting of this case. He points out that under the rules of this court, he might be deemed to be foreclosed from seeking fees from this court in an action such as this one. The problem is this: Rule 47.7 of the Federal Circuit Rules provides that an application for an award of attorney fees and expenses must be served and filed within the period of time prescribed by the statute authorizing the award, and if there is no such time limit, within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order denying rehearing. Fed. Cir. R. 47.7(a)(2). In contrast to EAJA,[1] under the Back Pay Act there can be no entitlement for fees based on an interim court decision remanding the matter to the agency. Under the Back Pay Act, the possible entitlement for fees arises only after a "correction of the personnel action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A). A fee application thus cannot be made within 30 days of the court of appeals' judgment if the court has remanded to the agency. Under these circumstances, we construe Rule 47.7 of the rules of this court as requiring an application for fees to this court within 30 days after the Board decision creating the possible fee entitlement. In this case, that 30-day window has long passed. However, we think that given the uncertainty as to the proper venue for seeking appellate fees before today's decision (and the fact that Mr. Ramos timely filed a fee application with the Board), it is appropriate to waive the requirement of Rule 47.7 in this case and permit Mr. Ramos 20 days to pursue a fee application before this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Gurley v. Peake</span>, 528 F.3d 1322, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Nicholson</span>, 463 F.3d 1349, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Former Employees of Motorola Ceramic Prods. v. United States</span>, 336 F.3d 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ramos urges us to grant the fee award based on the application that was filed with the Board. The government responds that the application, among other things, requests an unreasonably large fee. The parties' debate over the amount of the fee request, however, is limited to an exchange in the last few pages of each party's brief. That exchange is far too cryptic to enable us to make an intelligent assessment of the reasonableness of the fee request. Accordingly, we believe the appropriate course is not to treat the application that was filed with the Board as if it were a separate application for fees on appeal filed with us, but instead to direct the appellant to file a separate application for fees in this court. In that application, Mr. Ramos can set forth his justification for the fee request. If it chooses, the government can then set forth in full its grounds for opposing the fee request or seeking a modification of the amount requested, and Mr. Ramos will have an opportunity to respond to the points raised in the government's opposition. If Mr. Ramos chooses to pursue fees for the work involved in obtaining a fee award, including work related to this appeal, he should include such a request in his application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, Mr. Ramos is granted 20 days within which to submit an attorney fee request under the Back Pay Act for work related to our decision in <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 240 Fed. Appx. 409 (Fed. Cir. 2005), as well as work involved in obtaining a fee award. The time limitation of Fed. Cir. R. 47.7 is waived for purposes of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 924 F.2d 1039, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (summarizing cases: "[i]t is clear from these decisions that the board did not have authority to award attorney fees to Grubka for the services of his attorney in this court in the judicial review of the board's decision.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit declined to alter the course in a USERRA case, again deciding that the Board lacked the authority to award fees for time spent in Federal Circuit appeals, <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 759 F.3d 1341, 1344-45 (Fed. Cir. 2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson's first argument is that the Merit Systems Protection Board has statutory authority to make a comprehensive fee award under USERRA, which would also fees for work done before this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute on which Mr. Erickson relies, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4), authorizes the Board, in its discretion, to award attorney fees to a successful USERRA claimant. Although the statutory language does not expressly rule out a fee award for work done before a reviewing court, the focus of the statute is on work done before the Board. Thus, the statute provides that a fee award is authorized only if "the Board determines as a result of a hearing or adjudication conducted pursuant to a complaint submitted by a person directly to the Board...that such person is entitled to an order" requiring compliance or compensation. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Interpreting the USERRA fee statute as not giving the Board authority to grant fee applications for work done before this court is consistent with a longstanding line of cases in which this court has held that the Board is not authorized to grant an award of fees for work done on appeal from a Board order. <span class="Italic">See Gallo v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 725 F.3d 1306, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("[T]his court is the appropriate forum in which to request attorney fees incurred in proceedings before this court."); <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 552 F.3d 1356, 1359-60 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the Board is not authorized under the Back Pay Act to enter an award for work done before the court of appeals); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 924 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (same); <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs</span>., 818 F.2d 838, 840 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (the Board lacks authority to award attorney fees for services rendered in connection with judicial review); <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 808 F.2d 1456, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (EAJA request for work done on appeal must be directed to the court of appeals).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson argues that the cited cases do not speak to attorney fees under USERRA and that this court is therefore free to depart from its precedent interpreting the fee provisions of other statutory schemes. The reasoning of those cited cases, however, did not depend on the details of the particular statutory schemes. Mr. Erickson does not provide a convincing argument as to why USERRA is different. Instead, he states only that a rule that forbids the Board from awarding fees for judicial review "would conflict with a plain reading of [USERRA], which authorizes 'the Board' to award fees" and would "unduly restrict the broad equitable powers afforded a court to vindicate veterans rights, and the liberal construction given to USERRA for the benefit of those who...left private life to serve their country."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such broad policy generalizations cannot make up for the absence of statutory authority or override the applicable case law. While statutory <span id="Page_4650"></span>language unambiguously granting the Board authority to award fees for work done on appeal would, of course, trump prior precedents to the contrary, there is no such unambiguous language in the USERRA fee statute. In fact, as noted, the language of the statute suggests the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The absence of clear statutory authority to award fees for work on appeal is particularly telling in light of the fact that such a statutory authorization for a fee award against the government would constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club</span>, 463 U.S. 680, 685 (1983) ("Except to the extent it has waived its immunity, the Government is immune from claims for attorney's fees."). A waiver of sovereign immunity "must be 'unequivocally expressed' in statutory text," and "[a]ny ambiguities in the statutory language are to be construed in favor of immunity." <span class="Italic">FAA v. Cooper</span>, 132 S. Ct. 1441, 1448 (2012). Ambiguity exists "if there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would not authorize money damages against the government." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is far from clear that section 4324(c)(4) authorizes the Board to award attorney fees for work done in the course of judicial review of Board decisions. We therefore follow our prior precedents in analogous contexts and hold that the Board lacks statutory authority to grant an award for fees incurred in Mr. Erickson's appeals to this court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Erickson</span> considered immaterial to the court's authority to award fees for court time the statutory authority for the Board to award counsel fees in USERRA cases, 759 F.3d at 1345:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson next argues that if the Board lacks authority under USERRA to grant his fee request, this court should grant the award pursuant to USERRA because USERRA is to be construed liberally and because "veterans' statutes are to be resolved" in favor of veterans. Mr. Erickson admits that his "interpretation arguably conflicts with a purely literal reading of [38 U.S.C.] section 4324(c)(4)'s language that 'the Board' is authorized to award fees." He argues, however, that it would be "untenable" for the court to interpret the statute in such a way that provides "no avenue for a veteran to recover legal fees at the appellate level."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with Mr. Erickson's argument is that this court is not authorized to award attorney fees when it lacks statutory authorization to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. Cir. R. 47.7; <span class="Italic">Gallo v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 725 F.3d 1306, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("Under Rule 47.7, this court must itself be authorized by law to award attorney fees."). Furthermore, "this court does not derive its authority to award attorney fees from the Board's authority to do so." <span class="Italic">Gallo</span>, 725 F.3d at 1309; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 1308-09 ("[M]erely because this court is authorized to review a tribunal that is statutorily authorized to award attorney fees, does not mean that this court itself is authorized by that same statute to award attorney fees in the first instance....&#8197;For example, the Board in certain circumstances may award attorney fees for work before it when attorney fees are not available under the same statute for work done before this court."). Instead, there must be an independent statutory authorization for the court to award fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1309. Because no such independent statutory authorization exists under USERRA, the court cannot award attorney fees under USERRA in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It occurred in <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, 866 F.3d 1375, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2017), that the court, without mention of its precedent, while remanding an appeal (and counsel fee petition) to the Board, directed the Board to consider in the remand compensation for the time of appellant's counsel in the Federal Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[3]&#x2003;To the extent that Ms. Rumsey is ultimately successful in her claim for attorney's fees for Slavet's representation, the Board should award appropriate fees for the work of Robert Burka, Esq., in securing that award before the Board and in this court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, the Board held unto itself the authority to award fees for time spent in court, pursuant to the Back Pay Act. Other statutory schemes permit an administrative adjudicator to award fees for time spent in court on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blackburn v. Reich</span>, 79 F.3d 1375, 1379 (4th Cir. 1996) (whistleblower provisions of the Energy Reorganization Act, 42 USC 5851(b)(2)(B): "The Secretary has not pointed us to any statutory scheme wherein attorney's fees are recoverable for some, but less than all, the litigation expenses in a single action."). Nonetheless, <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> now governs Reform Act fee awards. The history leading to <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> is traced below.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the Federal Circuit's decisions barring the Board from awarding counsel fees for time in court, in a somewhat summary fashion, the Board awarded fees for court time spent opposing review sought by the Office of Personnel Management. <span class="Italic">Antal v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 27, 28 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Scarborough v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 140, 140 (1984) (suggesting that appellant's counsel file a fee motion for time spent in court if the parties could not settle on an appropriate fee). Then coverage of court time was explored in detail in <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 611 (1985), <span class="Italic">reopening</span> <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 184, 185 (1985). The petitioner lost before the Board, then won in court and followed his judicial victory with a fee petition to the Board that included time spent in the court appeal. The Board decided it had the authority to award the fees requested. <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, 27 MSPR at 613-16. <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> was followed by the Board. <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 106, 112 (1987); <span class="Italic">Mitchum v. TVA</span>, 29 MSPR 682, 685 (1986). In <span class="Italic">SSA v. Balaban</span>, 33 MSPR 309, 317-18 n.6 (1987), the Board distinguished its authority to grant fees under 5 USC 5596 and 5 USC 7701(g).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The time-in-court compensation formula took an odd turn in retirement cases involving MSPB rather than OPM as a respondent. The Board determined in <span class="Italic">D'Onofrio v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 433, 438 (1987), that the Board was liable, as respondent in the court case, for fees incurred during the judicial review proceedings. The Board reaffirmed that it had the authority to award fees for time spent in the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Metz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 34 MSPR 625, 628, 630-31 (1987). Chairman Levinson dissented in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I respectfully dissent from the majority decision insofar as it awards attorney fees under the Back Pay Act for work performed on an appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. As a practical matter, only that tribunal is situated to assess the reasonableness of requests for fees incurred in connection with judicial review. In addition, it seems to me that the majority opinion perpetuates Board precedent that is at odds with relevant guidance furnished by the Federal Circuit in a series of attorney fees cases decided under the Equal Access to Justice Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Chairman had his way, more or less, in the result reached in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 924 F.2d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">supra.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 78 MSPR 673, 674 (1998) (relying on <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> for the proposition that it is "well-settled that the Board lacks authority to award attorney fees incurred in connection with an appeal from the Board's decision to [the Federal Circuit]"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. DHS</span>, 109 MSPR 591, 2008 MSPB 199 (2008) (reaffirming that the Board does not award fees for time spent on a case by the appellant in the Federal Circuit). Whether the <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> result is good or bad, it is a result. Instead of having the Board decide all fee issues, including those arising from court litigation and Board litigation, the court decides issues arising in litigation before it, and the Board usually handles fees for time spent on the administrative litigation. In prior practice, a fee petition cross-filed with the court would be stayed pending adjudication of a similar fee petition before the Board. The cross-filed petition would ultimately be withdrawn if the Board's adjudication resolved the fee petition. Now each case brought and won in court may result in two adjudicated fee petitions. This result does not further judicial or administrative efficiency, but it protects the authority of both the Board and the court by allowing each to award fees incurred in their domains.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined it lacked authority to award counsel fees in an appeal of a whistleblower's case (resulting in a remand), in <span class="italic">Edenfield v. VA</span>, ___ Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Traditionally, "[u]nder the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the federal government...is immune to an award of money damages, except to the extent that the government has explicitly waived such immunity." <span class="Italic">M.A. Mortenson Co. v. United States</span>, 996 F.2d 1177, 1180 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (citation omitted). Such waivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the federal government. <span class="Italic">United States v. Nordic Vill. Inc</span>., 503 U.S. 30, 33-34 (1992). Allowing an award of attorney fees under the WPA is a waiver of sovereign immunity, and therefore the language of &#x00A7; 1221(g) must be strictly construed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, Federal Circuit Rule 47.7 limits this Court's ability to award attorney fees and reasonable expenses to situations where we are authorized by law to do so. In the absence of such statutory authorization, we lack the ability to award attorney fees. Indeed, "[u]nder Rule 47.7, this Court must <span class="Italic">itself</span> be authorized by law to award attorney fees." <span class="Italic">Gallo v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 725 F.3d 1306, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (emphasis added). This Court cannot "derive its authority to award attorney fees from the Board's authority to do so and must have its own statutory authorization to award attorney fees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1309.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Edenfield seeks an award of attorney fees only under &#x00A7; 1221(g), which outlines the types of correction action available to the Board in an individual right of action case under the WPA. It provides in relevant part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(g)(1)(A)&#x2003;If the Board orders corrective action under this section, such corrective action may include--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert witness fees, and costs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;Corrective action shall include attorney's fees and costs as provided for under paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If an employee...is the prevailing party before the Merit Systems Protection Board,...the agency involved shall be liable to the employee...for reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;If an employee...is the prevailing party in an appeal from the Merit Systems Protection Board, the agency involved shall be liable to the employee...for reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred, regardless of the basis of the decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4651"></span>This statute clearly lays out the conditions and procedure for awarding attorney fees in an individual right of action case under the WPA. First, &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A) explicitly gives <span class="Italic">the Board</span> the authority to "order corrective action." Next, &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(B) states that "corrective action shall include attorney's fees and costs" in the two scenarios provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3). Section 1221(g)(2) provides for an award of attorney fees in proceedings "<span class="Italic">before</span> the Merit Systems Protection Board," and &#x00A7; 1221(g)(3) provides for an award of attorney fees incurred "in an <span class="Italic">appeal from</span> the Merit Systems Protection Board." When tracking the language of this statute, two things are clear: first, the Board, and <span class="Italic">only</span> the Board, has the authority to order corrective action, including attorney fees; and second, the authority to award attorney fees extends to proceedings where an employee appeals a decision <span class="Italic">from</span> the Board to this Court, because this Court has jurisdiction over appeals of individual right of action decisions under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, no part of &#x00A7; 1221(g) grants <span class="Italic">this Court</span> the authority to award attorney fees in an action brought under the WPA. When construed narrowly as required by precedent, the plain language of &#x00A7; 1221(g) only allows <span class="Italic">the Board</span> to award attorney fees in appeals from the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Edenfield first argues that this Court is the proper forum to grant attorney fees because "[t]he Federal Circuit is in a better position than the [B]oard to determine the amount of fees and expenses to be awarded in connection with the appeal," quoting our decision in <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 808 F.2d 1456, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Mot. at 8-9. But in <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, the employee sought attorney fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). The EAJA is an entirely different statute that does, in fact, allow this Court to award attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1460-61 (quoting 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2412(b) (allowing an award of attorney fees and reasonable costs by "any court having jurisdiction [over such] action")). Unlike the EAJA, the WPA does not contain any language that would allow us to grant an award of attorney fees. Strictly construed, the statute <span class="Italic">only</span> allows the Board to grant an award of attorney fees, and that authority cannot be extended to this Court. <span class="Italic">Gallo</span>, 725 F.3d at 1309.</p>
