<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-168"><span class="space">j.</span> Jurisdictional Prerequisite: LCA Compliance or Breach</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant has the burden of proving jurisdiction over an appeal based on an action covered by a contract provision waiving appeal rights over that action--as with many last chance or abeyance agreements, <span class="Italic">Bernard v. VA</span>, CH-0752-13-0254-I-1 (NP 7/11/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In a traditional chapter 75 adverse action appeal, the agency bears the burden to show by preponderant evidence that the alleged misconduct occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 4 (2006). The Board lacks jurisdiction, however, to hear an appeal involving an action taken pursuant to an agreement in which the appellant waived his Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Interior</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 592, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). A different standard of proof applies in such cases. In order to demonstrate that the appellant's waiver of his appeal rights in an agreement was unenforceable, the appellant--not the agency--must show that: (1) he complied with the agreement; (2) the agency materially breached the agreement or acted in bad faith; (3) he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement; or (4) the agreement resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] (the appellant bears the burden of proving jurisdiction by preponderant evidence); <span class="Italic">see Gibson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 160 F.3d 722, 726 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (approving of the Board's articulation that an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that he did not breach the last chance agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant who challenges the implementation of an action taken as a result of an LCA may allege that the agency breached the agreement, or that the appellant did not breach the agreement, and the Board then determines, assuming the appellant's allegations are nonfrivolous, whether one party or the other breached the agreement. There is an implied condition of agency good faith in the implementation of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 564, 567, 568 (1997) ("Where an employee raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with a LCSA, the Board must resolve that issue <span class="Italic">before</span> addressing the scope and applicability of its waiver of appeal rights"; "The appellant at this stage of his appeal was not required to <span class="Italic">prove</span> the jurisdictional threshold issue of compliance with the LCSA, but need only nonfrivolously allege it."), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Meza v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 238, 241 (1997) (the AJ should have provided a jurisdictional hearing when the appellant disputed whether he used drugs in violation of a last chance agreement: "At this stage of the appeal...an appellant is not required to <span class="Italic">prove</span> the jurisdictional threshold issue of compliance with the LCSA, but need only nonfrivolously <span class="Italic">allege</span> it."); <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 76 MSPR 649, 654 (1997) (on the appellant's assertion that an LCA should not be enforced against her because she did not violate it, the "judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions but may not weigh the evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive"); <span class="Italic">Wells v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 497, 500 (1992) ("Because the record presents a legitimate factual issue of whether the appellant breached the terms of the settlement agreement, the administrative judge should conduct a hearing to decide whether the appellant breached the agreement, based on a consideration of all of the charges."), <span class="Italic">interpreting</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Conversely, Board jurisdiction is divested if the appellant's conduct breaches the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Link v.

Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">post.</span> If an individual is removed for failing to abide by a settlement agreement, a determination may be required as to whether the agreement was knowingly breached. The breach itself cannot control that determination, particularly if there is a claim of lack of mental capacity concerning the appellant's actions. <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3539).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988), affirmed a Board conclusion that an appellant could waive his right to a Board appeal through an LCA that was implemented in good faith by the agency. The appellant was removed in 1986. He appealed that removal and settled on the basis of an LCA stipulating his agreement that he "maintain satisfactory punctuality, attendance and good work habits that are acceptable to management" during a one-year period of probation and waive appeal rights and other complaint procedures during the year of probation as to any disciplinary action against him. The agreement concluded by stating that "this removal will be reissued with no rights of appeal to any forum if the employee fails to meet the terms set forth in this agreement." Months later the appellant was again removed for irregular attendance, and he again appealed to the Board. Based on the settlement agreement, the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Reviewing the Board's disposition of the case, the court declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There is nothing, McCall tells us, to prevent management from acting in bad faith, abusing its discretion, engaging in prohibited personnel practices or discrimination, or in any other way violating employees' substantive rights. We agree that the term "acceptable to management" does introduce an element of subjectivity into the agreement, but this does not mean that agencies would have a free hand to take arbitrary action against employees. We think it is implicit in the agreement here that the agency must abide by it in good faith. Thus, the agreement itself serves as a check on arbitrary agency action. If an agency acts in bad faith or takes other arbitrary and capricious action, as a breaching party it would not be able to enforce the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rogan v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3107) (interpreting <span class="Italic">McCall</span> to establish MSPB authority to review and enforce agency compliance with an LCA; removal sustained: "[T]he record contains the poor performance evaluations [the last chance agreement required a satisfactory appraisal], and the administrative judge's finding of good faith on the part of the agency.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board applied <span class="Italic">McCall</span> in <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 600, 603-04 (1989). An LCA contained a clause requiring the agency to act in "good faith." The appellant was removed after absences considered by the agency to be in excess of what the agreement allowed. Based on the record, the Board determined: the appellant's absences were excessive; the appellant had not raised a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency failed to act in good faith; a hearing was not required; and the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowens v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3244) (LCA calling for an end to unscheduled absences despite a legitimate reason for missing work). In another decision construing a good faith clause, <span class="Italic">May v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 654, 659 (1991), the Board directed a hearing on whether an agreement placing the appellant on probation because of past AWOL was violated when the appellant was removed for absence caused by a medical condition that was beyond his control, beyond his knowledge at the time he signed the agreement, and beyond the contemplation of the agency when it entered the <span id="Page_1145"></span>agreement. The AJ was, on remand, to decide the "legitimate factual issue" of whether the appellant breached the agreement. The AJ then was to determine the enforceability of the appeal waiver contained in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit found unacceptable summary disposition by the Board of an appeal based on an LCA in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991)--the Board must do more than accept the agency's version of events and dismiss an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Stewart in fact breached the last chance settlement agreement, we agree with the board that the waiver of appeal rights the agreement contains is enforceable because he freely entered into it....&#8197;But we do not understand the board's refusal to address the threshold issue of breach. The last chance agreement predicates the reimposition of removal and concomitant waiver of appeal rights on breach of one or more of the other stipulations the agreement contains. Where, as here, an employee raises a non-frivolous factual issue of compliance with a last chance agreement, the board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of the appeal rights waiver.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The waiver at issue here applies only to the facts underlying and the legal validity of the original removal. Stewart did not waive his right to contest breach of the agreement itself. We express no opinion whether an agency could require an employee to waive even this right and still successfully enforce the agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Though "[t]here is no statutory authority requiring the [board]to hold a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction,"...&#8197;"it would be appropriate for the [board]to honor a request for hearing where petitioner's allegations raise non-frivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which cannot be resolved simply on submissions of documentary evidence."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McClure v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 172, 176-77 (1994), directed a remand so that a hearing could be held on whether some time off for union business constituted a breach of an LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In order to establish the right to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant is not required to <span class="Italic">prove</span> the dispositive jurisdictional fact at issue but need only non-frivolously <span class="Italic">allege</span> it. <span class="Italic">See Hurwitz v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 436, 439-440 (1994). An administrative judge may dispose of an appeal without a hearing based on the agency's unrebutted documentary submissions but may not dismiss an appeal without a hearing if he is required to weigh the probative value of the evidence on disputed issues and resolve conflicting factual assertions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329-30 (1994). Because the appellant's assertion that she did not breach the last-chance settlement agreement raises such disputed questions of fact, it is nonfrivolous, and the administrative judge must therefore convene a jurisdictional hearing if the appellant requests one. <span class="Italic">See Pryor v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 49 MSPR 590, 594 (1991); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A hearing was directed for an appellant whose medical emergency led to absence characterized as AWOL under an LCA, <span class="Italic">Marrisette v. VA</span>, AT-0752-15-0680-I-1 (NP 8/11/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant reasserts that his supervisor was immediately notified after his hospitalization on March 21, 2013, and he submits statements from two coworkers in support of this claim. He further claims that he followed the proper procedures for requesting leave, but he did not receive an explanation from the agency why his request was denied. We interpret the appellant's claims as disputing the agency's claim that he breached the LCA. <span class="Italic">See Melnick v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 93, 97-98 (1989) (liberally construing a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's pleadings), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the record presents a legitimate factual issue of whether the appellant breached the LCA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (vacating and remanding the Board's decision to resolve the appellant's nonfrivolous allegation that he did not violate an LCA because he complied with agency policy to report his unscheduled absence, which was due to a medical emergency, as soon as possible); <span class="Italic">May v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 654, 658-59 (1991) (finding that the record presented a legitimate factual issue of whether the appellant breached the LCA when he alleged that his unscheduled absences and tardiness were due to sudden illness). The record contains evidence of the appellant's incapacitation because of a medical emergency, and subsequent surgery and rehabilitation. Under Medical Center Policy 05-02, employees are required to obtain advance approval for absences. However, the policy reflects an exception for emergencies and illnesses. In such cases, an employee must obtain approval "as early as practicable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has submitted statements from two coworkers that they immediately notified his supervisor about his hospitalization on the day of his March 21, 2013 injury. The appellant also alleged that he updated his supervisor throughout his recovery and informed him of his return date. Finally, the record contains evidence that the appellant properly requested leave after his injury and submitted medical documentation. If the appellant cannot demonstrate that he complied with the LCA, he should be afforded an opportunity to prove that the appeals rights waiver should not be enforced for other reasons. <span class="Italic">Rhett</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 13. For example, he may wish to present evidence and argument that, although he had exhausted his accrued leave, it was bad faith for the agency to deny his request for 6 months of LWOP, <span class="Italic">see Sambrano v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 449, &#x00B6; 4 (2011) (observing that, if an agency takes an adverse action for an employee's absence after denying LWOP that she requested for medical reasons, the Board will examine the record as a whole to determine whether the agency's denial of LWOP was reasonable under the circumstances).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of compliance with the settlement agreement and a jurisdictional hearing is required. If the administrative judge determines that the appellant breached the LCA, he then must address the scope and applicability of the asserted waiver of appeal rights in the LCA. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant did not breach the LCA, or that the LCA does not constitute a valid waiver of the appellant's right to appeal to the Board, he shall find that this removal appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction and adjudicate the merits of the appeal.</p>
