<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-50"><span class="space">e.</span> Other Minor Error</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robb v. DOD</span>, 77 MSPR 130, 133-34 (1997), sustained an adverse action based on 10 days of AWOL when the agency could only prove the employee was out nine days:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the information provided by the agency must be sufficiently specific to permit the employee to respond properly to the agency's charge, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lockett v. United States Marine Corps,</span> 37 MSPR 427, 429 (1988), the charge must be viewed in light of the accompanying specifications and circumstances, and should not be technically construed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">James v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 73 MSPR 300, 303 (1997). The notice of proposed removal clearly informed the appellant of the nature of the charge as well as the specific dates for which he was being charged with AWOL. Furthermore, a distinction must be drawn between the actual charge of AWOL and the factual narrative outlining the charge. While an agency must prove all of the elements of a charge in order for that charge to be sustained, <span class="Italic">see Burroughs v. Department of the Army,</span> 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the phrase "for ten (10) days or more" is descriptive in nature and, as such, does not create an additional element that must be demonstrated in order to prove the charge of AWOL in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Diaz v. Department of the Army,</span> 56 MSPR 415, 418 (1993) (the Board found that it was clear from the structure and language of the notice of proposed removal that the agency's discussion of the provision of unauthorized services for the purpose of personal gain was a narrative description of certain of the factual specifications regarding the charge of misuse or abuse of government property); <span class="Italic">Hanner v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 113, 118-19 (1992) (the Board found that the appellant had been charged with creating a disturbance outside his assigned work area and that the length of the resulting disruption to the workplace was a consequence of the misconduct rather than an element of the charge).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This characterization of "for ten (10) days or more" as being descriptive in nature rather than constituting an additional element of the charge of AWOL is further supported by the fact that the agency's table of penalties...is dependent upon the length of the AWOL period; thus, the use of the time descriptive in the charge relates to the penalty selection rather than the gravamen of the charge of AWOL. We therefore hold that the agency's charge can be sustained upon proof of fewer than 10 days of AWOL. <span class="Italic">Cf. Joyner</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Navy,</span> 57 MSPR 154, 158 (1993) (even if annual leave were substituted for part of the charged hours of AWOL, charge of AWOL would be sustained where actionable eight and one-half days of AWOL remained); <span class="Italic">Ely v. United States Postal Service,</span> 56 MSPR 103, 106 (1992) (even assuming the appellant reasonably believed that he had been fired on August 16, 1991, and therefore could not be charged with AWOL from that date on, his unexcused absence from July 29 to August 16, 1991, fully supports an AWOL charge).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Acree v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 73, 77-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15 (1998), presents another example of stress placed on the nature of the charge rather than on proof of descriptive information contained in the narrative supporting the charge. The appellant, who worked for the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator of national banks, was dismissed from his position as a computer specialist on a charge that he violated standards of conduct by trading in national bank stock options based on nonpublic information obtained from his employment. As a component of his defense, Acree argued that terms used in the charges characterizing the information he obtained as "sensitive" and "material" were terms of art and that the agency failed to prove those elements of its charge. The Board disagreed, concluding that the challenged terms were descriptive language rather than components of the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's failure to support each element of a charge by the requisite burden of proof results in a finding that the entire charge must fall. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of the Army,</span> 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The Board has also held, however, that a charge does not include all of the supporting descriptive phrases, which need not be proven. <span class="Italic">See Robb v. Department of Defense,</span> 77 MSPR 130, 133-134 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's use of the terms "sensitive" and "material" in the proposal and decision notices was descriptive, and, therefore, need not be proved to support the charges. As described above, the agency proposed the appellant's removal based upon the charge of "improper personal conduct, specifically trading in national bank stock options based on non-public information [he] obtained from [his] employment," and that these actions violated its standards of conduct and conflict of interest policies. The decision notice reflected this proposal's charge, stating that the agency's decision was based upon the appellant's improper personal conduct, specifically trading in national bank stock options based on non-public information obtained from his employment. Thus, neither the proposal nor the decision notice depends on the "materiality" or "sensitivity" of the information, and, therefore, the charge against the appellant did not allege that he used "sensitive" or "material" information while conducting his stock trades.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we acknowledge that both the proposal and decision notices refer to "sensitive" information, and the decision notice also included references to "material" information. The proposal ended by stating that the appellant could not perform his duties without access to "sensitive non-public information" concerning national banks, and that proposing his removal was, therefore, warranted. This reference, however, does not establish that the agency charged the appellant with using "sensitive" information. Instead, it indicates that the appellant's duties required that he have access to "sensitive" information, that the proposing official did not trust him with such access, and, therefore, believed that the removal penalty was warranted for his using nonpublic information for trading in bank stocks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the decision notice, which correctly recited the charge and specifically sustained it, stated the appellant's use of "sensitive non-public information" for personal gain was a "most serious offense" that could not be tolerated, that the removal penalty was appropriate because the appellant's misconduct was a serious breach of the code of conduct, that his work required access to "sensitive non-public information," that his actions were an absolute breach of his duties, and that he had compromised public confidence in the agency. The notice added that the appellant's attempt to obtain personal financial gain based on "sensitive non-public information" was extremely serious, that shattered the trust relationship he had with his supervisors, and that the agency could not allow him to be trusted with "sensitive," nonpublic information. These references, however, arose in the context of the penalty selection, rather than the charged misconduct itself, or arose in response to the appellant's reply to the proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is also no indication that either the proposal or decision notice meant these terms as terms of art. Both "sensitive" and "material" have common English meanings. "Sensitive," in the context of work, means highly secret or delicate, and "material" means substantial or important. <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language 884, 1300 (1989). Both of these definitions pertain to the concept of "non-public," as used in the two notices, and it is appropriate to give these terms their ordinary meaning rather than construe them technically. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v. Government Printing Office,</span> 5 MSPB 376, 5 MSPR 354, 358 (1981); <span class="Italic">Penaloza v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 4 MSPB 389, 4 MSPR 322, 326 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also Campbell v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 27 F.3d 1560, 1567-68 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Moreover, the form SF-50, memorializing and effecting the appellant's removal, contains neither of these terms. We therefore conclude that these references were descriptive terms that the agency need not prove to sustain its charge. <span class="Italic">See Robb,</span> 77 MSPR at 133-34.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of a charge asserting that a law enforcement officer improperly drew a gun rather than pointing the weapon, under <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. DOJ</span>, NY-0752-10-0081-I-1 (NP 10/7/2011), the variance was inconsequential because the appellant was on sufficient notice to defend against the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[7] We have considered the possibility that the specification was deficient because it asserted that the question asked of the appellant involved the drawing of the gun rather than pointing, but we believe that the appellant was on sufficient notice as to what conduct was in question in order to be able to assert a defense. The purpose of providing an employee with notice is to offer an employee the opportunity to present or resolve any factual disputes. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Board has held that imprecise statements such as this are not fatal to an agency's case <span id="Page_3177"></span>if the appellant is able to identify the event in question. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hayes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 378, 379-80 (1983) (holding that the agency's assertion that the event in question occurred on a different date did not deny the appellant due process because he understood what event the agency was referencing), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 727 F.2d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The appellant has not expressed any lack of understanding as to the conduct that the agency found objectionable. Therefore, we do not believe that the agency's use of the word "draw" when describing the question proffered by the police violated the appellant's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A difference in a statutory citation in the proposal and decision letters was not harmful error, Chin v. DOD, 2022 MSPB 34, &#x00B6; 19 (2022) (Member Limon dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found that the evidence demonstrated that the agency intended to charge the appellant with violating 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 661, and that the statement in the decision letter--that he had been charged with violating 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 641--appeared to be an administrative error. The administrative judge found that this error was harmless because there was no evidence that citing the incorrect statute caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion in this regard. We also discern no error with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant's due process rights were not violated because the notice of proposed removal provided him with the specific facts and circumstances underlying the charge against him, and he had an opportunity to make a meaningful response. See Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542-46.</p>

Cir. 2020) (Judge Newman dissenting) ((reh. en banc den., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210604091">998 F.3d 1312</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021)) ("Dr. Braun also refers to the fact that the Removal Decision described his conduct as 'misconduct,' whereas that word is absent from the Removal Proposal. But this contention adds nothing to the contention about the professional or agency standards. Dr. Braun identifies no concrete way in which that word played any role beyond aptly labeling the serious, long-term departures from standards of which he had adequate notice. He identifies no argument or evidence that he would have presented had the word 'misconduct' been included in the Removal Proposal. It is the substance of the charges, of which he had ample notice, that brought the conduct within the 'for cause' provision of the NIH Policy's &#x00A7; L(1).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Technical problems involved in the timing of the proposal notice will be disregarded if they are nonprejudicial. In <span class="Italic">Jahns v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 395, 400 (1983), the appellants were prematurely issued proposal and decision letters. After discovering its error, the agency rescinded the first set of documents and issued new proposal and decision letters. The appellants were not denied the opportunity to respond to the second notice, nor were they otherwise prejudiced.</p>
