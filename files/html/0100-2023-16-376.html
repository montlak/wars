<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-376"><span class="space">a.</span> Basis for Fees--Back Pay Act</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under the Reform Act there are two provisions allowing awards of counsel fees. The first, a component of the Back Pay Act, is 5 USC 5596. The other provision, establishing criteria for fee awards, is 5 USC 7701(g), incorporated by reference into &#x00A7; 5596. The basic conditions for a counsel fee award are simple: as charging party, the union should prevail in the case; back pay should result; and the fees should be found to be in the interest of justice. Not every prevailing charging party will obtain fees. If there is no back pay involved in the case, entitlement must be established, if at all, under the Equal Access to Justice Act. EAJA provides for fees only to respondents, i.e., unions who must defend complaints lodged by FLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS Houston Dist. and NTEU Chap. 222</span>, 25 FLRA 843, 846 n.1 (1987). May fees be awarded in ULP proceedings that do not invoke the benefits of the Back Pay Act, i.e., if employees are the victims of unfair labor practices but lose no money? The question was raised, but not answered, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Griffiss AFB, Rome and AFGE Local 2612</span>, 37 FLRA 570, 580 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge did not set forth any authority or rationale for the "make whole" part of his order. He directed that off-duty employees affected by the improper implementation be reimbursed for expenses including lawyer's fees and transportation costs as well as the restoration of annual leave. Such a remedy raises complicated questions, including whether it is within the Authority's power to order reimbursement of items such as lawyer fees and travel expenses, which do not qualify under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service and Internal Revenue Service, Austin District, and Internal Revenue Service, Houston District</span>, 23 FLRA 774, 782 (1986). However, we find it unnecessary to reach such questions here...</p>
<p class="noindent">[Refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-17-403.html#sec9-401">Necessity of Unjustified or Unwarranted Personnel Action and Award of Pay, Allowances or Differentials; Contract Violation</a>," for cases requiring back pay award as predicate to award of fees by an arbitrator.]</p>
<p class="noindent">On a motion for counsel fees involving a ULP successfully challenging a unilateral change in employment conditions, an ALJ considered the application of 5 USC 7701(g) and 5 USC 5596, and denied the fees without much analysis, <span class="Italic">DHUD, Region VI and AFGE Local 3320</span>, 13 FLRA 180, 199 (1983) (ALJ Decision):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ubstantial discretion rests upon the deciding body in determining when an award is warranted....&#8197;Congress expected that discretion to award attorney's fees would normally be exercised where agency action was clearly without merit, but that discretion permitted the deciding body to deny fees even where such circumstances are present....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, discretion is exercised to deny the award, as not warranted in the interest of justice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[R]espondent acted responsibly and without undue delay, in responding affirmatively to the charge. It did not delay proceedings, put any party to unnecessary proof, or act in an obdurate manner. It reverted back to the old rate and offered to reimburse any employee paid at the changed rate--all before the complaint in this action was filed. Its actions were taken voluntarily, and not pursuant to a settlement agreement or order of this Authority....&#8197;Under these circumstances, an award cannot be justified as "warranted in the public interest." Indeed, it would be contrary to the public interest, to a degree, in that it might discourage agencies from voluntary actions taken to correct personnel mistakes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Substance was added to the Back Pay Act fee analysis by <span class="Italic">DHUD, Region VI and AFGE Local 3320</span>, 24 FLRA 885, 888-92 (1986), reversing as unlawful a suspension of a union official:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interest of Justice</span>: If an obligation to pay fees has been incurred and the employee is a prevailing party, an award can be made if it is warranted in the interest of justice. Applying the guidelines established by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 593 (1980), the Judge determined that the requested award was not warranted in the interest of justice. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the Judge's recommended denial of attorney fees in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit clarified the application of the interest of justice standard enunciated in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. MSPB</span>, 746 F.2d 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. MSPB</span>, 772 F.2d 879 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">VanFossen v. MSPB</span>, 788 F.2d 748 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court explained that a decision on whether an agency's personnel action was "clearly without merit" or was "wholly unfounded," or whether the employee was "substantially innocent," should be based on the result of the appeal, not on the evidence available to the agency prior to the hearing. Pointing out that the purpose of providing for awards of fees is not punitive, but is intended to reduce employees' costs in defending against unsubstantiated agency actions, the court explained that an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice if on appeal any of these elements is present. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> and <span class="Italic">VanFossen</span>. The court has also explained that this determination, based on the result of the appeal, should be separate from and not qualified by, determinations regarding the agency's motivation when it initiated the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boese</span>. The court has specifically found that "all 'factually close' cases do not automatically fall in the class in which fees are not available in the interest of justice." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. MSPB</span>, 772 F.2d at 881.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the Federal Circuit's approach, we conclude that the result in the underlying unfair labor practice proceeding shows that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. The Respondent suspended Aguirri because he had engaged in certain conduct while acting for the Union. This action was found to be a violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute. The violations related to a disciplinary action against an individual who was the Union President.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that Aguirri had posted the statements with a good faith belief that they were true.&#x2003;He rejected the Respondent's assertion that they were posted with knowledge that they were false or in reckless disregard for the truth. He further found that the statements represented a legitimate concern of a union representative regarding labor relations matters and that Aguirri had posted the statements in accordance with the Union's established practice of keeping employees informed of the Union's activities. It is also significant that Counsel for Aguirri and the Union brought each of these matters to Respondent's attention in his responses to the charges leveled against his client. The Judge further detailed the existing legal precedent which the Judge ultimately found to warrant a finding that Aguirri was engaging in protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From all this we conclude that Aguirri was "substantially innocent" and that the Respondent's actions in threatening discipline against Aguirri and in suspending him from employment for five days were "clearly without merit," "wholly unfounded," and violative of law. Based on the result, we conclude that an award of attorney fees has been shown to be warranted in the interest of justice under the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> standards as interpreted by the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reasonableness of the amount of the award</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Counsel billed four (4) hours for work done in representing the employee in Respondent's disciplinary proceedings. Because these proceedings arose from and concerned the same facts which were at issue in the subsequent Authority proceedings, and an award has been determined to be warranted for the latter, we conclude that the award should cover this work. The billing of these four hours is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 86 FMSR 5007 (1986), and <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Coast Guard</span>, 85 FMSR 5362 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel billed one-quarter (1/4) hour for the drafting and submission of the unfair labor practice charge which gave rise to the General Counsel's complaint in this case. Although the services of an attorney are not necessary for this function, charges which are drafted and submitted with such assistance often are of value to the General Counsel in preparing and conducting an investigation. The billing of this one-quarter hour is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wells v. Schweiker</span>, 12 MSPB 329, 330 (1982) (fees awarded for work done in bringing necessary underlying facts to the attention of the MSPB Special Counsel).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel billed fifteen (15) hours for work in preparing for the hearing before the Judge, counsel's participation at the hearing, and the submission of a post-hearing brief. The Authority's Regulations provide that a party to an unfair labor practice case has the right to appear at any hearing <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">counsel</span>, to examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to introduce evidence, all subject to a decision by the Judge that such participation should be limited. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2423.15. They also provide that <span id="page_1648"></span>a party has the right to make an oral argument before the Judge at the end of the hearing and to file a brief on the issues raised for the Judge's consideration in deciding the case. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2423.24, 2423.25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since these aspects of participation are entitlements under the Authority's Rules and Regulations, we will not second-guess a party's decision to seek legal representation for such purposes in an unfair labor practice proceeding. Nor will we conclude, absent a specific showing, that participation by outside counsel was either duplicative of, or failed to make a substantial contribution to the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting a case. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Donovan v. CSEA Local Union 1000</span>, 784 F.2d 98, 106 (2d Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. CSEA Local Union 1000, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO v. Brock, </span>__U.S.__, 107 S. Ct. 74 (1986)...&#8197;Although such fee requests must be carefully scrutinized, the mere presence of an administrative prosecutor does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> preclude an award for contributions to the proceedings made by outside counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Donovan v. CSEA Local Union 1000</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The specific inclusion of a fee award provision for unfair labor practice proceedings in the Back Pay Act further negates such an interpretation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case the record does not provide any basis for finding that the efforts of Counsel for Aguirri and the Union were either duplicative of or failed to make a substantial contribution to the prosecution of the case.&#x2003;To the contrary, Counsel participated actively and pursued pertinent lines of questioning of witnesses different from those of Counsel for the General Counsel. The Authority is cognizant of the sometimes differing roles and interests of the General Counsel and charging parties or individuals on behalf of whom a charge is filed. This distinction in large part provides the basis for the right of a charging party to participate and be represented by counsel....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel billed five (5) hours for investigation of the unfair labor practice. Although the investigation of an unfair labor practice charge and a decision on whether a complaint should issue based on the investigation are responsibilities of the General Counsel, like work performed during the Respondent's disciplinary proceedings, the ultimate success of Aguirri's case demonstrates that the investigation materially advanced that effort. There is no showing that the five hours spent in assisting the investigation were duplicative of, or failed to make a substantial contribution to the General Counsel's efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel billed two (2) hours for the preparation of the papers in support of the motion for attorney fees. This is customarily considered appropriate for inclusion as part of an award of fees. The billing of this two hours is granted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The total number of hours of service thus approved is 26.25 hours. Since these fees are to be paid to the attorney, Steven M. Angel, and not to the Union's treasury for reimbursement to the Union for costs of services it provided out of its funds, a market rate rather than a "salary plus overhead," or "cost-plus" rate is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. U.S. Department of Treasury</span>, 656 F.2d 848, 850 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Wells v. Schweiker</span>, 12 MSPB 329, 331-32) (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requested billing rate is $90.00 per hour. Counsel's affidavit states, without dispute by Respondent or the General Counsel, that this represents the customary rate awarded him in other personnel cases. The requested billing rate is not unreasonable on its face nor does in greatly exceed the rate permitted under the Equal Access to Justice Act. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2430.4. We will allow a billing rate of $90.00 per hour in this case....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel also requests $82.35 for the cost of the trial transcript. This request must be denied because the transcript constitutes a "taxable cost" under 28 USC 1920(2). There is no statutory right of recovery for stenographic fees for transcripts in an administrative proceeding under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1140 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHUD Region VI</span> was reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 32 FLRA 20, 26-28 (1988), involving a determination that the employer failed to comply with reinstatement provisions of an arbitration award. Fees may be paid to union counsel under the Back Pay Act when the prevailing party is the union acting on behalf of an employee who receives the benefit of a ULP determination. The employee is not required to file ULP charges in addition to the union to provide a basis for fee recovery. Additionally, <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span> determined that counsel representing the employee may recover fees in addition to fees recovered by union counsel. As to any counsel seeking fees, however, FLRA emphasized in <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...(1) a rule of law making attorney fee awards inappropriate <span class="Italic">per se</span> when the General Counsel prosecutes an unfair labor practice case is unwarranted because such a rule would nullify the specific provision of the Back Pay Act authorizing attorney fee awards in unfair labor practice cases; and (2) fee requests must be carefully scrutinized to determine whether and to what extent participation by outside counsel contributed to the General Counsel's efforts in prosecuting the case or merely duplicated those efforts. As is the case with establishing that the other elements necessary for an award of fees have been met, the fee requestor must show how counsel's participation is to be viewed against that standard....</p>
<p class="noindent">Failure of an agency to comply with an arbitration award satisfied the interest of justice standard regarding union counsel who prosecuted ULP compliance proceedings in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1097 (1988) (agency's failure to comply fully with arbitration award was "clearly without merit"); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 46 FLRA 1080, 1092 (1992) ("having found that the Respondent's refusal to comply with the award was an action clearly without merit, the Judge was not required to set forth his findings with any greater degree of specificity").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reaffirmed its authority to award counsel fees under the Back Pay Act against respondents in ULP cases. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1090 (1988) (denial of shift differential was successfully challenged in arbitration: award of fees based on ULP enforcement proceedings determining that agency had not complied with arbitration award requiring back pay to grievants); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin Compliance Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 247</span>, 48 FLRA 1281, 1292-93 (1994) (award of fees in interest of justice because respondent's actions in delaying reinstatement and payment of back pay to employee, following arbitration award, were clearly without merit); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 46 FLRA 1080, 1091 (1992) (FLRA order finding violation of Statute for failing to award back pay to employee is effectively determination that employee was affected by unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in loss of pay).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Back Pay Act speaks of the right of an "employee" to receive reasonable attorney fees related to a personnel action, the entitlement extends to the employee's (union) counsel. A strict reading of the language of the statute, with the effect that counsel could not receive fees, but employees could, would "strangle" the meaning of the Act. Congress did not intend to banish unions or their salaried lawyers from the realm of reasonable remuneration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 944 F.2d 922, 932 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (ULP when agency refused to abide by arbitration award reinstating employee: "[A]fter imposing upon unions and their lawyers the responsibility of employee representation in areas vital in the scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act, it would have been the height of irony for Congress to deny them the blessing of the Back Pay Act."). Under <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the employee need not be a party to an arbitration involving his interests for fee entitlements to accrue to the union; nor need fees be incurred by the employee, i.e., the union may recover fees even if the employee's representation was without charge to the employee. The FLRA added in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 994 F.2d 20, 24 (D.C. Cir. 1993), that the Back Pay Act also permits an order granting fees for litigating fee issues. Under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3882</span>, the interest of justice warranting "fees for fees" arises from the employing agency's conduct in the underlying personnel action, not from FLRA's position in the fee litigation. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3882</span>, interestingly, the employer, the Bureau of Prisons, intervened in the appellate litigation. Rather than directing that the additional fees incurred in fee litigation (arising from the FLRA's position concerning market rate or cost basis payments) be paid by the Bureau--the organization that caused the problem at the workplace leading the litigation resulting in fees and disputes over the measurement of those fees--FLRA was directed to pay the fees.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Back Pay Act does not furnish authority to FLRA to award counsel fees for the time spent by counsel pursuing the arbitration case that led to the ULP enforcement proceedings. The fee petition for time spent in arbitration should be directed to the arbitrator, not to FLRA, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Hq., 832d Combat Support Group, DPCE, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1093:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the Arbitrator is the appropriate authority for an award of fees for the arbitration. The second sentence of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.806(a) states that a request for attorney fees "may be presented only to the appropriate authority that corrected or directed the correction of the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Respondent violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement, and he directed that the employees receive the premium pay that they lost when the Respondent denied them access to the swing shift.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision to correct the Respondent's action and grant the employees back pay was not made on appeal. Thus, the third sentence in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.806(a)...is not applicable in this case. The Union's resort to the FLRA unfair labor practice procedures was an effort by the Union to enforce the arbitration award through a separate and independent proceeding rather than an appeal from a decision by an appropriate authority....&#8197;Thus, we conclude that the appropriate authority to award attorney fees for the arbitration award is the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA is not inclined to provide fee awards as remedies outside the statutory authorizations found in the Back Pay Act or EAJA, discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>. Under FLRA regulations, EAJA fees are available only to a respondent, other than the United States, who prevails against the General Counsel in a ULP proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 40 FLRA 775, 786-87 (1991). The remedy of counsel fees as reimbursement for a union that retained counsel to conduct impact negotiations when the union official was denied official time was considered in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys. and Council of Prison Locals, AFGE</span>, 12 FLRA 9 (1983). FLRA determined that reimbursement of the fees would not be appropriate. It was <span id="page_1649"></span>not shown that the union official could not have conducted the negotiations on annual leave or leave without pay and then claimed official time through the ULP procedure. FLRA declined to state when it would be appropriate to reimburse the union for counsel fees. Under <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 112 S. Ct. 2638 (1992), a Back Pay Act fee award may not be enhanced because the case is undertaken on the basis of a contingent fee agreement.
