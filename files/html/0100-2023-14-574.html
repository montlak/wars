<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-575"><span id="page_1043"></span><span class="space">1.</span> Freeze on Positions; Attrition; Creation of Positions</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that would, following a general RIF notice, temporarily preclude management from hiring persons outside the agency to fill vacant positions in the unit was reconsidered as a result of <span class="Italic">ACT, Montana Air Chap. v. FLRA</span>, 756 F.2d 172, 179-80 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (following <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183, 1186-88 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). In <span class="Italic">ACT Montana</span>, the D.C. Circuit determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's conclusion that section 7106 requires bargaining in these circumstances only at the election of the agency is clearly incorrect. That section reflects the basic principle...that although management has a right to make the substantive decisions with respect to certain subjects, it is nonetheless required to negotiate both over procedures for implementing such decisions and over arrangements for employees adversely affected by such decisions. As our precedents make clear, this obligation to bargain over the "impact and implementation" of agency decisions extends to proposed procedures or arrangements that would to some extent interfere with the exercise of management rights under section 7106(a)...so long as they would not prevent the agency from "acting at all." Moreover, under our decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, proposals to make "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by a RIF" are negotiable under subsection (b)(3) even if they would directly interfere with the exercise of management's authority under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA decided on remand that the proposal was nonnegotiable. It delayed pending completion of the RIF implementation of any management decision to add to the workforce by hiring from outside the agency. The agency would be required for a time to work with a smaller workforce. Employees would have the right to maximize the possibility of retaining jobs by preserving all available vacant positions for placement through assignment rights. In a National Guard unit even a relatively short delay in staffing positions could severely hamper the readiness of the Guard. That risk caused excessive interference with management's right to provide the numbers and types of employees to perform agency work. As a result, the proposal was not an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">ACT, Mont. Air Chap. and Montana Air Nat'l Guard, Hq. 120th Fighter Interceptor Group</span>, 20 FLRA 717, 728 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-203 and Dept. of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Serv.</span>, 55 FLRA 1081, 1088-89 (1999) (Proposal 5) (nonnegotiable infringement on management's right to hire: proposal requiring agency to bargain on whether to impose hiring freeze to protect employees' reemployment rights; the union did not offer a claim of negotiability as procedure or arrangement).</p>
<p class="noindent">A different result was reached in <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 142 (1987) (Provision 32), involving a proposal requiring the agency to eliminate outside recruitment efforts during a RIF:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that this proposal is distinguishable from Union Proposal 1 in the <span class="Italic">Montana Air National Guard</span> case which the Authority found to excessively interfere with the agency's ability to determine the numbers and types of employees need to perform its mission. The Authority's decision in that case was based upon the need of the National Guard to be able to obtain sufficient personnel to maintain a constant state of readiness for military deployment. No similar consideration is present here. Also, Provision 32 in this case provides that vacant positions are to be filled by "qualified" employees. This leaves the Agency with discretion to determine whether the employees who would otherwise be separated are qualified to fill the vacant positions and, consequently, to hire from outside the Agency if none of the affected employees are qualified....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Plate Printers</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Fin. Mgmt. Serv.</span>, 29 FLRA 422, 430 (1987), pronouncing negotiable as an appropriate arrangement a proposal precluding the agency from filling vacancies with candidates from outside the agency subdivision during a RIF if there were qualified employees available who would be laid off.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 65 FLRA 911, 914 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 680 F.3d 826 (D.C. Cir. 2012)), required bargaining as an arrangement a proposal to delay filling certain positions pending a RIF. Proposal 2 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547</span> was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the [e]mployer determines to fill positions from an external source because of mission requirements, and after a notice of proposed RIF has been presented to the Union, unless the [e]mployer shows to the Union that the particular position being filled will be a job series not affected by the RIF, no positions will be filled with the discretionary VRA appointments until after all of the RIFs are completed. All "[t]emporary" and "[t]erm" positions will be included in the RIFs.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal was negotiable, 65 FLRA at 915:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To constitute an appropriate arrangement, a proposal must meet two requirements: it must be intended as an arrangement and it must be appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id.; NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 2 is an arrangement. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to meet the first requirement, the Union must identify: (1) the adverse effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and (2) show that the arrangement is sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering those adverse effects. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 satisfies the first <span class="Italic">KANG </span>requirement. The impending RIF action and the possible consequence of termination from employment would have a severe, negative impact on any employee who undergoes them. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Fort Bragg Dependents Sch., Fort Bragg, N.C., </span>49 FLRA 333, 352 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 is also sufficiently tailored because it benefits employees who could be affected by the RIF.&#x2003;The purpose of suspending the filling of positions with excepted service employees unless the positions are in a job series not affected by the RIF, or until after all of the RIFs are completed, is to prevent any decrease during the RIF in the number of positions available to competitive service employees for bump and retreat purposes. By doing this, the proposal mitigates the adverse effect of the RIF on affected employees. Therefore, Proposal 2 is an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The arrangement is appropriate. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the second <span class="Italic">KANG </span>requirement--that the proposal is appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights--the Authority weighs the benefits the proposal affords to employees against the burden on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Proposal 2 limits the Agency's ability to use certain appointment authorities until the RIF is completed, it provides a substantial benefit to employees affected by the RIF. Proposal 2 protects against the reduction of employee bump and retreat opportunities during the RIF. In contrast, the burden on the Agency's ability to hire is not substantial. For example, under the proposal, the hiring limitation imposed on the Agency is not absolute. The proposal's hiring limitation only applies to RIF-affected positions. Further, although the Agency would be unable to hire VRA applicants into RIF-affected positions for the duration of the RIF, the Agency would still be able to fill vacancies during the RIF from other sources. Moreover, the hiring restriction is only effective until the termination of the RIF, which is ultimately a matter under the Agency's control. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 24 FLRA 479, 481 (1986). Therefore, balancing the demonstrated benefit to employees against the burden on management's rights, we find that the proposal does not excessively interfere with management's rights and, therefore, constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1367</span>, 64 FLRA 869, 871-72 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, Proposal 2 is within the duty to bargain.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;The decisions upon which the dissent relies are inapposite. In this regard, several of the decisions involved either no allegations, or bare assertions, regarding &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 53 FLRA 403, 416-18 (1997); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 171-75 (1993) (Member Armendariz concurring in part and dissenting in part); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-82</span>, 43 FLRA 25, 34-36 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Local R5-82</span>); <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers, Die Stampers &#x0026; Engravers Union of N. Am., AFL-CIO, Local 2</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 144-46 (1987). Finally, the proposals in the one remaining decision, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923</span>, 44 FLRA 1405 (1992), placed a substantially greater burden on management's rights than does Proposal 2. Specifically, those proposals required the agency to fill certain vacancies, regardless of whether vacancies existed or whether management wanted to fill them. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1462-70. Proposal 2, which places temporary, partial restrictions on the Agency's ability to fill vacant positions, has no comparable effect.</p>
<p class="noindent">Earlier FLRA decisions concluded that proposals for agencies to freeze vacancies prior to taking a RIF action, train employees for vacancies, use overtime rather than hire permanent employees, avoid filling vacant positions, and freeze Schedule C positions, were infringements on management's right to assign employees, hire employees, and determine the numbers, types, and grades of employees. Together, the proposals constituted an impermissible restriction on the right of management to lay off employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 18 FLRA 418, 420-22 (1985) (Proposal 2). The rights of the agency to lay off employees and contract out were infringed by proposals that management be required to make job-sharing proposals to the union and that management freeze contracting out to help avoid a RIF. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 18 FLRA 418, 423 (1985) (Proposal 4). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-123.html#sec6-124">Contracting Out</a>," concerning limitations on contracting out.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable only at the election of the agency was a proposal that during a RIF or other reorganization the parties negotiate as to whether a hiring freeze is needed to protect reemployment rights of employees and establish a joint freeze review board to determine when the freeze should end. The proposal was directly and integrally related to the numbers and types of personnel to be employed. FLRA rejected the argument that the proposal provided appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right to realign the workforce. Alleviation of the impact <span id="page_1044"></span>would only be accomplished through a matter that management had the right to elect not to negotiate. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1332 and Hq., Army Materiel Dev. and Readiness Command, Alexandria</span>, 3 FLRA 611 (1980). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">ACT, Montana Air Chap. v. FLRA</span>, 756 F.2d 172, 179-80 (D.C.

FLRA</span>, 730 F.2d 1534, 1547-49 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Hiring or placement freeze proposals were revisited as to internal placement in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Energy</span>, 24 FLRA 479, 480-82 (1986), <span class="Italic">enforcement</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 895 F.2d 152, 155-56 (4th Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">post</span>, involving a proposal that the filling of bargaining unit vacancies in the competitive area of employees who would be affected by a RIF be suspended from the date of the initial RIF notice to affected eligible employees until the effective date of the RIF. The proposal was negotiable. FLRA decided (Chairman Calhoun filing a concurring opinion based on an appropriate arrangements analysis):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Agency decides to fill a vacancy covered by proposal during a RIF, the proposal only requires the Agency to either fill that vacancy with an eligible bargaining unit employee affected by the RIF or delay filling the vacancy until the RIF is over. Hence, the proposal merely delays management's exercise of its rights to select an employee from any appropriate source...and, correlatively, to hire from outside the bargaining unit.... This delay only would occur in very limited circumstances when (1) there is a qualified individual in the bargaining unit, (2) that employee would be affected by the RIF, and (3) management decides not to select that employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From these facts, it is our conclusion that the proposal would not impose any substantive criteria on management's exercise of its rights. Rather, the proposal would establish a procedure for management to follow in exercising its rights--albeit one which, under the very narrow circumstances outlined above, would delay management's ability to select from appropriate sources other than the bargaining unit until after the RIF....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1332 and Headquarters, Army Material Development and Readiness Command, Alexandria, Virginia</span>, 3 FLRA 611 (1980), where the Authority held nonnegotiable a proposal requiring a hiring freeze because it was integrally related to management's right under section 7106(b)(1) to determine the numbers and types of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision. In that case the Authority found the proposal prevented the agency from hiring new employees of the requisite types and grades in sufficient number while the freeze was in effect.... [T]he proposal in this case only delays the Agency filling the vacancy when the Agency decides not to select an eligible bargaining unit employee affected by the RIF. This proposal does not prevent the Agency from hiring additional employees from outside the unit when there are no eligible employees within the unit. Consequently, this proposal does not affect the Agency's ability to determine the numbers and types of employees needed to perform its work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is clear that unlike the proposal in the Authority's Decision and Order on Remand in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782 and Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</span>, 14 FLRA 801 (1984), affirmed in the Authority's Decision and Order on Motion for Reconsideration (July 11, 1985), <span class="Italic">affirmed sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, No. 85-1562 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 21, 1986), and cases based on that decision, the proposal in this case is not inconsistent with Requirement 4 of subchapter 1-4, chapter 335 of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM). Requirement 4, which provides for an agency's right to fill positions from any appropriate source, applies to positions filled through merit promotion procedures. Requirement 4 does not apply to position changes permitted by reduction in force regulations.... Since section 351.201(b) of the OPM RIF regulations gives an agency discretion to fill vacant positions during a RIF with affected employees, the vacant positions covered by the Union's proposal are not subject to the competitive procedures set forth in chapter 335 of the FPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A <span class="Italic">dictum</span> in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1450 and Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 23 FLRA No. 1 (1986), states otherwise and will not be followed. To the extent that the proposal in that case concerns position changes permitted by the RIF regulations, Requirement 4 would not apply to that proposal. Proposals which concern the filling of positions after the effective date of a RIF, however, even if the proposals concern employees adversely affected by the RIF, are subject to the provisions of chapter 335....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">CREA and Library of Congress, Congressional Research Serv.</span>, 25 FLRA 306, 337 (1987) (Proposal 10), approving a freeze proposal soliciting a delay in filling unit positions for at least 90 days after a RIF notice to affected employees who could qualify for the positions. The delay would occur only when: there is a qualified individual in the unit; that employee is affected by the RIF; and management decides not to select that employee. The employer was not prohibited from detailing an employee to a position covered by the proposal. Following the same analysis, a proposal was approved for negotiations that required the employer to restrict reassignments and competitive promotions during a RIF and to give priority consideration to personnel who received a general notice of RIF who also met the basic eligibility requirements for those positions. The proposal established an acceptable procedure that did not prevent the agency from acting at all in the exercise of its rights. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region X</span>, 25 FLRA 1041, 1055 (1987) (Proposal 4); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Walla Walla</span>, 44 FLRA 1145, 1187, 1191 (1992) (approving as negotiable Proposal 15, requiring that "[t]he filling of bargaining unit vacancies in the competitive area of employees who would be affected by a RIF shall be suspended from the date of the initial RIF notice to the affected employees to the effective date of the RIF"; the proposal was construed to permit management to fill unit position during freeze with unit employee qualified for that position); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 31 FLRA 566, 579 (1988) (approving arrangements bargaining as to proposal that defined use of furlough schedule that would be consistent with agency workload requirements). An absolute freeze was rejected in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 FLRA 987, 989, 992 (1987) (Proposal 1). The proposal did not permit the agency to hire additional employees from outside the unit during the freeze if no eligible employees could be located within the unit. <span class="Italic">Local 12</span> also rejected Proposal 2, requiring cancelation, in the event of a RIF, of personnel actions on or after a certain date, the purpose being to free up positions for use with assignment rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 152, 155-56 (4th Cir. 1990), the circuit court was unwilling to approve FLRA's negotiability determination that a freeze in bargaining unit reassignments and competitive promotions in the event of a RIF was an appropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The FLRA determines whether a proposed "arrangement" is "appropriate" for bargaining by applying the "excessive interference" test. The competing practical needs of employees and managers are weighed in the light of various factors, so as to determine whether, on balance, the impact of the proposal on management's rights is excessive when compared to the benefits afforded employees.... As the NRC could fill vacant positions by outside hires, Chairman Calhoun observed that the proposal, which "applied only to positions filled through reassignments and promotions within the bargaining unit," "placed an insubstantial burden on management when compared to the potential benefit on affected employees and was, therefore, negotiable as an appropriate arrangement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We, however, disagree. The Union freeze proposal clearly contravenes the rights reserved to federal agencies under the management rights clause of &#x00A7; 7106 as an "appropriate arrangement." There is little doubt that restricting the pool of available personnel to fill agency positions (particularly when that restriction may eliminate the most qualified applicants--experienced employees) is a direct interference with the NRC's exclusive right to select and determine the personnel by which agency operations should be conducted.... Furthermore...the proposal's marginal benefit to unit members, combined with substantial adverse consequences to management's reserved rights, renders it non-negotiable as an "appropriate arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the NRC as a whole constitutes <span class="Italic">one</span> bargaining unit, it comprises ten competitive areas. Under the literal language of the proposal, a RIF limited to one competitive area would freeze promotions and reassignments in all areas. Thus, a RIF of NRC lawyers located at Washington, D.C. would prevent the NRC from filling an engineer vacancy on the West Coast, a position the laid-off lawyers would be neither eligible nor qualified for. Furthermore, under the proposed freeze, management cannot fill the West Coast vacancy at all, unless it hires outside the agency (or, arguably, at least outside the bargaining unit), without regard as to who is best qualified to fill that position.... As a RIF is not limited to a particular duration, the vacancy could remain open indefinitely. The potential for depriving the NRC of key personnel, and contemporaneously of the pool of best qualified applicants, while affixing no precise duration and with little discernible benefit to the bargaining unit members, impermissibly interferes with management's operation of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Union's laudable motives do not disguise the fact that the Union's proposed freeze on competitive promotions and reassignments within the bargaining unit during a RIF excessively interferes with management's reserved right to fill vacant positions with the best qualified candidates from any acceptable source. We do not reject such a measure out of hand. It may be possible to tailor such a freeze sufficiently to accomplish the desired benefits for bargaining unit members while avoiding a dire impact on management's rights and efficient operation....</p>
<p class="noindent">Related to the proposal to freeze positions is the proposal to avoid RIFs to the extent possible by accomplishing reductions through attrition. That proposal was approved for negotiation, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l INS Council and INS</span>, 27 FLRA 467, 478-79 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he provision is to the same effect as...<span class="Italic">Congressional Research Employees Association and Library of Congress, Congressional Research Service</span>, 25 <span id="page_1045"></span>FLRA No. 21 (1987). In that case, the Authority found that the language "to the extent that it is practicable" and "whenever possible" mandated that the agency exhaust other cost-saving methods, including attrition before conducting a RIF, and prevented the agency from exercising its...right to layoff employees without using alternative cost-saving measures first. We also concluded that the cost-saving methods suggested in these proposals interfered with the management right to determine the personnel by which agency operations would be conducted.... However, we found that the requirement that the agency utilize attrition and other cost-saving measures did not excessively interfere with management's exercise of its rights and thus constituted appropriate arrangements....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also asserts that the provision is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with a Government-wide regulation--Requirement 4 of FPM Chapter 335, which grants management the right to select from any appropriate source. In this regard, the Agency interprets the provision as requiring management to fill vacancies by reassignment to avoid laying off employees. However, there is nothing in the language of the provision which dictates that management must reassign employees to accomplish reductions. Rather the provision speaks specifically of utilizing attrition to avoid RIFs. Moreover, the Union states that the provision was not intended to prevent management from hiring from sources other than employees who might be adversely affected by a RIF....</p>
<p class="noindent">For another negotiable proposal, mandating that the agency use attrition to avoid a RIF when possible, refer to <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 842 (1991) (Provision 15)<span class="Italic">. NAGE Locals R5-136 and R5-150 and VA, Ralph H. Johnson Med. Ctr.</span>, 55 FLRA 679, 682-84 (1999), decided a proposal was negotiable to phase in a reorganization through attrition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the intent of the proposal is to phase in the reorganization through attrition.&#x2003;As the Union's statement of intent comports with the proposal's wording, we adopt this explanation and interpret the proposal as requiring the reorganization to be phased in by attrition--as currently occupied ward and lead medical clerk positions are vacated in medical administration service, the positions will be converted to health care technician positions in nursing and patient care service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Proposal Affects Management's Right to Determine its Organization</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute encompasses the right to determine the administrative and functional structure of the agency, including the relationship of personnel through lines of authority and the distribution of responsibilities for delegated and assigned duties. In other words, this right includes the authority to determine how an agency will structure itself to accomplish its mission and functions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3807 and U.S. Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration, Golden, Colorado, </span>54 FLRA 642, 647 (1998) <span class="Italic">(WAPA).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal delays the Agency from fully implementing its reorganization until, through attrition, existing clerks no longer encumber any ward and lead medical clerk positions. As such, the proposal affects the Agency's right to determine its organization. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (proposal that would require management to alter a reorganization plan affects management's right to determine its organization).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Proposal is not a Procedure under Section 7106(b)(2)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[P]roposals that preclude an agency from exercising a management right unless or until other events occur are generally not within the duty to bargain. Neither party in this case has requested the Authority to reexamine this precedent. Applying this precedent in this case, this proposal is not a procedure under section 7106(b)(2). The proposal delays the Agency from fully implementing its reorganization until, through attrition, existing clerks no longer encumber any ward and lead medical clerk positions. Conditioning full implementation on attrition will delay the reorganization for an indeterminate period of time. Accordingly, as the proposal does not come within the exception for proposed delays pending completion of bargaining, we conclude that the proposal is not within the duty to bargain as a procedure under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The Proposal is not an Appropriate Arrangement under Section 7106(b)(3)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The test for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG). </span>Under this test, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended as an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement seeks to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">See Department of the Treasury v. FLRA, </span>960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal constitutes an arrangement, a union must identify the effects, or reasonably foreseeable effects, on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., National Federation of Federal Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2015 and U.S. Department of the Interior,</span> <span class="Italic">National Park Service, Washington, D.C., </span>53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 11 64 and Social Security Administration District Office, New Bedford, Massachusetts, 54</span> FLRA 1327, 1333,(1998). Section 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain proposals that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights<span class="Italic">. See id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior v. FLRA, </span>969 F.2d 1158, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). Section 7106(b)(3) does not bring within the duty to bargain proposals that are so broad in their sweep that the "balm" would be applied to employees indiscriminately without regard to whether the group as a whole is likely to suffer, or has suffered, adverse effects as the consequence of management action under section 7106. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, the Authority determines whether it is appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with any applicable management rights. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In determining whether the proposal excessively interferes with a management right, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, without deciding, that the proposal in this case constitutes an arrangement under the first inquiry in the <span class="Italic">KANG </span>analysis, we conclude that the proposed arrangement is not appropriate under the second inquiry in that analysis because it excessively interferes with management's right to determine its organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's current organization aligns the administrative side of patient care and recordkeeping within medical administrative service. The reorganization implements a service line organization which incorporates a unified team approach to the delivery of patient care where the clerks are an integral part of the unified patient services team. The proposal restricts and burdens the Agency by requiring the Agency to implement its unified team approach to the delivery of patient care through attrition. <span class="Italic">See National Association of Government Employees, Local R3-76 and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Automated Printing Service, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 55</span> FLRA 509, 512 (1999) <span class="Italic">(DLA) </span>(proposal that would significantly alter management's proposed reorganization placed severe restrictions on management's ability to establish an organizational structure that meets its needs); <span class="Italic">WAPA, </span>54 FLRA at 649 (proposal that would require management to alter a reorganization plan and prevent management from making its operations more efficient places a "heavy burden" on management); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">3509 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Greenwood,</span> <span class="Italic">South Carolina District, </span>46 FLRA 1590, 1606 (1993) <span class="Italic">(SSA, Greenwood) </span>(proposal that would require management to alter the organizational placement of a position would result in a "significant negative impact" on management's right to determine its organization). Moreover, by requiring implementation of the reorganization through attrition, the delay is of an unknown duration. Without any indication of the extent of the temporal impact, the Authority cannot determine that on balance, the delay is reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In somewhat similar circumstances, the Authority determined that a 6-year delay in implementing a qualification requirement excessively interfered with management's rights because the negative effect on management's right to determine qualifications outweighed the benefit to employees of allowing them 6 years to obtain the required certification. <span class="Italic">See National</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1214 and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Health Services Command,</span> <span class="Italic">Moncrief Army Community Hospital, Fort Jackson,</span> <span class="Italic">South Carolina, </span>40 FLRA 1181, 1190 (1991). Earlier, when the same qualification requirement was proposed to be phased in through attrition by making it voluntary for current employees, the Authority determined that the proposal excessively interfered with management's right because it would preclude application of the requirement to current employees. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Government Employees, Local 738 and Department of the Army, Headquarters, USA Medical</span> <span class="Italic">Department Activity, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, 34</span> FLRA 809, 814 (1990). Similarly, the Authority determined that a proposal that would have grandfathered current employees from having to meet certain new certification requirements excessively interfered with management's rights by totally preventing management from implementing new qualification requirements for the grandfathered employees. <span class="Italic">See Overseas Education</span> <span class="Italic">Association, Inc. and Department of Defense Dependents Schools, </span>29 FLRA 734, 806 (1987) (proposal 53), <span class="Italic">enforced as to other matters, </span>872 F.2d 1032 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1046"></span>The Union has described benefits to employees in the areas of leave, training, promotion, and performance evaluation by delaying the implementation of the reorganization. Although the proposal would afford current clerks meaningful benefits, these benefits would result from restrictions on the Agency's ability to establish an organizational structure that meets its needs. The indeterminate nature of the temporal impact of the Union's proposal raises the possibility of delaying the reorganization for many years. In weighing the burden, restrictions, and negative impact imposed by the proposal on management's right to determine its organization against the benefits afforded employees by the proposal, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to determine its organization under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See DLA, </span>55 FLRA at 512; <span class="Italic">WAPA, </span>54 FLRA at 649; <span class="Italic">SSA, Greenwood, 46</span> FLRA at 1606-07....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that the agency not contract out its functions, if positions in those functions were to be abolished or downgraded, for one year after the effective date of a RIF. The proposal delayed but did not prevent contracting out and left the agency certain discretion during the covered period. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 FLRA 987, 999 (1987) (Proposal 4). <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria</span>, 49 FLRA 874 (1994), arrived at a different result, determining to be nonnegotiable without an arrangements claim a proposal that the agency not contract out its functions if positions in those functions were to be abolished or downgraded, for one year after the effective date of a RIF. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local</span> <span class="Italic">1655</span>, 49 FLRA at 890 (Provision 10) (relying on<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 174 (1993) (Proposal 11: "certain proposals precluding an agency from exercising a management right unless or until other events occurred directly interfered with that right")).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal, offered as an arrangement, that required management to continue to employ in his same position the same individual who was to lose his job through a reorganization. The interests of the employee did not justify an effective prohibition of management's reorganization plan. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3807 and Dept. of Energy, WAPA</span>, 54 FLRA 642, 649 (1998) (Proposal 1). Proposals designed to head off the effects of a reorganization through agreement that the agency maintain a certain number of positions in specified organizational units interfered with management's right to assign work. Because the proposals concerned the numbers, types, and grades of employees assigned to an organizational subdivision, the proposals were bargainable at the election of the agency. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 49 and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 55 FLRA 25, 26-27 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 64 FLRA 813, 816-18 (2010), determined to be nonnegotiable Proposal 11, calling for a delay of a RIF while excepted service Veterans Readjustment Act employees were converted to the competitive service, making those positions available to more senior competitive service employees for bump and retreat purposes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 11 is outside the duty to bargain because it affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2), and is not an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;Proposal 11 affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute the Agency's claims that Proposal 11 affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2). Accordingly, we assume, without deciding, that Proposal 11 affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 617 (2003) (assuming without deciding that proposal concerns the exercise of a management right).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;Proposal 11 is not an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated with regard to Proposal 10, above, when a proposal affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, the proposal is nevertheless within the duty to bargain if it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 115</span>6, 63 FLRA at 341. A proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement if it is: (1) intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights. E.g., <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 11 is not an arrangement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal must meet two requirements to constitute an arrangement.&#x2003;To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2280, Iron Mountain, Mich.</span>, 57 FLRA 742, 743 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Iron Mountain</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1687</span>, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1687</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 11 satisfies the first, but not the second requirement for being an arrangement. Regarding the adverse effect requirement, there is no dispute that the employees here are undergoing RIF actions. Such actions, which can result in an employee's termination from employment, can have a severe, negative impact on any employee who undergoes them. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Fort Bragg Dependents Sch., Fort Bragg, N.C., </span>49 FLRA 333, 352 (1994). Proposal 11 is intended to ameliorate this adverse effect by including VRA employees in a RIF, thereby making more positions available to senior competitive service employees for bump and retreat purposes. Therefore, Proposal 11 meets the first <span class="Italic">KANG </span>requirement for being an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, regarding the second requirement, we find that the proposed arrangement is not sufficiently tailored. The Union has not explained and the record does not show how postponing a RIF until VRA employees are converted into the competitive service would lessen the effect of the RIF on more senior competitive service employees. The Authority has held that when a union fails to show how a proposal ameliorates adverse effects, it is not an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Nat'l VA Council 53</span>, 58 FLRA 8, 10 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 352 F.3d 433 (D.C. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, nothing in the record indicates that converted VRA employees would necessarily have lower retention standings than senior competitive service employees. As noted by the Agency, there are four factors to be considered when placing employees in retention registers. These factors are: tenure group, veterans' preference, length of service, and performance. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.501 &#x0026; 351.502. Under RIF regulations, it is possible that a VRA employee serving a two year probationary period could rank higher than some senior employees in the competitive service once all the retention factors are considered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as the Union has not shown how senior competitive service employees would benefit from including VRA employees in a RIF, Proposal 11 is not sufficiently tailored and therefore fails to qualify as an arrangement. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Nat'l VA Council 53</span>, 58 FLRA at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ii.&#x2003;Proposal 11's claimed arrangement is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, Proposal 11 excessively interferes with management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute. As we have indicated with regard to Proposal 10, the Authority determines whether a proposal excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right by weighing the benefits afforded employees under the proposed arrangement against the burden on the exercise of the right. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, </span>59 FLRA at 981.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 11 would have uncertain benefits for unit employees.&#x2003;First, assuming that Proposal 11 intends to provide senior employees with more positions into which they can bump and retreat, as noted earlier, nothing in the record indicates that the converted VRA employees would necessarily have lower retention standings once all retention factors are considered. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.501 &#x0026; 351.502. Second, even assuming that Proposal 11 ameliorated an adverse effect on unit employee by giving some senior competitive service employees more positions for bump and retreat purposes, this benefit would be offset by the proposal's adverse effect on other employees who, because of the proposal, would be displaced in the bump and retreat process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the burden on management's rights, Proposal 11 could delay a RIF for up to two years, until all VRA employees are converted to the competitive service. Such a delay is incompatible with the purposes for which agencies conduct RIFs. These purposes include to compensate for a lack of work or a shortage of funds <span class="Italic">See IFPTE, AFL-CIO, NASA Headquarters Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 8 FLRA 212, 213 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the burdens and benefits, we find that Proposal 11 excessively interferes with management's rights. The proposal's burden on management's rights, effectively preventing a timely agency response to the types of exigencies that lead to RIFs, outweighs the proposal's uncertain benefit to unit employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. </span>(<span class="Italic">MEBA/NMU</span>), 46 FLRA 49, 54-56 (1992) (finding that a proposal requiring the agency to delay for 180 days a decision to terminate services for which there was insufficient demand excessively interfered with management's rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because Proposal 11 does not constitute an arrangement, and because it excessively interferes with the Agency's rights, we conclude that Proposal 11 is not an appropriate arrangement and is outside the duty to bargain as contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
