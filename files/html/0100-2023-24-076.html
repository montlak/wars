<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-72"><span class="space">c.</span> Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee asserting discrimination may proceed through the agency EEO process to district court, or to the Board and then to the EEOC or to court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wells v. Shalala</span>, 228 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (10th Cir. 2000) (constructive discharge case). In a Board appeal involving allegations of discrimination, including disability discrimination, judicial review of the final Board order lies in the district courts. These courts may also review allegations of improper determinations concerning civil service laws and regulations; in a mixed case, appeal does not lie directly in a court of appeals. 5 USC 7703(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. USPS</span>, 653 F.2d 219 (5th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Whitehead v. MSPB</span> (6th Cir. 1981 NP No. 79-3614). There is a split in the circuits as to whether an EEO mixed-case taken to district court without being addressed by MSPB can carry with it a whistleblower claim related to the personnel action otherwise properly taken to court. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Wells v. Shalala</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Bee v. McDonough</span>, ___F. Supp.3d___ (N.D.WV 2022) (it can), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Jewell</span>, 836 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2016) (it cannot (and containing an extensive discussion of the mixed-case process)). The mixed case review process is described in some detail in <span class="Italic">Washington v. Garrett</span>, 10 F.3d 1421, 1428 (9th Cir. 1993). Counsel undertaking district court litigation of a federal employee's EEO case must consider the merits of the case. A frivolous case may result in sanctions against both the employee and counsel. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jackson-Colley v. Dept. of Army Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 655 F. Supp. 122 (E.D. Mich. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of the necessity for exhaustion of administrative remedies before seeking judicial review in cases involving EEO allegations is quite complex and <span id="Page_5275"></span>the subject is left to treatises devoted to EEO litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bankston v. White</span>, 345 F.3d 768 (9th Cir. 2003) (extensive analysis of the jurisdiction of the district court over an ADEA claim by a federal employee who initiated and then voluntarily terminated an MSPB appeal so that he could pursue his case in court). Comments here are not meant as an encompassing discussion of exhaustion of administrative remedies in EEO litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declared that "until the discrimination issue and the appealable action have been decided on the merits by the MSPB, an appellant is granted no rights to a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> in a civil action under &#x00A7; 7702 or &#x00A7; 7703." <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. MSPB</span>, 738 F.2d 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (not addressing an approach to district court through the EEOC following an MSPB decision). However, in <span class="Italic">Ikossi v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 516 F.3d 1037 (D.C. Cir. 2008), the court, reviewing decisions from other circuits, determined that if the appellant before the Board takes a mixed case into district court before obtaining a merits decision from the Board, the district court has jurisdiction over both the EEO and civil service issues. The court in <span class="Italic">Ikossi</span> recognized that the civil service issues would be before the district court without an MSPB administrative record to review. The <span class="Italic">Ikossi</span> court was not too clear on how the civil service claims were to be adjudicated, if at all by the district court, on remand; there seemed to be the possibility that adjudication of the civil service claims, with the possibility of some ongoing involvement by the MSPB, might be stayed pending resolution of the EEO claims. If an appellant properly takes a mixed case to district court, but raises a civil service claim for the first time in district court, the claim is subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schneider v. England</span>, 40 Fed. Appx. 575, 576 (9th Cir. 2002 NP) (whistleblower claim brought for first time in district court dismissed). <span class="Italic">Brown v. Snow</span>, 440 F.3d 1259 (11th Cir. 2006), discusses the complex issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies when EEO appellate procedures are timely invoked but not entirely completed prior to the initiation of a lawsuit in district court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One court determined that the employee may not start with the MSPB, prematurely file another, similar case through the EEO process, and then seek to move to court from the EEO channel, <span class="Italic">Stoll v. Principi</span>, 449 F.3d 263, 264-67 (1st Cir. 2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff-appellant Josephine Stoll worked in the human resources office of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Juan, Puerto Rico from 1987 until the termination of her employment on September 28, 2001. The appellant alleges that the controlling agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.), created a hostile work environment and unlawfully discharged her based on her age (fifty-nine) and her deteriorating health. She also alleges that the V.A.'s stated justification for her ouster--an accumulation of warnings and admonishments related to workplace attendance and leave policies--resulted directly from arbitrary harassment by her supervisors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, the appellant chose to challenge her discharge before the Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22. In this administrative appeal, filed on October 10, 2001, she charged that discriminatory motives had prompted her firing.[1] After she had asked to postpone an upcoming hearing due to her failing health, the Board dismissed her administrative appeal without prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In such circumstances, an appeal filed with the Board is termed a "mixed case," that is, an appeal alleging that "an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap, or age." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 10, 2002, the appellant refiled her administrative appeal. This time it went forward and, four months later, the Board affirmed the V.A.'s decision to terminate her employment. <span class="Italic">See Stoll-Roche v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> No. NY-0752-02-0028-I-2 (M.S.P.B. June 12, 2002). The Board thereafter denied the appellant's subsequent petition for further review. <span class="Italic">See Stoll-Roche v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 486 (2003) (table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While these proceedings were ongoing, the appellant contacted a V.A. equal employment opportunity (EEO) counselor. She filed a formal EEO complaint with the agency on May 2, 2002. The agency dismissed the complaint. Undaunted, the appellant sought review of that decision before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the Commission). The Commission affirmed the dismissal on the ground that the appellant had a proceeding pending before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Stoll-Roche v. Principi,</span> E.E.O.C. Appeal No. 01A23304 (Oct. 11, 2002) (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a)(4)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next commenced an action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. She named a gaggle of defendants, including the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (the Secretary). Her amended complaint raised a gallimaufry of claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e to 2000e-17, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 621-634, section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791, and local law, <span class="Italic">see</span> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 146, 185a. The Secretary moved to dismiss the action on divers grounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). The court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b), who concluded, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that federal law preempted the local law claims; that Title VII did not cover the charges of age and disability discrimination; and that the ADEA and Rehabilitation Act claims ought to be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <span class="Italic">See Stoll v. Principi,</span> No. 02-2761, slip op. at 8-14 (D.P.R. Feb. 1, 2005) (unpublished). On that basis, the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the entire action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the basics. A federal employee who claims to have been cashiered for discriminatory reasons typically may challenge that adverse employment action along either of two routes. For one thing, she may appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.151. Alternatively, she may lodge an EEO complaint with her agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.103(a). An aggrieved employee (or, as in this case, an aggrieved former employee) has a choice between these two options--but she may not avail herself of both. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) (recognizing that once a formal appeal or complaint is filed in either forum, it "shall be considered an election to proceed in that forum"); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Castro v. United States</span>, 775 F.2d 399, 404 &#x0026; n.5 (1st Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). The lodging of either a formal appeal with the Board or a formal complaint with the agency demarcates the point of no return. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b). From that point forward, the complainant must exhaust her claim in the chosen forum. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Economou v. Caldera</span>, 286 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding that a federal employee who had first filed a formal appeal with the Board was required to exhaust his administrative remedies in that forum and could not move at will to the other track).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission's regulations highlight the mutually exclusive nature of the two fora. They provide explicitly that "the agency shall dismiss an entire complaint...[w]here the complainant has raised the matter...in an appeal to the [Board]." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.107(a). The Commission dismissed the appellant's complaint on precisely that ground.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To be sure, the two remedial paths do reach a crossroads. Upon the Board's issuance of a final decision, the appellant could have petitioned the Commission to review that decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(1) (providing for Commission review of certain Board decisions); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.161; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.303(a). Here, however, the appellant never pursued this possibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This election of remedies doctrine is dispositive here. The appellant initially filed an appeal with the Board on October 10, 2001, and refiled it on February 10, 2002. By pressing that appeal, she made an election of remedies. Thus, when she subsequently attempted to switch horses in mid-stream and filed a formal EEO complaint with the agency on May 2, 2002--during the pendency of her appeal before the Board--that filing was a nullity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To say more would be to paint the lily. With two remedial paths open to her, the appellant chose to test the legitimacy of her termination by filing a formal appeal with the Board. The proceedings before the Board <span id="Page_5276"></span>were in full flower when she reversed direction and submitted a formal EEO complaint. Having elected to travel one path (before the Board), she forfeited her right simultaneously to explore the alternative path (before the Commission).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, the Board process that the appellant elected to pursue did not exclude her from all access to the courts. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.120 (providing for review of final Board decisions in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit). Moreover, this is a mixed case, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 1, so the appellant, qua complainant, could have filed a civil action in an appropriate federal district court within thirty days after receiving the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.175. In either event, however, the complainant must wait until the Board takes final action before seeking judicial review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.157, 1201.161(b). The appellant jumped the gun and, thus, cannot fit her action into this integument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reason for the appellant's premature commencement of an action in the district court seems readily evident. She apparently envisioned her suit as an attempted extension of the EEO process (the record strongly suggests that conclusion and her brief on appeal confirms it). But as we have pointed out, the EEO forum was not open to her by the time that she belatedly tried to switch to that track. Her action was, therefore, untenable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The short of it is that, once a government employee elects to pursue a mixed case before the Board, she is obliged to follow that route through to completion, to the exclusion of any other remedy that originally might have been available. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Economou</span>, 286 F.3d at 150.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are at least two reasons why this action cannot be salvaged under the judicial review provisions applicable to proceedings before the Board. First, the appellant has proffered no argument along those lines and, therefore, any such claim has been abandoned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Zannino</span>, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that "a litigant has an obligation to spell out [her] arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold [her] peace" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, judicial review of that nature must await a final decision of the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.157, 1201.161(b). In this instance, the appellant commenced her district court action on December 3, 2002--some nine months before the Board issued its final decision.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The so-called ADEA "bypass" provision does not aid the appellant's cause. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Rossiter v. Potter</span>, 357 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 2004), there are certain conditions precedent attached to the use of that mechanism. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 29. There is nothing in the record that indicates the appellant satisfied these conditions, and she does not profess to have done so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The need to exhaust administrative options in EEO claims was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Rice</span>, 983 F.2d 177, 180 (10th Cir. 1993), dismissing a discrimination claim that was not raised before the Board but that was pleaded in court in addition to a retaliation claim raised before MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff asserts that his claim of discrimination was reasonably related to his claim of retaliation and was therefore included in his initial complaint. The district court dismissed the discrimination claim for lack of jurisdiction because Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Plaintiff raised only unlawful retaliation in his initial complaint to the MSPB. He alleged that he was removed because of his prior EEO complaints. He interjected the issue of race discrimination for the first time in his petition for review, claiming that he was removed because of his race.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suit alleging federal employment discrimination. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Orr</span>, 747 F.2d 1352, 1356 (10th Cir. 1984). By failing to raise the race discrimination claim before the ALJ, Plaintiff was precluded from raising it on his petition for review or at the district court level. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Castro v. United States</span>, 775 F.2d 399, 403 (1st Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Meglio v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 758 F.2d 1576, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Plaintiff argues that the issue of race discrimination was reasonably related to the retaliation issue raised on appeal. The two claims are not related, however, because the retaliation claim was based on Plaintiff's prior charges of discrimination, not on the present discrimination claim raised for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ang v. Procter &#x0026; Gamble Co.</span>, 932 F.2d 540, 547 (6th Cir. 1991) (retaliatory conduct in response to prior EEO complaints is distinguishable from retaliatory conduct following the EEO charge at issue). We leave for another day the question of whether the charges would be reasonably related if they arose out of the same incident of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steffen v. Meridian Life Ins. Co.</span>, 859 F.2d 534, 545 (7th Cir. 1988) ("retaliation claim injects an entirely new theory of liability into the case [by] alleging unlawful activity of a much different nature than...discrimination"), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 491 U.S. 907, 109 S.

General Servs. Admin.</span>, 425 U.S. 820, 832, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 1967, 48 L. Ed.2d 402 (1976). The requirements for processing employment discrimination claims are complex and merit careful attention by a claimant. Generally, the employee must seek relief from the Equal Employment Opportunity department of the employing agency, as required by the procedures outlined in Section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-16(c)<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In some cases, federal employees affected by particular adverse employment actions may instead assert their related Title VII claims in connection with an appeal to the MSPB, an independent, quasi-judicial federal administrative agency established to review civil service decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7701. These are considered "mixed cases" and are governed by specific procedures outlined in 5 USC 7702. The statute describes the preconditions for filing a federal lawsuit in mixed cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A comprehensive statutory and regulatory scheme governs the processing of mixed cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7702; 29 CFR 1613.401--1613.421; 5 CFR 1201.151--1201.175. A mixed case may be filed as a complaint with the agency's EEO department or as an appeal to the MSPB, but not both.[4] 5 USC 7702; 29 CFR 1613.403. Either agency is authorized, and required, to address both the discrimination issues and the civil service issues that arise in a mixed case. 5 USC 7702(a). An employee who initially chooses to file an EEO mixed case complaint may, after 120 days have passed without a judicially reviewable action by the agency, appeal the matter to the MSPB, 5 USC 7702(e)(2), and transfer the administrative review to that agency. EEOC regulations provide for the cancellation of a mixed case complaint if such an appeal is timely filed. 29 CFR 405(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[4]&#x2003;If an employee files in both places, the regulations provide rules for determining which forum has been chosen: "[W]hichever is filed first (the EEO complaint or the MSPB appeal) shall be considered an election to proceed in that forum." 29 CFR 1613.403.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has identified specific circumstances under which a federal employee pursuing a mixed case can seek judicial review of an administrative decision or initiate a civil action based on the issues raised in the administrative proceeding. 5 USC 7702. Employees pursuing relief though an EEO mixed case complaint may file a civil discrimination action in federal district court within 30 days of a final decision by the agency or after 120 days have passed without a decision, but only if no appeal to the MSPB is pursued at that time. 5 USC 7702(e)(1)(A); 29 CFR <span id="Page_5277"></span>1613.421(g). A civil discrimination action may be filed within 30 days of a final decision by the MSPB if the employee has not petitioned for EEOC review of the decision or after 120 days have passed without a final decision. 5 USC 7702(e)(1)(B), 7703(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, McAdams' action began as a mixed case complaint filed with the EEO department of the DOJ. When she later attempted to appeal her demotion to the MSPB, it dismissed the appeal due to the pending related EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.154(c). After 120 days had passed without an EEO decision, McAdams was authorized to file either a civil action in federal district court or an appeal with the MSPB, but not both. 5 USC 7702(e)(1)(a); 29 CFR 1613.421(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 13, 1992, McAdams elected to refile her MSPB appeal, which transformed her administrative action from an EEO mixed case complaint into an MSPB mixed case appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.154(b)(2). At that point, all issues that McAdams had raised in her EEO complaint were transferred to the MSPB proceeding. Having chosen that option, she was required to exhaust her claims in that forum before filing a civil action. <span class="Italic">See Tolbert v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States</span>, 916 F.2d 245, 248 (5th Cir. 1990). Instead, McAdams abandoned her Title VII claims before the MSPB. She cannot now assert them in a separate civil action. The statutory scheme for mixed cases does not confer federal court jurisdiction over such claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McAdams asserts that this analysis is wrong because she did not pursue a mixed case at the administrative level. She first argues that the issues in her EEO complaints and her MSPB appeals were unrelated and that this action is based on the Title VII claim raised solely in her EEO complaints. This argument is not persuasive because her various administrative filings raised related issues and were treated as a mixed case by both the agency and the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Her EEO complaints raised discrimination issues in connection with her demotion and the Bureau's ongoing investigation. Her first complaint was treated as a mixed case by the MSPB, when it dismissed her first appeal because it related to issues in the pending EEO complaint, and by the agency, when it cancelled her complaint in favor of the MSPB proceedings. Her second EEO complaint should have been similarly treated. McAdams' demotion and removal appeals to the MSPB included allegations of sex discrimination and reprisal. She attached a copy of her EEO complaint to her demotion appeal. Her removal appeal also included attachments related to charges of discrimination. Moreover, her complaint in this action lists her demotion and removal as examples of the discriminatory actions taken against her. The record supports the district court's conclusion that the allegations made in McAdams' EEO complaints and MSPB appeals were related and properly the basis of mixed case review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McAdams also asserts that she could not have pursued a mixed case at the administrative level because the MSPB could not have exercised jurisdiction over her hostile work environment claim. The MSPB's jurisdiction is limited to the review of specific appealable actions. 5 USC 1201. In mixed cases, however, the board is authorized and required to decide both the discrimination issue and the appealable action. 5 USC 7702(a)(1). The MSPB does not have jurisdiction over claims of discrimination that are completely divorced from a personnel action otherwise within its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Lazarski v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 475 (1993). If an appealable action is within the board's jurisdiction, however, it may resolve a claim of discrimination made in connection with the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 293 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McAdams appealed her demotion and removal, both of which are appealable actions, to the MSPB. She alleged a variety of objections to the actions, the ongoing Bureau investigation, and the alleged reprisals against her for filing the EEO complaints. Her EEO complaints and the Title VII claims in this case raised similar issues arising out of overlapping facts. In this case the hostile work environment claim is related to, and nearly dependent on, two appealable actions. For this reason, the MSPB was authorized to assert jurisdiction over the discrimination claims asserted in the EEO complaints and in this lawsuit. McAdams' abandonment of the claims before the board prevent her from raising them here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McAdams also asserts that the district court had jurisdiction over her Title VII claims regardless of whether her administrative appeal was a mixed case. She argues that a federal employee can pursue Title VII remedies separate from a related MSPB action. As discussed above, this is contrary to the statutory scheme. Moreover, the cases she relies on in support are simply not on point. <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Runyon</span>, 37 F.3d 1338 (8th Cir. 1994), and <span class="Italic">Washington v. Garrett</span>, 10 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir. 1993), both involved civil actions based on mixed cases that had been properly exhausted. <span class="Italic">Katz v. Dole</span>, 709 F.2d 251 (4th Cir. 1983), involved a separate Title VII complaint and MSPB appeal, but the separate proceedings were based on completely unrelated incidents.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As <span class="Italic">McAdams</span> suggests, care must be taken if a case involving an affirmative defense is initiated with MSPB and the appellant then seeks to have the case considered by EEOC or a district court before the MSPB review process has been completed. If an MSPB appeal is undertaken with an affirmative defense, and if the appeal is then withdrawn and the appellant attempts to pursue the EEO claim through the EEOC process and then into district court, the court may determine that the case cannot receive judicial treatment on the merits for failure to exhaust the MSPB appellate process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Economou v. Caldera</span>, 286 F.3d 144, 149-50 (2d Cir. 2002). <span class="Italic">Economou</span> suggests that exhaustion of administrative remedies is complex, and made more complex by the multiple venues available in EEO cases. The matter of timeliness of district court litigation presenting EEO claims first presented administratively is complex. For mixed cases starting in the EEO process and then elevated to district court without MSPB involvement, <span class="Italic">Bonds v. Leavitt</span>, 629 F.3d 369, 378-80 (4th Cir. 2011), discusses the ability of district courts to adjudicate CSRA claims (including whistleblower reprisal) joined with EEO claims. Thorough research is required on the topic of exhaustion before a particular forum and process, once selected, is prematurely terminated in favor of another forum.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that the action in district court is timely, the court may still require further exhaustion of administrative remedies. For example, a complaint in district court was essentially that the agency did not abide by the Board's final decision in a the case involving a back pay dispute. The district court stayed its adjudication of the case pending the plaintiff's pursuit of an enforcement petition with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. West</span>, 164 F.3d 634 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Gollis v. Garrett</span>, 819 F. Supp. 446, 450 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (back pay issues raised in district court as a mixed case: "[t]hus, even though jurisdiction is proper, judicial economy persuades this Court that it is proper to stay this action while giving the plaintiff an opportunity to pursue an enforcement action with the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The plaintiff in district court has an obligation to pursue with good faith an EEO issue before the Board, or the exhaustion requirement will not be met. But the plaintiff need not prevail on his EEO claims to maintain the "mixed" character of his case for prosecution before a federal district court. The court will consider whether the employee presented testimony and other evidence on the EEO case and argued his theories of discrimination to the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coffman v. Glickman</span>, 328 F.3d 619, 625 (10th Cir. 2003). If the employee raised discrimination in a Board appeal and then received a favorable final decision that was not further appealed, a district court will not review an EEO claim arising from an enforcement petition relating to the earlier Board final decision if discrimination was not alleged in the enforcement petition or PFR to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 375 Fed. Appx. 371, 373 (5th Cir. 2010 NP). [Refer in this chapter to "Mixed Case," as to exhaustion requirements when judicial review is sought of arbitrators' decisions involving EEO issues]</p>
