<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-110"><span class="space">d.</span> Information Provided to the Deciding Official Before the Reply Process Begins</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The due process defenses ordinarily involve information conveyed to, or obtained by, the deciding official after the proposal is issued and during the reply or decision phase. The same considerations, and restrictions, apply to material information conveyed to the deciding official, without the employee's knowledge, before the reply process is underway. <span class="Italic">Fed. Educ. Ass'n v. DOD</span>, 841 F.3d 1362, 1367-70 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Judge Plager dissenting) (decision vacated, <span class="Italic">en banc</span> consideration ordered, <span class="Italic">Fed. Educ. Ass'n v. DOD</span>, 873 F.3d 903 (2017), <span class="Italic">vacated, review petition dismissed as untimely</span>, <span class="Italic">Fed. Educ. Ass'n, Karen Graviss, Petitioners v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180806094">898 F.3d 1222</a> (Fed. Cir. 2018) (Judge Plager dissenting) (reh. <span class="Italic">en banc</span> den., 909 F.3d 1141 (Fed. Cir. 2018)), came to the court from an arbitration decision. A preschool teacher was investigated by the school principal for inappropriate restraint of a disabled child. The principal forwarded an incident report to the next level supervisor, a community superintendent, who would later serve as the deciding official, and to the third level supervisor, a district superintendent. The district superintendent sent an email to the community superintendent and to the principal stating that they needed to try and terminate the teacher. Then the principal issued a removal proposal and the teacher replied to the community superintendent, who issued a removal decision. The teacher did not know of the involvement and statement of the district superintendent. That communication was discovered as the case later headed to arbitration. The Federal Circuit determined that the communication was <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>, material, and violated due process protections. Although the decision was vacated because it was later determined that the judicial review petition was untimely, the message conveyed deserves attention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government first argues that the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors do not apply at all here because the communication occurred before removal proceedings had been brought against Ms. Graviss. The government contends that improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications can only occur once the removal proceeding had actually begun--in this case, when the notice of proposed removal had been issued. To be sure, as we discuss below, not all <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications before the initiation of a proceeding will violate due process. But we see no basis for a distinction between pre- and post-initiation communications when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication occurred at a time, as is the case here, when an adjudicatory proceeding was contemplated. The risk of creating undue pressure in such circumstances is just as great when <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact occurs before the proceeding begins as when it occurs after the proceeding begins.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is clear that a proceeding was contemplated; indeed, that was the very purpose of the email, and it does not matter for the purposes of constitutional due process whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication occurred before or after formal proceedings had been initiated. Notably, under the Administrative Procedure Act, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in the formal adjudication context are prohibited when "the person responsible for the communication has knowledge [the proceeding] will be noticed." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 557(d)(1)(E).[3] The Board itself follows this rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.102 (prohibiting <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications "from the time the persons involved know that the Board may consider the matter until the time the Board has issued a final decision"). Accordingly, we proceed to consider the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 557(d)(1)(A), (E) (prohibiting "an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding" and providing that "the prohibitions of this subsection shall apply beginning at such time as the agency may designate, but in no case shall they begin to apply later than the time at which a proceeding is noticed for hearing unless the person responsible for the communication has knowledge that it will be noticed, in which case the prohibitions shall apply beginning at the time of his acquisition of such knowledge").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication "introduces 'cumulative' information or new information." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. While the government echoes the arbitrator's conclusion that "the email...was not 'new and material evidence,'" it does not argue that the March 26 email was merely "'cumulative' information" under the first factor. Nor could it. The March 26 email clearly introduced new information to Mr. Curkendall, the deciding official, because it informed him for the first time that his supervisor, Dr. Calvano, wanted Ms. Graviss to be removed for "insubordination" and "repeated use of corpor[a]l punishment." That information, along with Dr. McClain's ready agreement, was not "cumulative" of any other information received by Mr. Curkendall. The first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor was satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the second factor, whether "the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it," <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377, the government does not dispute that Ms. Graviss only learned about the March 26 email during discovery leading up to arbitration, long after her opportunity to respond to the proposed termination had closed, the termination decision was made, and she was removed from her position. Accordingly, the second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor was satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent concedes that "[u]ndoubtedly, it would have been preferable had the issue been fully aired at the initial stages of the administrative review, for whatever relevance to the merits it may have had." But the dissent suggests that any unfairness resulting from Ms. Graviss's lack of knowledge of the March 26 email prior to her termination was mitigated later when she was given the opportunity to address the email during <span id="Page_3288"></span>arbitration. That opportunity to address the email occurred four years after her termination when the email was finally disclosed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that, as the Supreme Court recognized in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, there are "<span class="Italic">some</span> situations in which a post-deprivation hearing will satisfy due process requirements." 470 U.S. at 542 n.7 (emphasis added). But this does not mean that an employee enjoys no due process before removal. Our recognition of the importance of pretermination due process dates back at least to our holding in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 179 F.3d at 1376 ("An employee is entitled to a certain amount of due process rights at each stage and, when these rights are undermined, the employee is entitled to relief regardless of the stage of the proceedings."); <span class="Italic">see also Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1282 ("If the Board finds that the communications did introduce new and material information in violation of [Petitioner's] due process rights, [Petitioner] must be afforded a constitutionally correct removal procedure." (internal quotation marks omitted)). Recently, this court has squarely rejected the idea that an adequate post-termination review can cure a procedurally deficient termination proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Young</span>, 706 F.3d at 1377 ("[Petitioner] was entitled to procedural fairness at each stage of the removal proceedings, not just upon review of the termination decision." (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the third factor, whether the communications were "of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner," <span class="Italic">id</span>., Ms. Graviss argues that the March 26 email from a supervisor to a subordinate deciding official is a paradigmatic example of "the type" of communication "likely to result in undue pressure." The government disagrees on this point, contending that "Dr. Calvano's informal opinions are just that: informal opinions. They do not direct, officially recommend, or even pressure an outcome." The government emphasizes the arbitrator's finding that the decision-maker here was subjectively independent, arguing that such subjective independence forecloses any due process violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true, as the government contends, that the arbitrator concluded that the "full record shows Curkendall was the independent decider required under case law," based on the testimony from Mr. Curkendall and Dr. Calvano that no undue influence had been intended or perceived. And it is true that no such finding had been made in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, where we remanded to the MSPB for a consideration of the three factors in the first instance. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. But whether or not the decisionmaker was subjectively independent is not the question. Rather, the fundamental issue is whether there was a substantial potential for undue pressure using the objective standard of <span class="Italic">Stone</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, whether the communications were "<span class="Italic">of the type likely</span> to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner," <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377 (emphasis added), specifically directs the inquiry to the "type" of communication involved, and does not require proof that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication actually resulted in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. Indeed, we held in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> that "[u]ltimately, the inquiry...is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and <span class="Italic">so likely to cause prejudice</span> that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). While proof of subjective undue influence from an undisclosed communication may support a conclusion that there has been a due process violation, the absence of subjective influence does not foreclose the possibility of a violation. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. Accordingly, the arbitrator's finding that Mr. Curkendall in fact believed that he was not unduly influenced by the March 26 email does not preclude a due process violation. We conclude that a petitioner need not prove actual subjective influence in order to demonstrate a violation of due process under <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. <span class="Italic">See also Camero v. United States</span>, 375 F.2d 777, 780 (Ct. Cl. 1967) (invalidating removal despite concluding that the deciding official "made up his own mind when he decided to sustain plaintiff's removal" because "decisions were made, at least in part, on the basis of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the March 26 email was certainly the "<span class="Italic">type</span>" of communication "likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner" under the objective framework of the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377 (emphasis added). A supervisor issued what can only most generously be deemed a "suggestion" to a subordinate decision-maker. The nature of this communication, particularly in light of the strong language used, "<span class="Italic">we need to try and terminate her</span>...," and the specificity of the suggested rationale, "<span class="Italic">for repeated use of corporeal</span> [sic] <span class="Italic">punishment and for insubordination</span>," creates a high risk that a subordinate decision-maker would have been unduly pressured to terminate the employee. Because the undisclosed March 26 email was of the type likely to result in undue pressure, the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor was satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be clear, we are not suggesting that the standards of impartiality applicable to the judiciary and to Board adjudication also apply in the context of an agency decision to remove an employee or other adverse action.[4] Inevitably, due to the nature of the workplace, a deciding official in the employment context likely is familiar with the employee and has knowledge of the employee's prior performance and conduct. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, we recognize that the existence of such knowledge by officials involved with the removal process (including the deciding official) creates no due process issue, as we held in <span class="Italic">Norris v. SEC</span>, 675 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, we affirmed an arbitrator's finding that an alleged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication was not new and material where the alleged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication was merely the deciding official's awareness of a prior incident of the employee's misconduct at the time of her removal decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1353-54. As we explained, "a deciding official's mere knowledge of prior misconduct by the employee obtained before the commencement of disciplinary proceedings does not constitute an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Other circuits have rejected such arguments where an impartial decision maker presides over posttermination proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McDaniels v. Flick</span>, 59 F.3d 446, 459-60 (3d Cir. 1995) (collecting cases); <span class="Italic">Walker v. City of Berkeley</span>, 951 F.2d 182, 184 (9th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Duchesne v. Williams</span>, 849 F.2d 1004, 1005, 1008 (6th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But unlike <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, this case does not involve routine communications and knowledge acquired about an employee's job performance before a decision to commence removal proceedings. Rather, the communication in this case was directed to the conduct of the removal proceedings and is indistinguishable from the type of communication that this court recognized violated due process in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. All three of the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors are satisfied. First, the communication was made in contemplation of removal proceedings and provided the new information that the official's supervisor wanted Ms. Graviss to be terminated. Second, Ms. Graviss was unaware of this communication and, therefore, she had no opportunity to respond to it. Third, the recommendation of termination by the deciding official's supervisor was "of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner," in this case, to terminate Ms. Graviss. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that Ms. Graviss's due process rights were violated, and that substantial evidence does not support the arbitrator's conclusion to the contrary. We need not consider Ms. Graviss's other arguments regarding the merits of her removal. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
