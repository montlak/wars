<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-27"><span class="space">a.</span> Clerical Employee, Secretary</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Subjective standards were inappropriate for a GS-4 Secretary whose duties involved fairly specific, easily identifiable tasks, unlike the professional position in <span class="Italic">Shuman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 620, 626 (1984), said to encompass a broad scope of duties that varied in complexity and significance. <span class="Italic">Denton v. IRS</span>, 29 MSPR 49, 49 n.* (1985). For a GS-3 Secretary, adequate standards included the number of typing assignments to be completed by the due date, the allowable words-per-minute that must be typed, and the number of permissible errors per page. <span class="Italic">Chennault v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 122, 125 (1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 217, 220 (1986) (improperly defined standards for a GS-7 Secretary). A typist was properly evaluated by averaging typing output over an extended period. <span class="Italic">Adkins v. DHUD</span>, 781 F.2d 891 (Fed. Cir. 1986). <span class="Italic">Adkins</span> permitted subjective measurement of typing skills for the GS-3 appellant: the supervisor was within his rights, after counseling the appellant, to determine the number of days the typing would be required to meet the average output standard to exceed the unsatisfactory performance level. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 605, 608 (1987), determined that an AJ erred by failing to distinguish between the number of errors on original documents rather than permissible corrections to errors on file copies or carbon copies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Melnick v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 93, 96 n.1 (1989), a secretary's critical element required the performance of "special tasks," measured by the standard at the fully successful level:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Non-routine special tasks are carried out accurately, professionally and timely. Results are well thought out, displayed and presented, with minimum input from the immediate supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Time and Attendance Reports are completed in accordance with the Timekeeper's Handbook and submitted on time. These reports are always legible and an accuracy rate of at least 90 percent is maintained. Time and Attendance Reports are filed and properly updated within two weeks of receipt.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The standard was acceptable, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 99:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for the appellant here to demonstrate successful performance under the non-routine special tasks component of Critical Element No. 6, she was required to perform non-routine tasks "accurately, professionally and timely," and to obtain results that were "well thought out, displayed and presented." "Non-routine special tasks" are, by definition, <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> assignments that vary widely in nature and that occur on an intermittent basis, along with the appellant's regularly-scheduled and anticipated job duties. Extreme specificity in the written performance standard relating to such special, non-routine assignments therefore cannot be expected, and is unnecessary <span class="Italic">so long as</span> the agency provides the appellant with additional, specific information about her job requirements adequate to apprise the appellant of what is expected of her. <span class="Italic">See Donaldson,</span> 27 MSPR at 298.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency communicated what was required of the appellant both prior to and during the PIP. Indeed, as the administrative judge noted, "the agency clearly reminded the appellant of four specific special tasks which remained incomplete at the outset of the performance improvement period...." Accordingly, because the agency provided the appellant with a detailed description of the standards against which she was being measured, and because it was not unreasonable for the agency to expect completion of the assigned tasks by the end of the PIP,[3] we find that the performance standard relating to special tasks met the statutory requirements for validity under 5 USC &#x00A7; 4302. <span class="Italic">See Wilson,</span> 770 F.2d at 1055-56.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The "special tasks" slated for completion by the appellant during the PIP consisted of setting-up office files, organizing her work area, hole-punching program files, and providing her <span id="Page_2903"></span>supervisor with a daily list of work accomplishments. We find that the thirty days provided to the appellant for the completion of these tasks was more than adequate given their relatively simple nature.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Towne v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Towne v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 120 MSPR 239, 243, 252-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 23, 25-32, 2013 MSPB 81 (2013), concluded that a GS-5 secretary's performance was deficient:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Effective May 9, 2011, the agency removed the appellant from her position based on her unacceptable performance in five out of six "Duties" (i.e. critical elements) of her "Core Document" (i.e., performance standards). Specifically, the agency asserted that the appellant's performance was unacceptable in the following critical elements: (1) prepares a wide variety of recurring and some nonrecurring correspondence, reports, and other documents and reviews and finalizes correspondence/documents prepared by others in handwritten or electronic drafts; (2) reviews and processes incoming and outgoing correspondence, materials, publications, regulations, and directives; (3) maintains supervisor's calendar, coordinates meeting arrangements, and schedules meetings and/or conferences; (4) performs other clerical and administrative work in support of the office/organization; and (5) uses varied and advance functions of word processing software to create, format, modify, edit, and print various documents....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...For example, under the first critical element, the appellant's performance standard provided: "Documents are routinely finalized in a timely manner, meeting prescribed suspense dates or established deadlines." The agency fleshed out this standard in the PIP notice as follows: "Accurately finalize and route documents by established suspense dates of 5 days following meetings for draft minutes and and [sic] 10 days prior to meeting [sic] for agendas." Another example appears under critical element 4: "Typically maintains calendar efficiently and promptly informs supervisor of any changes or conflicts." In the PIP notice, the agency fleshed out this standard thusly:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Schedule appointments and meetings without prior approval in accordance with supervisor's policies and priorities, and coordinate with supervisor as necessary. This includes all newly assigned nurses and nuses [sic] scheduled for career counseling. Inform supervisor of conflicts and reschedules appointments when it is clear that the supervisor will not be able to make all commitments. If a supervisor can't attend a scheduled meeting, contact an alternate person when necessary. No more than one incorrect entry will be acceptable per week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we do not explicitly address each relevant standard here, we have carefully reviewed them and find that they are all substantially similar to the examples mentioned here, requiring the same analysis and leading to the same conclusion. We find that the agency has shown by substantial evidence that the appellant's performance standards are reasonable, realistic, attainable, reasonably objective, and tailored to the specific requirements of the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 13, &#x00B6; 13 (2004); <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6; 12. Thus, the agency has met its burden of proving by substantial evidence that the appellant's performance standards are valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As mentioned previously, the agency maintained that the appellant's performance was unacceptable under the critical element of her position that required her to prepare a wide variety of recurring and some nonrecurring correspondence, reports, and other documents and reviews and finalize correspondence/document prepared by others in handwritten or electronic drafts. Specifically, in support of its allegation of unacceptable performance under this critical element, the agency pointed to deficiencies in the appellant's preparation of documents related to the December 2010 and January 2011 Nursing Executive Council meetings. The record supports the claim that the appellant's documents contained numerous grammatical, spelling, and formatting errors, the appellant neglected to delete information from the prior meeting's minutes in several places, failed to attach numerous attachments, and made several errors regarding attendance at the meetings. In addition, the agency noted and the record shows that the appellant failed to timely prepare minutes and the agenda for the meetings described above and other meetings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also alleged that the appellant's performance was unacceptable under the critical element of her position that required her to review and process incoming and outgoing correspondence, materials, publications, regulations, and directives. The record supports the agency's claim that the appellant failed to maintain her email account with the result that her inbox became full and some messages were returned to the sender. The record also shows that the appellant failed to check for electronic correspondence on a daily basis as required, she failed to process outgoing mail timely, and she did not update the office's electronic suspense tracker.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the agency also alleged that the appellant failed to maintain her supervisor's calendar, coordinate meeting arrangements, and schedule meetings and/or conferences as required by a critical element of her performance standards. In support of its allegations of unacceptable performance under this critical element, the agency pointed to and the record supports the appellant's failure to accurately keep the office Career Counseling Tracker up to date and to schedule initial and annual career counseling so that Col. McDaniels could provide subordinate military officers with counseling in a timely manner. Further, the appellant scheduled a meeting for Col. McDaniels with a Lieutenant Appleton and when Col. McDaniels attempted to prepare for that meeting, she discovered that there was no such person in the command; the appellant should have indicated that the meeting was with a Lieutenant Stapleton.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the performance deficiencies set forth above, the agency alleged that the appellant's performance was unacceptable in the critical element of her position that required her to perform other clerical and administrative work in support of the office/organization. Among other things, the agency alleged and the record shows that the appellant failed to maintain and update office file systems and failed to maintain an email address list of all nurses within the medical group. The appellant also failed to keep outside employment files current.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency alleged that the appellant's performance was unacceptable in the critical element of her position that required her to use varied and advance functions of word processing software to create, format, modify, edit, and print various documents. To demonstrate the appellant's unacceptable performance under the critical element, the agency pointed to various performance deficiencies set forth above involving word processing and the appellant's failure to incorporate edits into the MDGI in approximately two months, even though the assignment required only about a half-day of simple typing and basic word processing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant provided a number of explanations for her errors. For example, she alleged that she had difficulty finding uninterrupted time to do her work because she constantly had to deal with visitors to the suite, who naturally gravitated towards her as she was the closest to the door. The agency offered to move her work station to somewhere quieter, however, but the appellant declined to move. To the extent the appellant asserted that she missed deadlines because she was on leave, we note that the agency only counted days which the appellant was present in calculating deadlines, and all of the above discussions of untimely work product account for the appellant's leave. We have already discussed above the appellant's claim that she had difficulty completing the MGDI because she deleted the email containing Col. McDaniels' instructions and the edits she was supposed to incorporate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted that she did not have unlimited storage space associated with her email account and did not spend time on her return from leave reviewing the email that had accumulated in her inbox because she gave a higher priority to other tasks. However, the record reflects that the appellant's electronic inbox was full and rejecting incoming messages on January 19, a full week after the appellant returned from leave. She further asserted that the meeting agendas were kept on a shared drive and were always available to everyone whether she completed them on time or not. Yet an outdated agenda for a meeting that has already taken place is of no value to those who might look for the new agenda on the shared drive so they could prepare for a future meeting. The appellant also testified that Col. McDaniels deleted electronic documents, removed physical files, and inserted errors into the appellant's written work so she could later accuse the appellant of poor performance. We see no evidentiary support for this claim and we reject it as frivolous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the above discussion illustrates, the agency has submitted numerous examples of the appellant's unacceptable performance. We have not, however, relied on all of the agency's allegations regarding the appellant's preparation of meeting minutes. For example, some employees attended these meetings in place of others or in more than one capacity and the appellant was expected to account for this when listing the attendees and the offices which they represented. The appellant was also required <span id="Page_2904"></span>to distinguish between old business, new business, and standard agenda items, and to report them in different sections of the meeting minutes. In other words, the appellant had to have had some basic understanding of the substantive content of the meetings to prepare accurate minutes in accordance with her supervisor's expectations. We find that Col. McDaniels' testimony concerning these matters was confusing and we are not persuaded that the agency met its burden of proof regarding the substantive elements of the meeting minutes. On the other hand, as discussed above the agency has shown unacceptable performance concerning errors in the meeting minutes that were entirely clerical in nature such as those listed above.</p>
