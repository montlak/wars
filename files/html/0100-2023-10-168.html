<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-169"><span class="space">b.</span> Union</h5>
<p class="noindent">Incorrect statements in the campaign literature of one union were insufficient to set aside an election. Enough time remained for the other union adequately to respond to those statements. The literature consisted of campaign puffery about the effectiveness of a union's representation in the past, contrasted with the uncertainty of the rival's future representation. <span class="Italic">Naval Air Rework Facility and NAGE Local R4-84</span>, 12 FLRA 15, 15-16 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Fifth Army, 122nd ARCOM, N. Little Rock, Ark. and NAGE Local R5-158</span>, 36 FLRA 407, 413 (1990) (campaign propaganda was subject to evaluation by electorate and unobjectionable; no need to resolve whether other union had reasonable reply opportunity); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Savanna Army Depot Activity and NFFE and NAGE</span>, 34 FLRA 218, 221 (1990) (no need to resolve whether time allowed for response by one union to another's flyers; statements in flyers were "puffery").</p>
<p class="noindent">Statements that are inaccurate or exaggerated concerning union representational abilities, and incorrect interpretations of negotiated agreements, will not likely serve to overturn an election. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Watervliet Arsenal and NFFE Local 2109</span>, 37 FLRA 1086, 1090 (1990) (Objections 4-6: "Campaign statements which can be reasonably interpreted by employees as mere 'campaign puffery' do not provide a basis for setting aside an election."). According to <span class="Italic">PBGC and Ind. Union of Pension Employees for Democracy &#x0026; Justice</span>, 66 FLRA 349, 352-53 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[L]ong-standing Authority precedent holds that campaign communications subject to employee evaluation, and easily interpreted as campaign propaganda, are not a basis for setting aside an election, even in circumstances where the other union has not had an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Fifth Army, </span>36 FLRA at 413; <span class="Italic">Savanna Army Depot, </span>34 FLRA at 221. Authority precedent also deals with issues where campaign communications with the entire electorate are involved. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., </span>62 FLRA 78 (2007) (mass mailings to voters).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Incumbent's claim that the RD applied case law pertaining to "yesteryears campaign tactics" does not establish that there is an absence of precedent. Although e-mail communications differ technologically from other forms of communication, the Incumbent has failed to explain why this difference gives e-mail communications a different legal character. The Incumbent's failure to cite any legal authority in support of its contention that e-mail communications are legally distinct from other forms of campaign communications reinforces this conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent">A leaflet containing misstatements about an opposing union's ability to control a RIF did not warrant a new election even when it was distributed on the last day of the election campaign, too late for the rival's reply. The RIF issue was hotly debated during the campaign. The leaflet repeated old charges <span id="page_165"></span>and countercharges. It was campaign puffery that employees could evaluate. <span class="Italic">Office of Sec'y, DHHS and NTEU</span>, 14 FLRA 807, 808 (1984). Statements implying that the incumbent union would not be able to prevent a RIF of employees are campaign propaganda susceptible to evaluation by the electorate and unobjectionable when the incumbent has ample time to respond. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq., Ft. Sam Houston and AFGE Local 2154</span>, 12 FLRA 766, 769 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOD Stateside Dependents Sch. and Benning Educ. Ass'n</span>, 48 FLRA 471, 474 (1993) ("[C]ampaign statements which can be reasonably interpreted as 'mere "campaign puffery" which the employees [are] able to evaluate as such' do not provide a basis for setting aside an election....&#8197;Moreover, the Authority has denied review of decision dismissing objections of this nature where the opposing party had ample time to respond to disputed statements.").</p>
<p class="noindent">To be actionable, statements during a campaign must be a substantial departure from the truth and reasonably be expected significantly to affect an election. <span class="Italic">Army Health Care Sys. Support Activity and NFFE Local 28</span>, 16 FLRA 1178, 1180 (1984). A letter by a union official suggesting that employees destroy election petitions circulated by another union was not inherently coercive and, without evidence that any of the petitions were destroyed, there was no finding of interference. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R12-35 and SEIU</span>, 14 FLRA 450, 455-56 (1984) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">A factor to be considered is whether the opposing union had an opportunity to respond to incorrect information disseminated during an election campaign, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, McAlester Army Ammunition Plant and NAIL</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-059.html">61 FLRA 323</a>, 323-25 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The NFFE statements were as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If you vote for NAIL all current contract provisions go away, including the work schedule (4-10s), and the agency will unilaterally decide these issues!</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Choosing NAIL in the upcoming election will guarantee the loss of all negotiated privileges at the Munitions Division, and NAIL can do nothing to protect you from that. In addition, with this division going under Homeland Security, these privileges will be lost forever!</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The RD did not fail to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether objectionable conduct requires that an election be set aside is its potential for interfering with the free choice of the voters.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See United States Army Engineer Activity, Capital Area, Fort Myer, Va.</span>, 34 FLRA 38, 42 (1989). In this regard, campaign statements which can be reasonably interpreted as "mere 'campaign puffery' which the employees [are] able to evaluate as such" do not provide a basis for setting aside an election. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, N.Y.</span>, 37 FLRA 1086, 1088 (1990). Moreover, the Authority has dismissed objections to false statements where the opposing party had ample time to respond to disputed statements. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Defense, Stateside Dependents Schools, Fort Benning Schools, Fort Benning, Ga.</span>, 48 FLRA 471, 474 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Fort Benning Schools</span>); <span class="Italic">Army and Air Force Exch. Serv., Fort Drum Exch. (Fort Drum, N.Y.)</span>, 33 FLRA 245, 248 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Fort Drum</span>); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>, 12 FLRA at 15-16. In this regard, the Authority has found that three days constituted ample time to respond. <span class="Italic">See Fort Drum</span>, 33 FLRA at 246, 248.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD found that the statements contained in the NFFE literature constituted an erroneous assessment of the current state of the law as to what would happen to the employees' established conditions of employment if NFFE were replaced as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit. However, he concluded that six days was a sufficient amount of time for NAIL to reply to the literature. NAIL has not challenged the RD's findings concerning the date the NFFE literature was distributed. Further, NAIL concedes in its application for review that it did respond to the NFFE literature before the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to NAIL's contention that the RD failed to consider the type of misrepresentation contained in the NFFE literature, the Authority, in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>, 12 FLRA at 15-16, found that erroneous statements similar to the statements made in this case did not constitute a basis for setting aside the election because the other union had sufficient time to adequately respond to the statements. Thus, there is no reason to conclude that the type of misrepresentation involved here would otherwise preclude NAIL from making an effective response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As NAIL had six days to respond--and did respond--to the NFFE literature, and as the Authority has held such time to be an ample time to effectively respond in these circumstances, we find that the RD's decision is consistent with Authority precedent. Accordingly, we conclude that the RD did not fail to apply established law in finding that NFFE's distribution of the literature did not constitute conduct that significantly interfered with the free choice of the voters to warrant setting aside the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Established law or policy does not warrant reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL contends that the Authority should reconsider its precedent and hold that an election should be set aside where the prevailing party distributed "blatantly false" literature to eligible voters that is inconsistent with Authority precedent. According to NAIL, only a notice posted by the Authority refuting the statements in dispute could have served as an effective response in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL has failed to provide any support for its claim that there is a need to reconsider Authority precedent.&#x2003;In this regard, NAIL has not demonstrated why it could not effectively respond to claims such as those made here. As noted above, NAIL did respond to the NFFE literature before the election. The current policy ensures that parties who are subject to false statements during an election campaign have a sufficient amount of time to respond and this protection sufficiently forecloses interference with the free choice of the voters. As such, we conclude that reconsideration of the Authority's well-established law and policy on this matter is not warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent">Misstatements by a union that it would provide attorneys to represent nonmembers were not cause to set aside an election. Subsequently, the union correctly stated its position and the opposing union also informed voters of the correct status. <span class="Italic">Office of Sec'y, DHHS and NTEU</span>, 14 FLRA 807, 809 (1984). Another case involving promises of legal representation led to considerable description of the regional director's treatment of objections in <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 38 FLRA 952, 953-56, 962-64 (1990), noting that NTEU's promise to undertake legal action was not limited only to employees who demonstrated preelection support for NTEU:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency filed two objections with the Regional Director (RD), alleging that NTEU had engaged in improper conduct affecting the election. In his Decision and Order on Objections to Election, the RD concluded that no objectionable conduct had occurred that warranted setting aside the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Objection 1</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contended that NTEU engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the election by promising temporary Liquidation Graded (LG) employees in the proposed unit(s), prior to the election, that it would file a class action lawsuit on their behalf to challenge their temporary status if NTEU were successful in the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued, citing <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Savair Manufacturing Company</span>, 414 U.S. 270 (1973) (<span class="Italic">Savair</span>), that NTEU's preelection promise to file a lawsuit if the employees opted for union representation interfered with the employees' free choice in two ways: (1) NTEU's promise to file a lawsuit, like the offer to waive initiation fees in <span class="Italic">Savair</span>, permitted NTEU to create a false impression of employee support by improperly obtaining authorization cards based on its promise; and (2) the employees, like the employees in <span class="Italic">Savair</span>, would feel compelled to vote for NTEU because they had earlier pledged their support by signing authorization cards based upon the improper promise by NTEU.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD noted that "[i]n <span class="Italic">Savair</span>, the Supreme Court proscribed a union's offer to waive initiation fees only for those employees who signed union authorization cards prior to the election because this allowed the union to buy endorsements and paint a portrait of employee support. However, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has consistently held that a union's offer to waive initiation fees during an election campaign is objectionable only if limited to the period prior to the election."...&#8197;The RD noted further that "[o]n June 17, 1988, [the RD] denied [the Agency's] challenge to the adequacy and validity of the showing of interest submitted by NTEU in the subject case, concluding, among other things, that the promise to undertake legal action contained in NTEU's campaign literature did not taint the showing of interest."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that in contrast to the union's conditional offer to waive initiation fees in <span class="Italic">Savair</span>, NTEU's promise to undertake legal action on behalf of certain Agency employees was not limited only to those employees who demonstrated preelection support for NTEU. Rather, NTEU's promise applied to all LG employees irrespective of how they had voted in the election. Thus, finding that the employees had a freedom of choice in the election, the RD distinguished the facts of this case from <span class="Italic">Savair</span>. In support of his finding, the RD cited <span class="Italic">Molded Acoustical Products, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 815 F.2d 934 (3d Cir. 1987) (a union does not endanger employees' freedom of choice if, prior to the representation election, it promises to waive initiation fees for all employees in the bargaining unit regardless of whether the employees signed union recognition slips before the election).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the promise of legal action if NTEU won the election was not tantamount to offering employees a monetary inducement to vote for NTEU.&#x2003;The RD found that the private sector cases relied on by the Agency involve the direct conferring or promise of newly created, non-work related financial benefits to employees immediately prior to the election or as a result of the union winning the election. The RD found those cases distinguishable because the promise to file a lawsuit does not involve a direct or immediate economic inducement or actual payment to employees, but, at most, possibly allows employees to avoid the expense of personally instituting a lawsuit in the future. Further, the RD concluded that the promise to file a lawsuit was not made solely to <span id="page_166"></span>employees joining the union prior to the election and the filing of such a lawsuit is typical of the representational benefits NTEU provides to its members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the RD found that employees would understand that any benefits resulting from a lawsuit filed by NTEU on their behalf are speculative and dependent on contingencies beyond the control of NTEU. For this reason, in the RD's view, the promise to file a lawsuit if the Petitioner won the election is more akin to a permissible preelection promise of a wage increase that employees recognize as being subject to the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the RD overruled objection 1, concluding that NTEU's preelection promise to file a lawsuit if it won the election did not improperly interfere with the employees' freedom of choice in the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Objection 2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contended that NTEU's free legal assistance to five employees constituted objectionable conduct that warrants setting aside the election. Relying on private sector cases, the Agency argued that by granting such benefits to these employees, NTEU impermissibly sought to garner their votes and that, furthermore, other employees were induced to vote for NTEU after learning about NTEU's generosity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner admitted that prior to the election it provided free legal assistance to five employees terminated by the Agency.&#x2003;The five were temporary LG employees whose employment contracts were not renewed. Prior to the election, NTEU appealed the terminations of four of the employees to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The NTEU also filed an EEO complaint before the election on behalf of one of the terminated employees and represented her in that process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the Agency presented no evidence that NTEU conditioned its legal assistance to the terminated employees on their support for NTEU in the election or that prior to the election NTEU publicized its actions to the electorate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD concluded that the legal assistance provided to the terminated employees was not the kind of tangible economic benefit that had been found improper in the cases cited by the Agency.&#x2003;Rather, he concluded that the filing of the MSPB appeals and the EEO complaint on behalf of the terminated employees who actively supported NTEU did not impair a free election. In this regard, he found that: (1) the terminated employees had supported NTEU before their discharges and before they received any legal assistance; (2) there was no evidence that the legal assistance provided was conditioned on a vote in favor of NTEU; and (3) because only one of the five terminated employees voted in the election, that ballot was not sufficient to affect the results of the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the possible influence of NTEU's actions on the other employees, the RD found there was no evidence that NTEU or the terminated employees publicized NTEU's representation of the employees in question during the election campaign. The RD further noted that even assuming the electorate was aware of NTEU's legal assistance prior to the election, the NLRB has determined that similar conduct would not warrant setting aside an election. <span class="Italic">Paolo's Continental Restaurant, Inc.</span>, 213 NLRB 557 (1974).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the RD overruled objection 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that no compelling reasons exist, within the meaning of section 2422.17(c) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations, for granting the Agency's application for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Objection 1</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not demonstrated that the RD's factual findings are clearly erroneous and that such error prejudicially affects its rights. We find the RD's analysis of the issue presented as it relates to the facts to be correct. We agree with the RD that this case is clearly distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Savair</span> and the other cases cited by the Agency. In this regard, it is significant that NTEU's promise to undertake legal action was not limited only to those employees who demonstrated preelection support for NTEU but, rather, applied to all unit employees regardless of how the employees voted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Molded Acoustical Products, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, above. Further, in agreement with the RD, we find that NTEU's promise was not tantamount to offering employees a monetary inducement to vote for NTEU. Although the employees could benefit from the NTEU lawsuit, because the outcome could affect their job status and because NTEU saved them the costs of retaining their own attorneys, we find that this is a commonly recognized benefit of union representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dart Container of California</span>, 277 NLRB 1369 (1985). Therefore, we conclude that NTEU's preelection promise to file a lawsuit if it won the election did not improperly interfere with the employees' freedom of choice in the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Objection 2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not demonstrated that the RD's factual findings concerning this objection are clearly erroneous and that such error prejudicially affects its rights. Without deciding whether NTEU's conduct of providing free legal assistance to five employees could have interfered with voter free choice, we conclude that the conduct did not, in the circumstances in this case, affect the results of, or warrant setting aside, the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency presented no evidence as to the possible influence of NTEU's conduct on other employees. No evidence was presented that NTEU or the terminated employees publicized NTEU's representation of the employees in question during the election campaign. The Agency argues that requiring it to present material evidence on this fact "places too great an onus on [the Agency]."...&#8197;We reject this contention. Section 2422.21(b) of our Rules and Regulations clearly provides that "[t]he Objecting party shall bear the burden of proof at all stages of the proceeding regarding all matters raised in its objections." We note that the Agency was able to provide considerable evidence with regard to NTEU's publicizing of its promise to file a lawsuit if it won the election and became the employees' bargaining representative. Further, as to the Agency's request that a hearing be held on the objection in order to provide it with an opportunity to explore the matter, we find that the decision to hold a hearing is within the RD's discretion.<span class="Italic"> See </span>section 2422.21(g) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations. In reviewing the RD's decision here, we conclude that there was no abuse of that discretion and the decision was correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Only a small number of the eligible voters were directly affected by NTEU's preelection conduct. In our view, the assistance provided to five individuals would not affect the results of a nationwide election in which over 1,800 ballots are cast where there is a lack of evidence that anyone knew of the Petitioner's preelection conduct, and where the margin of victory is substantial. Moreover, of the four unit employees and one supervisor directly affected by the Petitioner's conduct, only one voted subject to challenge and it is clear that one vote could not be determinative of the election outcome. Therefore, we conclude that NTEU's preelection conduct of providing free legal assistance to five employees did not materially affect the results of the election nor warrant the setting aside of the election. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Golden Age</span>, 415 F.2d at 30.</p>
