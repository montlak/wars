<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-163"><span class="space">k.</span> Multiple Counsel; Duplicative Work</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Use of more than one lawyer on a case is routine. Consultation among lawyers ensures that they do not overlook significant facts or inquiries. <span class="Italic">Bohen v. City of E. Chicago</span>, 666 F. Supp. 154, 157 (N.D. Ind. 1987). It is common for agencies to staff personnel cases with groups of lawyers and personnel specialists. But when appellants are represented by more than one lawyer, the cry may be raised of duplication of effort. As was noted in <span class="Italic">Losure v. ICC</span>, 18 MSPR 388, 393 (1983), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. MSPB</span>, 781 F.2d 191 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the presence of two attorneys at a Board proceeding is not necessarily duplicative. The AJ evaluates the reasonableness of these staffing decisions. It is not necessarily duplicative for two attorneys to interview one witness, given the nature and complexity of a case. <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 152 (1987). The Board may include in the fee formulation time spent by counsel associated with the appellant's principal counsel in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gibson v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 97, 100 (1986). The Board may exclude time of an attorney who seeks fees for time spent interacting with other attorneys having some part in the appeal but who either were not entitled to fees or who did not have a direct representation agreement with the appellant. <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, 123 MSPR 502, 514-15 &#x00B6; 23, 2016 MSPB 28 (2016).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If two attorneys attend one phase of a proceeding, before both are compensated, there should be some explanation of what benefit was provided by the second attorney, <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 12-13 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained the agency's objection to 7 hours, $875, for the preparation and attendance of a second attorney, Mr. Birkel, as a silent observer at the second oral response because another attorney, Mr. Temple, presented the response, which closely followed the transcript of the first oral hearing. The administrative judge found that this duplication was unexplained and not shown to be necessary. <span class="Italic">See Melanson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration,</span> 19 MSPR 228, 232 (1984) (compensation should not be awarded for the appearance of a second attorney where one would do, and claims for such compensation invite careful scrutiny). She also found that the hours devoted to work claimed for the preparation of the submissions in reply to the second proposal were excessive, and that the appellant did not establish a reasonable basis for the amount of time expended for this litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, citing <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 20 MSPR 60 (1984) (holding that the presence of two attorneys in case is not necessarily duplicative), argues that the dual attendance was necessitated by the "extremely complex and voluminous facts involved and the necessary division of labor between the two attorneys." Counsel still, however, does not explain what benefit to the case was obtained by Mr. Birkel's attendance at the second oral reply. Thus, we find that the administrative judge did not err in disallowing these fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Melanson v. VA</span>, 19 MSPR 228, 232 (1984), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency contends that the appearance of both attorneys at prehearing depositions and during the hearing was duplicative and unnecessary. Compensation should not be awarded for the appearance of a second attorney where one would do, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.,</span> 488 F.2d 714, 717 (5th Cir. 1974), and claims for such compensation invite careful scrutiny, <span class="Italic">Hinkle v. Christensen,</span> 548 F. Supp. 630, 632 (D.S.D. 1982). On the other hand, the appearance of more than one attorney can be appropriate in some circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission,</span> 18 MSPR 388 at 393 (1983). Moreover, there is no reason to presume that such representational decisions are frivolously made. Counsel is aware that the additional cost will have to be borne by the appellant if he does not prevail or is not entitled to a fee award even if he does, and where the fee is contingent on success, the additional attorney's hours may not be compensated at all. The presiding official is in the best position to evaluate the reasonableness of such staffing decisions in terms of such factors as the factual or legal complexity of the appeal, the length of the hearing, and the roles of counsel in the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at n.3<span class="Italic">. Accord,</span> <span class="Italic">New York Ass'n for Retarded Children v. Carey,</span> 711 F.2d 1136, 1146 (2d Cir. 1983). Here the presiding official found that co-counsel had an active, supporting role at the hearing. He concluded that her involvement in the case from its beginning and her extensive familiarity with the numerous factual issues justified her continued participation after lead counsel entered the case and her presence at the depositions and the hearing. The petition for review fails to show that this determination was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 64 n.6 (1984), concluded that the presence of two attorneys on a case is not necessarily duplicative and must be evaluated by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Cicero v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 55, 57-58, 4 MSPB 145 (1980), decided that an award of fees was appropriate, but the case was remanded to the AJ for a better analysis of the reasonableness of the fees requested. The Board noted that "the most striking deficiency in this regard is the lack of an hourly breakdown of the attorney's services and expenses." The attorney submitted a list of the work done on the appeal, but he did not submit time records with the list. Without adequate time records, the AJ cannot adequately determine whether the hours claimed are reasonable under the <span class="Italic">Kling</span> standards. The same result occurred in <span class="Italic">Steger v. Defense Investigative Serv</span>., 19 MSPR 462, 465-66 (1984) (remanding a fee request for readjudication). The Board stated in <span class="Italic">Cicero</span>, involving an associate and a partner in a law firm who worked on the case together, that an hourly breakdown was necessary for each attorney. If more <span id="Page_4708"></span>than one attorney was involved in the appeal, it must be determined whether there was duplication of effort and to what extent the second attorney's work was necessary. The AJ was required to evaluate the hourly rate of each attorney in light of their professional standing, experience, status (partner, associate), and specialized expertise under <span class="Italic">Kling</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 86 MSPR 192, 198-202 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-25 (2000), addressed the compensation of two attorneys: one provided assistance during the settlement process; the other had principal responsibility for litigating the appeal. Compensation was appropriate for the contributions of counsel to the settlement process, although deductions were appropriate for work of counsel not directly related to the litigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With his motion for attorney fees, the appellant submitted a declaration from attorney Zabel, the Executive Director of Conflict Resolution &#x0026; Conciliation Services, in which Zabel attested that his counsel to the appellant was not duplicative of that provided by GAP and Seldon and asserted that his "counsel was focused on convening an alternative dispute resolution process to address the outstanding issues from the February 24, 1994 settlement agreement and aligning Mr. Carson's efforts to resolve those outstanding issues with his faith." He stated that his services included direct negotiation and discussions with agency officials. The appellant also submitted a notice of appearance of Zabel as co-counsel, "for purposes of submitting a Fee Petition," dated December 1998, and signed by Zabel and Seldon, and a detailed list of fees incurred between August and November 1996, broken down by specific services rendered, date of service, and time expended on the services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, noting that Zabel did not file a formal notice of appearance as counsel in this case until he filed the motion for attorney fees, argued that Seldon, not Zabel, was the attorney of record in the appellant's case and that Zabel rendered mediation services, not legal services. The agency asserted that there were no references in Zabel's declaration that legal fees were incurred or that legal counsel was provided, and that the declaration infers that Zabel was not engaged in the practice of law but, instead, was a full-time mediator. The agency further argued that an award of attorney fees to Zabel "would likely run afoul of the U.S. Constitutional church/state first amendment provision to the extent that the Agency would arguably be seen as being engaged in the support of appellant's effort to seek religious counseling."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant responded that he had an attorney-client relationship with Zabel and is entitled to attorney fees notwithstanding the fact that Zabel did not file a designation of representative noting his appearance until he filed his motion for attorney fees. He argued that the focus of Zabel's efforts was "finding an alternative means to fulfil/resolve [sic] outstanding issues from the February 25, 1994 settlement agreement that would be acceptable to both the Agency and Mr. Carson and would obviate the need to have this matter resolved by the Board." The appellant further argued that Zabel engaged in direct negotiations with agency officials and that his work on this matter was clearly supportive of Seldon's efforts. He also asserted that "an attorney's legal counsel being grounded in a faith shared by attorney and client does not preclude the award of reasonable fees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fees are incurred by an employee who establishes an attorney-client relationship with a practicing attorney, and establishes that, pursuant to that relationship, counsel renders legal services on the employee's behalf in connection with the employee's appeal before the Board. <span class="Italic">Casali</span>, 81 MSPR 347 &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 2 MSPR at 427 n.9. The cardinal point in establishing an attorney-client relationship is in the client's belief that he is consulting a lawyer in that capacity and that it is his intention to seek professional legal advice. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 24 MSPR 209, 212 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ concluded that the appellant is not entitled to an award of fees because the services Zabel provided were those of a mediator and not services as a co-counsel or legal advisor in which legal services would have been provided. He based this conclusion, in part, on his finding that a mediator serves as a neutral third person who helps disputing parties to reach agreement through the mediation process, and that the services of a mediator are not legal services for purposes of establishing entitlement to attorney fees. Without reaching the question of whether an attorney serving as a mediator may ever be entitled to an award of attorney fees, we find, as discussed below, that the appellant has shown that Zabel served as the appellant's settlement attorney, and not as the parties' mediator in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A mediator is a "[n]eutral third person who helps disputing parties to reach agreement through the mediation process." Black's Law Dictionary 981 (6th ed. 1990). Here, it is undisputed that the agency did not consent to mediation and engage Zabel's services in any capacity; rather, the appellant is the only party who contracted for Zabel's services. Contrary to the AJ's findings, there is no evidence that the appellant contracted for mediation services or that he received such services from Zabel. Rather, the appellant and Zabel alleged below and on petition for review that Zabel was one of his settlement attorneys, providing direct legal counsel on the appellant's behalf in his pursuit of finding an alternative resolution to a Board disposition of the outstanding issues from the February 25, 1994 settlement agreement. These allegations are supported by Zabel's declaration and billing record, the notice of appearance of Zabel as co-counsel, "for purposes of submitting a Fee Petition," signed by Zabel and Seldon, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, Seldon's reference to Zabel as "our co-counsel" in Seldon's December 28, 1998 letter to the AJ, and the agency representative's assertion that "the Agency is not in a position to admit nor deny whether and to what extent to which Mr. Zabel participated and/or assisted Mr. Seldon with the legal assistance claimed." Under these circumstances, we find that Zabel's services on the appellant's behalf were not those of a mediator, but rather were those of a legal counselor and adviser. <span class="Italic">Cf. People ex rel. Colorado Bar Association v. Lindsey</span>, 86 Colo. 458, 283 P. 539, 544-45 (1929) (finding no merit to respondent's claim of title to mediator, in lieu of that of an attorney and counselor at law, given that he was the originator of aggressive, militant action by the guardian of the minors' estate to obtain a larger contribution from the sole devisee of the estate).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued that Zabel's list of services provided does not contain any that would traditionally be associated with the practice of law such as "drafting legal documents, doing legal research, appearances before judges, [and] filing legal papers, etc." However, Zabel's list of services provided include calls and meetings with Seldon, the appellant, and agency officials to discuss alternative resolutions to a Board disposition of the compliance proceeding, and numerous discussions with the appellant concerning tactics. The appellant and Zabel asserted below and on petition for review, and the agency does not specifically dispute, that Zabel performed these services as the appellant's settlement attorney. It is well established that attorney fees can be awarded for an attorney's role in settling an appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Casali</span>, 81 MSPR 347 &#x00B6; 7. Moreover, the Board has a long-standing commitment to the use of alternative dispute resolution to resolve matters submitted to it for adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> 64 Fed. Reg. 27,899 (1999). Under the circumstances, we find that Zabel was serving in an attorney-client relationship with the appellant, i.e., as one of the appellant's settlement attorneys, in the compliance proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No basis for disturbing this finding is shown by either the fact that Zabel did not file a notice of appearance or other legal documents on the appellant's behalf until he filed his motion for attorney fees or by the agency's assertion that there was no written attorney-client agreement between the appellant and Zabel. Contrary to the agency's argument, whether Zabel filed a notice of appearance during the compliance proceeding or whether a fee agreement existed are not dispositive<span class="Italic">. See Gearan v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 42 MSPR 313, 316 (1989) ("the amount that a prevailing employee has agreed to pay for legal consultation may qualify as 'attorney fees' even if the attorney does not represent the appellant at the Board's hearing and does not submit documents to the Board in connection with the employee's appeal"; the failure of an employee to formally designate a representative with the Board does not detract from the evidence of record demonstrating the existence of an attorney-client relationship); <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Department of the Army</span>, 5 MSPB 106, 5 MSPR 26, 27 (1981) (whether the employee was obligated to pay the attorney fees in question is immaterial to the determination of whether an attorney-client relationship exists).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is any basis for disturbing this finding shown by the fact that Seldon was the appellant's attorney of record in the compliance proceedings. Contrary to the agency's argument, more than one attorney, including an attorney who solely provides legal consultation, may qualify for an award of attorney fees in an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Casali</span>, 81 MSPR 347 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16; <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 430, 435-36 (1990). Thus, the presence of more than one attorney does not preclude our finding that both Seldon and Zabel served in attorney-client relationships with the appellant in the compliance proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not cited any legal precedent, and we are unaware of any, that would preclude the Board from finding the existence of an attorney-client relationship where, as here, the attorney was of the same religious faith as the appellant and asserted that he also counseled the appellant on aligning his efforts to resolve the outstanding legal issues with his religious faith. To the extent that services provided by Zabel were not legal or did not significantly contribute to the success of the Board proceeding and eliminate the need for work that would have otherwise have been required in the Board proceeding, then fees for such services are not recoverable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presence of more than one attorney and the allegation that Zabel provided nonlegal services, e.g., religious counseling, raises questions about the reasonableness of the fees requested. An attorney fees request is to be reduced as necessary to disallow hours for duplication or padding. <span class="Italic">Casali</span>, 81 MSPR 347 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">see Kelly</span>, 43 MSPR at 435-36 (consultation services provided by former AJ were not duplicative of services provided by the employee's attorney of record and were reasonable); <span class="Italic">Key v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 152-53 (1987) (the presence of two attorneys at a Board proceeding is not necessarily duplicative). The amount of fees claimed is to be reduced where the record does not show that the <span id="Page_4709"></span>expenditure of the claimed hours was necessary. <span class="Italic">Casali</span>, 81 MSPR 347 &#x00B6; 14. The number of hours claimed may be reduced even when it is not outrageous or unprecedented but there is insufficient evidence to establish that it is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, to be found "reasonable," legal work for which fees are requested must be shown to have "significantly contributed to the success of the Board proceeding and eliminated the need for work that would otherwise have been required in the Board proceeding." <span class="Italic">Casali</span>, 81 MSPR 347 &#x00B6; 16 (citing <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 446 (1991), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Bonggat v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 175, 178-79 (1993)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the AJ is in the best position to evaluate the documentation submitted by counsel to determine whether the amount requested is reasonable, and to evaluate the quality of representation afforded by counsel, <span class="Italic">see Mullins-Howard</span>, 71 MSPR at 627, we REMAND this case to the regional office for further adjudication of the appellant's motion for attorney fees consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A law firm partner and an associate typically work a case together. This arrangement, though well recognized in the private sector, attracts adverse attention from some who do not understand how private practitioners collaborate to produce quality work at reasonable cost. In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 834 F.2d 1011, 1012-13 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the AJ refused to award compensation for time spent by an associate in a law firm on a Board case because, in the opinion of the AJ, the fee petition did not demonstrate how there was no duplication in the work on the appellate briefs of the partner (who essentially reviewed and revised the briefs) and the associate (who researched and wrote the first drafts of the briefs). The Federal Circuit said of the Board's conclusions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official deleted the work-time of the associate on the grounds that...his work was duplicative of the principal attorney's own efforts. These findings are not supported by substantial evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The...ground given in the initial opinion--duplication--is...wanting. An associate's function is usually to help the principal, to do research and "scut work," to make suggestions and to prepare first drafts. This is not at all duplication but an aid to his principal's functioning--quite comparable to that of a law clerk to a judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Santella v. Special Counsel</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SANTELLA_FRANK_CB_1215_91_0007_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248436.pdf">86 MSPR 48</a>, 66-67 &#x00B6; 37 (2000), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 90 MSPR 172 (2001), analyzed and sustained counsel fees awarded for the work of five attorneys in one firm working for two clients who were successful respondents to an OSC disciplinary case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC reiterates its contention that the use of five attorneys was unnecessary and led to duplicative billing on certain dates, and it requests that the $5,543.00 in fees incurred by three of the attorneys (other than lead attorneys Bransford and Veilleux) be subtracted from the award. OSC is correct that the petitioners bear the burden of explaining how the use of multiple attorneys benefited the case. <span class="Italic">See Rose v. Department of the Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 12-13 (1991). Again, however, we agree with the CALJ that the petitioners' counsel satisfied this burden by explaining that the three associates were used for certain tasks because they have a lower hourly rate than Mr. Bransford or Ms. Veilleux. <span class="Italic">See Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 64 n.6 (1984). In addition, to the extent OSC claims that multiple attorneys performed the same tasks on certain dates, the petitioners' attorneys have explained how those tasks differed, or why more than one attorney was needed. They have also pointed out that they did not bill each petitioner for identical work, but rather, when they did work that related to both, split the charges between them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ should reduce fees for work that is clearly unnecessary, as in <span class="Italic">Freeman v. VA</span>, 66 MSPR 125, 132-33 (1995). There, time was reduced for the task of preparing outlines for cross-examination of witnesses who the AJ earlier ruled would not testify. Five hours of over seven hours claimed were eliminated from compensable time for counsel who spent the seven hours preparing for cross-examination of a witness whose testimony, the Board decided, could not have taken more than about half an hour. The Board noted that "[w]e fail to see why the appellant's counsel needed 7.7 hours in advance of the hearing to formulate his approach to cross-examining Marnell, when most of his questions should have come to mind during the agency's direct examination." The Board also reduced time claimed in <span class="Italic">Freeman</span> when counsel charged 20.1 hours during a single day for research and preparing for a prehearing conference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There is no indication that the appellant's counsel was then facing an impending deadline in this case that would have necessitated the expenditure of such an extraordinary amount of time in a single day. Further, we doubt that even the most energetic attorney can work efficiently for such an extended period. Without adopting a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule regarding the maximum amount of time in a single day for which an attorney can receive compensation for work on a Board appeal, we find the 20.1 hours claimed for March 18, 1993 to be excessive, and we reduce the time by 7 hours.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Freeman</span> approved 15.4 hours claimed for hearing preparation on a day that included hearing time and preparation for the next day's hearing, 66 MSPR at 133:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot say that the hours the appellant's counsel spent on April 8 preparing for the hearing were excessive, in light of the many demands placed on an attorney at such a time. Further, the hours devoted to the hearing itself were largely in the control of the administrative judge, not the appellant's counsel, and in any event there is no indication that the appellant's counsel engaged in dilatory tactics at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An assertion of duplicative or excessive work relative to drafts and revisions to a PFR was rejected in <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 590, 609 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's second category of objection is that some of the claims are "duplicative." Here, OPM's argument is speculative. For example, OPM objects that the appellant's attorney submitted a claim for drafting the petition for review on May 12, 1994, at 4.00 hours; for revising it on May 13, also at 4.00 hours; and for a final revision, on May 17, at 0.50 hours. OPM argues only: "Much of this work may be duplication...." We note that there is no claim that the petition for review was not the petition involved in this case. We note, also, that the time allotted for the first draft included an office conference with the client. We note, further, that the timing of this work does not support any inference that the work was merely "expanding to fill the time allotted." The appellant's petition for review was filed on May 18, 1994, almost immediately after the May 13-17 work involved. For all these reasons, we find no merit to OPM's speculative argument as to "duplication."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's third category of objection can be classified under the heading of "excessive time claimed." OPM objects that the 8.5 hours claimed for preparation of the petition for review, as set forth above, is excessive, as well as duplicative. We are not persuaded, however, by OPM's claim that a request for eight-and-one-half hours for the preparation of the petition is unreasonable or excessive. Indeed, we find that OPM's attack on the appellant's counsel's attorney fee claim "verges on nit-picking." <span class="Italic">See Freeman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 66 MSPR 125, 131 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stein v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 537, 543 (1994) (allowing time spent by the principal of a law firm reviewing materials prepared by an associate); <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 467, 472 (1995) (same). As a corollary to our discussion of duplication of work, one should carefully apportion time spent on cases handled simultaneously if recovery is to be for but one case. Hours awarded should reimburse counsel only for the services directly and proportionally attributable to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Kenyon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 258, 263 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Hoyt v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 28 MSPR 275, 279 (1985)); <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 21 MSPR 596, 601 (1984), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
