<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-113"><span class="space">a.</span> Decisions Before 1994</h5>
<p class="noindent">Before the Supreme Court ruled, FLRA decided hundreds of name and address cases, as many agencies forced the issuance of a ULP complaint, a <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">forma</span> opinion from an ALJ, and an equally <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">forma</span> decision from FLRA. We review the trail of litigation leading to the Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of whether an employer was required to provide the union with names and home addresses of all unit employees represented by the union arose in <span class="Italic">FHA Fin. Office and AFGE Local 3354</span>, 19 FLRA 195, 195-98 (1985) (following remand from D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">FHA Fin. Office and AFGE Local 3354</span>, 23 FLRA 788 (1986), <span class="Italic">post</span>). FLRA initially concluded that there was no disclosure requirement. Although FLRA would later revise its position, it reasoned that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) limits an agency's obligation to furnish data to the extent not prohibited by law, and that phrase included the Privacy Act. The names and addresses of unit employees constituted information retrievable from agency records within the Privacy Act. The issue was whether the <span id="Page_375"></span>exception to the Privacy Act under 5 USC 552a(b)(2) permitted disclosure of information required to be released under the Freedom of Information Act. That determination required a balancing of interests under exemption (b)(6) of FOIA (5 USC 552(b)(6)), a section that exempts information from disclosure if the disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. FLRA quoted from the analysis of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 v. DHHS</span>, 712 F.2d 931, 932 (4th Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Employees have a strong privacy interest in their home addresses. Disclosure could subject the employees to an unchecked barrage of mailings and perhaps personal solicitations, for no effective restraints could be placed on the range of uses to which the information, once revealed, might be put. Further, even granting that collective bargaining is a matter of grave public concern, any benefits flowing from disclosure of the information sought would inure primarily to the union, in a proprietary sense, rather than to the public at large. Finally, as the District Court noted, alternative means of communication are available to the union, such as its bulletin board and indirect distribution through the employer....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA determined that the union had adequate alternate means of communications, including contractually authorized desk drops of information, direct distributions at entrances, meetings in conference rooms allowed under the contract, and union stewards who had access to unit employees at their workplaces. Names and addresses were again denied after it was determined that the union could have communicated with unit employees through bulletin boards, a union newspaper, meeting space during nonduty hours, semi-annual membership drives, and a network of union officers and stewards. That some of those communications were subject to restrictions, including advance requests, did not make the means unavailable. <span class="Italic">DMA Aerospace Ctr. and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 19 FLRA 675 (1985). The right to names and addresses was denied once more when there were alternate means of communication available, even though there were restrictions, e.g., the right of the agency to disapprove union entries in the agency newspaper. <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council</span>, 19 FLRA 899, 901 n.5 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 v. FLRA</span>, 786 F.2d 554, 556-57 (2d Cir. 1986), reached a contrary result:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin by noting that the privacy interest of the average employee in his address is not particularly compelling.&#x2003;Generally, addresses are often available through other public records. Moreover, the Union already has access to information that is more likely to implicate privacy concerns, for example, salary levels. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 294.702.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we have previously ruled that exemption (b)(6) applies only to facts which, if public, "could subject the person to harassment, disgrace, loss of employment, or friends." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, 658 F.2d 71, 75 (2d Cir. 1981). The District of Columbia Circuit reached a similar conclusion in <span class="Italic">Getman v. NLRB</span>, 450 F.2d 670, 676 (D.C. Cir. 1971) ("bare name and address" not embarrassing). The intervenors strongly urge that <span class="Italic">Getman</span> and its progeny were overturned in <span class="Italic">Department of State v. Washington Post Co.</span>, 456 U.S. 595 (1982). But in the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> case, however, the Supreme Court ruled solely on whether certain files fell within the ambit of exemption (b)(6) and expressly declined to apply the balancing test....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering the other side of the balancing test, the Authority and intervenors offer two reasons for failing to accord much weight to the Union's needs. It is argued the Union enjoys alternative means of communication, such as bulletin boards and quarterly newsletters distributed on the premises. It is true that these avenues of communication are guaranteed by the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The administrative law judge, however, found that these alternatives were inadequate. Moreover, in private sector cases, we have regarded the mere existence of alternatives as insufficient to justify the refusal to release addresses. <span class="Italic">United Aircraft Corp. v. NLRB,</span> 434 F.2d 1198, 1205-06 (2d Cir. 1970), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 401 U.S. 993 (1971); <span class="Italic">Prudential Insurance Co. v. NLRB</span>, 412 F.2d 77 (2d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 396 U.S. 928 (1969). In these cases, of course, we drew our rule of decision from the National Labor Relations Act, but the privacy implications of address release are essentially the same in either the public or private sector.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the respondent and intervenors suggest that release of the addresses would not be in the public interest. By labeling the AFGE's interest "proprietary," they seek to denigrate the role of the Union. The AFGE, it is suggested, desires the disputed information merely to solicit union membership. This view, however, ignores the Congressional determination that collective bargaining in federal employment is in the public interest, and that a union, as exclusive bargaining agent, must communicate with the employees it represents. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b). In the private sector, we have decisively rejected fear of union solicitation as a ground for failure to release addresses. <span class="Italic">Prudential</span>...<span class="Italic">Supra</span> at 84-85.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, the Authority's position is grounded on the authority of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 v. DHHS</span>, 712 F.2d 931 (4th Cir. 1983). The Fourth Circuit, however, dealt with the issue of privacy interest in addresses in a cursory manner....&#8197;Indeed, we note that Chief Judge Winter wrote a vigorous dissent emphasizing the same grounds that we have set forth....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in light of the modest privacy interest in revealing addresses alone...we hold that the release of the employees' address is not "prohibited by law" within the meaning of the Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent">Based on the court's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 </span>and other circuit appeals, including the<span class="Italic"> FHA </span>case, FLRA obtained a remand from the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">FHA</span>, and changed its position in<span class="Italic"> FHA Fin. Office and AFGE Local 3354</span>, 23 FLRA 788, 792-93 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the disclosure of the requested information is required by FOIA, the Privacy Act's bar to disclosure is not applicable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2). Under the FOIA, requested information must be disclosed unless it falls within one of the enumerated exemptions. The exemption pertinent to this case is exemption (b)(6) which authorizes withholding information in "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the previous decision in this case, the Authority balanced employees' privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure and found that the requested information fell within exemption (b)(6). In doing so, the Authority relied on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span>, 712 F.2d 931. For the following reasons, we reverse our previous decision on this point and find that the requested information may not be withheld pursuant to exemption (b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is necessary to balance competing interests to determine whether requested information falls within exemption (b)(6). It is also important to recognize...that the FOIA embodies a "general philosophy of full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language." <span class="Italic">Department of Air Force v. Rose</span>, 425 U.S. 352, 360-61 (1976). Further, exemption (b)(6)'s limitation to "clearly unwarranted" disclosures instructs us to "tilt the balance in favor of disclosure." <span class="Italic">Getman v. NLRB</span>, 450 F.2d 670, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1971).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this framework, we find that the balance favors disclosure of the names and home addresses sought by the Union. In section 7101 of the Statute Congress found that collective bargaining in the Government is in the public interest and safeguards that interest. The disclosure of the information sought would enable the Union to identify the members of the bargaining unit which it is required to represent. Disclosure also would contribute to the Union's ability to communicate with its bargaining unit members and thereby enable it to better fulfill its responsibilities under the Statute. If employees are to exercise their statutory rights, they must be aware of the issues affecting them. By providing the Union with an efficient method of communication, disclosure of names and home addresses will facilitate the fullest exercise of employee rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On further consideration of this case, we also agree with the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that "the privacy interest of the average employee in his address is not particularly compelling." 786 F.2d at 556. For example,...these employees already receive and often discard unsolicited mail. There is, of course, nothing to prevent these employees from handling communications from the Union in the same way, nor are employees prevented from requesting that they be deleted from the Union's mailing list. As noted by the Second Circuit, a union already has access to information such as salary levels that is more likely to implicate privacy concerns than the information sought here....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the public interest to be furthered by providing the Union with an efficient method to communicate with unit employees it must represent far outweighs the privacy interests of individual employees in their names and home addresses. Disclosure of the requested information would not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA also determined in <span class="Italic">FHA</span> that the use of home addresses was a routine use of records under OPM regulations implementing exception (b)(3) of the Privacy Act. Additionally, the request for names and addresses need not contain a specific reason for the request. The union's need was so apparent and so essentially related to the nature of exclusive representation itself that, unlike requests for certain types of other information, an agency's duty to supply the information did not depend upon any separate explanation by the union of its reasons for seeking the information. The existence of alternative means of communication was insufficient to justify the refusal to release the information. FLRA said that it would not direct release of names and addresses if evidence demonstrated that the union had acted so that employees whose addresses would be disclosed would be in imminent danger if the union knew where they lived. Although there was prolific litigation over union requests for names and addresses of unit members, the case law did not, however, go much beyond disclosure of that type of identifying information. FLRA found too intrusive a request for employees' home telephone numbers. <span class="Italic">SSA, Hemet Branch Office and AFGE</span>, 43 FLRA 455, 456-57 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">Release of information concerning names and addresses of unit employees was not necessarily tied to the ease of the search. The information was to be compiled and released, even if the retrieval was only possible through a manual search of records, as long as there was some means of determining <span id="Page_376"></span>names, addresses, and the unit status of employees. <span class="Italic">Fairchild AFB and NFFE Local 11</span>, 28 FLRA 948, 950 (1987). A conclusory allegation that the release of home addresses would result in a risk to national security was rejected in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Pittsburgh Energy Technology Ctr. and AFGE Local 1916</span>, 33 FLRA 249, 250-51 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville and IAM Local 830</span>, 33 FLRA 3, 5 (1988), the agency sought to prove that release of the names and addresses of some unit members might compromise their safety. The Authority dismissed those objections: "[m]ere speculation" that the information might be misused in the future does not equate with a clear and present danger. In accordance with <span class="Italic">Naval Ordnance Station Louisville</span>, <span class="Italic">VA Riverside Nat'l Cemetery and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 33 FLRA 316, 317 (1988), resolved that it was immaterial, for purposes of disclosure of names and addresses, that 22 of the 34 members of the unit requested that the employer keep their home addresses confidential.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if other means of contacting individuals might be insufficient without lists of names and addresses, the information sought was still required to pertain to the employment relationship between the union, those it represents, and the employer. FLRA declined to conclude that an agency committed a ULP by refusing to provide to the union the names and addresses of persons tentatively selected for employment. Many of those selected did not accept the job offers, or for other reasons did not become employees. Although there might have been circumstances warranting the release of information about prospective employees, i.e., those who have a substantial expectation of becoming employees, the information sought by the union was too remote because of the uncertainty of the recruits' prospective employment. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 36 FLRA 871, 873-74 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the years that followed FLRA 's principal decisions on the release of unit employees' home addresses, considerable litigation resulted from challenges in the appellate courts to FLRA orders requiring address disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent">In October of 1992, the Fifth Circuit weighed in to compel disclosure in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOD, Dept. of Navy, Navy CBC Exch.</span>, 975 F.2d 1105, 1116 (5th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">DOD v. FLRA</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1006 (1994), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Fifth Circuit determination would lead to the Supreme Court decision resolving against unions the right to obtain unit members' home names and addresses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Other circuits diverged in analysis and results in the name and address cases. FLRA remained resolute despite judicial setbacks. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Memphis and NAGE</span>, 46 FLRA 1264, 1264-66 (1993); <span class="Italic">Navy Ship Weapon Sys. Eng'r Station, Port Hueneme and NAGE Local R12-40</span>, 42 FLRA 365, 367-68 (1991); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 4</span>, 37 FLRA 515, 523-25 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">The First Circuit decided in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Navy, Naval Communications Unit Cutler</span>, 941 F.2d 49, 59-60 (1991), that collective bargaining interests were irrelevant to the disclosure analysis and that no presumption of necessity would be applied to a request for home names and addresses under &#x00A7; 7114. The court set aside <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 4</span>, 37 FLRA 515 (1990) (and <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Communications Unit Cutler and AFGE Local 2635</span>, 37 FLRA 550 (1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Third Circuit initially required disclosure of names and addresses in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 1131, 1139 (3d Cir. 1988). On reexamination, the court initially declined to accept FLRA 's position, but then vacated its opinion and reheard the case <span class="Italic">en banc</span>. It reversed positions of the majority and dissents so that the court, in its second opinion, sustained FLRA, ordering release of names and addresses. The court's <span class="Italic">en</span> <span class="Italic">banc</span> decision (including the dissent that essentially formed the prior opinion) is at <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Navy, Navy Ships Parts Control Ctr.</span>, 966 F.2d 747, 765-76 (3d Cir. 1992). The first decision in that case was reported at <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Navy, Navy Ships Parts Control Ctr.</span>, 944 F.2d 1088 (3d Cir. 1991), until that opinion was vacated as a result of the decision to consider the case <span class="Italic">en</span> <span class="Italic">banc.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DHHS v. FLRA</span>, 833 F.2d 1129, 1134-36 (4th Cir. 1987), and <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, NOAA, 954 F.2d 994, 997 (4th Cir. 1992), the Fourth Circuit affirmed and reaffirmed the rights of unions to names and addresses. After <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, the Sixth Circuit weighed in to follow the First Circuit, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Navy, Naval Resale Activity</span>, 963 F.2d 124, 125 (6th Cir. 1992), and the Second Circuit, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. VA</span>, 958 F.2d 503, 516 (2d Cir. 1992)</p>
<p class="noindent">The Seventh Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Exch., Naval Training Station, Great Lakes v. FLRA</span>, 975 F.2d 348, 353-56 (7th Cir. 1992), denied enforcement of an Authority order directing release of names and addresses. The circuit considered the impact of the <span class="Italic">Reporters' Committee</span> case and concluded that no public interest was served by disclosure of the information sought by the union. The court concluded that it could only consider "whether the core purpose of FOIA, letting the citizenry know what its government is up to, will be served by release of the employees' home addresses." Deciding that disclosure did not so serve the citizenry, disclosure was not compulsory. The circuit effectively overruled an earlier pre-<span class="Italic">Reporters' Committee</span> decision, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, 838 F.2d 229, 232-33 (7th Cir. 1988), directing disclosure of names and addresses.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Eighth Circuit affirmed FLRA's analysis in part, requiring agencies to disclose names and addresses of unit employees other than those employees who specifically request that their employers keep that information confidential. <span class="Italic">USDA v. FLRA</span>, 836 F.2d 1139, 1143-44 (8th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">vacated</span> 109 S. Ct. 831 (1989), <span class="Italic">dismissed as moot</span>, 876 F.2d 50, 51 (8th Cir. 1989) (controversy was moot because the agency had adopted the practice of releasing names to unions without an exception for employees who sought to keep the information confidential).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Tenth Circuit denied access to names and addresses in the absence of a finding that alternate means of communication are inadequate, a finding absent from the Authority's decision. <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOD, AAFES, Dallas</span>, 984 F.2d 370, 375-76 (10th Cir. 1993) (providing status report detailing the split in the circuits: the D.C. Circuit, First, Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits prohibiting disclosure; the Ninth, Third, and Fifth Circuits requiring disclosure; the Fourth Circuit reconsidering the issue <span class="Italic">en banc</span> at the time of the issuance of the Tenth Circuit decision). The Eleventh Circuit joined the nondisclosure circuits in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOD, Dept. of Navy, Pensacola Navy Exch.</span>, 977 F.2d 545, 547-48 (11th Cir. 1992), noting that: the FLMRS provides for disclosure to the extent not prohibited by law, 5 USC 7114(b)(4)(B); and certain statutes were excluded from the constraints of the Privacy Act, e.g., FOIA and the Debt Collection Act, and Congress could have exempted the FLMRS as well, had it desired.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit, parting company with the other circuits, resolved that unions did not have a right to names and addresses. <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Treasury, Fin. Mgmt. Serv.</span>, 884 F.2d 1446, 1453, 1456 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Although the disclosures were necessary for the collective bargaining process, the disclosures violated the Privacy Act because they did not fall within the FOIA exemptions to the Privacy Act, and the disclosures did not qualify as a routine use under the Privacy Act.</p>
