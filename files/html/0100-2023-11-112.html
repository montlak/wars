<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-113"><span class="space">1.</span> Criminal Conviction</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The theory of identity of issues arises most frequently if the appellant was involved in a criminal proceeding. The Board's seminal decision on the subject, <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. DLA</span>, 3 MSPR 171, 3 MSPB 273 (1980), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Chisolm v. DLA</span>, 656 F.2d 42 (3d Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">post</span>, considered how an appellant's prior criminal conviction may effect collateral estoppel in Board proceedings by precluding the appellant from refuting a charge supporting an adverse action if the conviction and the agency's charge involve the same misconduct. The case involved an assault on a coworker. Despite a conviction, the AJ found the agency evidence insufficient. Reopening the case on its own motion, the Board determined that traditionally three requirements precondition collateral estoppel through the binding effect of a criminal conviction on civil proceedings involving the same issues: the issue to be resolved must be identical to that involved in the prior action; the issue must have been actually litigated in the prior action; and the determination of the issue in the prior action must have been necessary and essential to the resulting judgment. Collateral estoppel, when justified under those criteria, is applied in Board cases to avoid unnecessary litigation. The result is considered fair because in a criminal case the standard of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, is higher than the preponderance of evidence standard applied in Board appeals. Under <span class="Italic">Chisholm</span>, if the appellant pleads innocent and is represented by counsel, conviction carries with it a presumption that the defendant had a full and fair defense. The appellant may challenge the estoppel effect of the criminal conviction if he can show that substantively or procedurally he was denied the opportunity to a full and fair defense during the criminal proceeding. Whether a criminal conviction will collaterally estop an appellant from contesting a charge based on the facts underlying the conviction will depend on state law defining collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mosby v. DHUD</span>, 114 MSPR 674, 676-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7, 2010 MSPB 198 (2010) (applying the law of the District of Columbia); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Holt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-16-0129-I-2 (NP 1/30/2023) (following <span class="Italic">Mosby</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On judicial review, <span class="Italic">Chisolm</span> was remanded for further consideration of the evidence necessary to support collateral estoppel. The Board was required to make a more extensive comparison between the charges supporting the adverse action, the criminal statute encompassed in the judgment of conviction and, if necessary, the evidence or documentation developed during the criminal court proceedings defining the scope of the criminal conviction for purposes of comparison with the civil service charges, <span class="Italic">Chisolm v. DLA</span>, 656 F.2d 42, 45-50 (3d Cir. 1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency introduced a copy of the report of the dispensary where <span id="Page_1549"></span>Lewis was treated following the incident. This report listed her complaint as an upset stomach and noted that she was placed on restricted duty for two days. In addition, the Agency introduced the evidence at issue here, two Judgment and Probation Commitment Orders indicating that Chisholm had been found guilty on June 22, 1979 before a Magistrate of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania of the separate offenses of assault and disorderly conduct based on the incident which also led to the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chisholm, testifying on his own behalf, acknowledged occurrence of the incident but denied any assault. He said that he sought to talk to Lewis and when she walked away from him he reached out to stop her. He stated that he never actually touched her and that he stopped following her when he heard Evelyn Waller, a union steward, yelling out to him to stop. Waller also testified, stating that she had witnessed the entire incident except for approximately three minutes when she was walking around the bins to intercede in the argument. Waller testified that she saw Chisholm following Lewis and reaching out to grab her but that he stopped when Waller yelled and never actually touched Lewis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his decision, the presiding official analyzed the evidence and made credibility determinations regarding the witnesses' testimony. He found that Lewis "display[ed] hostility" towards Chisholm and also found that her testimony of being punched in the stomach area by Chisholm while he was following her "strains one's credibility." He found some of Brehm's testimony to be contradictory, and thought that petitioner's witness, Waller, "gave more reliable testimony on this matter." The presiding official also concluded that the Agency medical report did not corroborate the extent of injuries claimed by Lewis, noting there was no evidence in the report of bruises, broken ribs or stomach injury resulting from a blow. Accordingly, the presiding official reversed the agency action because he found it was not supported by a preponderance of the credible evidence. The presiding official's opinion did not mention the prior criminal convictions based on the same incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board on its own motion reopened the appeal in order to address what it termed the significant issue of first impression before it of whether an employee's prior criminal conviction may effect a collateral estoppel to preclude the employee from denying an agency's charge relating to the same incident of misconduct. After receiving briefs from the Agency and an intervenor, the Office of Personnel Management, in support of the use of collateral estoppel and from petitioner in opposition, the Board concluded that collateral estoppel was appropriate in proceedings before an administrative agency and that the instant situation warranted its use. The Board found that the failure of the presiding official to consider the collateral estoppel issue contravened Board regulations and further that his failure to accord full estoppel effect to the convictions was in error. The Board then concluded that "[u]pon full review of the record on appeal...the agency's charge that the (petitioner) shoved and struck another employee, while both were on duty, is supported by the preponderance of the evidence." It further concluded, without discussion, that the Agency's removal of petitioner "promotes the efficiency of the service under the circumstances of this case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal petitioner raises three arguments: first, that collateral estoppel is not an appropriate doctrine for use in administrative disciplinary proceedings; second, that the Judgment and Probation Commitment Orders on which the Board relied without examination of the pleadings, transcript or record of the criminal proceeding could support the use of collateral estoppel to demonstrate only that petitioner had committed the least serious conduct which would violate the statute, i.e., "the least touching of another person's body wilfully"; and third, that reliance on the Judgment and Probation Commitment Orders does not support a reversal of the presiding official's factual finding that the Agency had not proven that petitioner's misconduct resulted in Lewis' inability to perform her full range of duties for two days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency contends that the principles underlying the use of collateral estoppel in the courts are applicable to quasi-judicial bodies within administrative agencies and that the use of collateral estoppel in this case met the requirements for its use which this court has established. In response to petitioner's contention that there was no evidence to support a reversal of the presiding official on the question of injury, the Agency contends that the dispensary report constitutes undisputed evidence of injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The use of a prior criminal conviction as collateral estoppel in administrative proceedings has apparently not been directly adjudicated. Nevertheless the same policy reasons which underlie use of collateral estoppel in judicial proceedings are equally applicable when the administrative board acts as an adjudicatory body. It is well established that the doctrine of collateral estoppel contributes to efficient judicial administration, serving the public interest in judicial economy as well as the parties' interests in finality, certainty of affairs and avoidance of unnecessary relitigation<span class="Italic">. See Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation</span>, 402 U.S. 313, 328-30, 91 S.C. 1434, 1442-43, 28 L. Ed.2d 788 (1971); F. James &#x0026; G. Hazard, <span class="Italic">Civil Procedure</span>, &#x00A7; 11.2 (2d ed. 1977); Semmel, <span class="Italic">Collateral Estoppel, Mutuality and Joinder of Parties</span>, 68 Colum. L. Rev. 1457, 1457 n.2 (1968). We <span class="Italic">see</span> no obstacle to the Board's use of the judicially developed doctrine of collateral estoppel in an appropriate case unless the legislative scheme indicates otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Congress established the Board as "a quasi-judicial body, empowered to determine when abuses or violations of law have occurred, and to order corrective action," S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 24 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2746. The Board's hearing officers, termed "presiding officials," must make findings of fact and conclusions of law, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.111 (1980). Where the agency's adverse action against an employee is based on alleged misconduct, the presiding official must determine whether the employee's alleged misconduct did in fact occur, <span class="Italic">see Phillips v. Bergland</span>, 586 F.2d 1007, 1010-11 (4th Cir. 1978), and the Board in affirming must conclude that this finding is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B) (Supp. III 1979). A prior criminal conviction based on the same misconduct is ordinarily premised on the occurrence of the misconduct. There is therefore no logical reason why the prior conviction should not be given collateral estoppel effect to establish this relevant predicate fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner relies on decisions by labor arbitrators declining to accord preclusive effect to prior court judgments to support his argument that collateral estoppel is inappropriate in agency proceedings. Specifically, he refers us to the following quote from <span class="Italic">In re Chrysler Corp.</span>, 53 Lab. Arb. Rep. 1279, 1282 (1969):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t is well established that in the absence of a contrary stipulation by the parties, determinations by other tribunals of issues arising on the same facts are not binding on arbitrators. Thus a ruling by a Workman's Compensation Board as to disability, or by an Unemployment Compensation Board as to eligibility for benefits, or by courts of law as to criminal or civil responsibility, do not by themselves foreclose an arbitrator from proceeding to judgment on issues submitted to him on the basis of the evidence and arguments presented to him. I do not know what evidence and or argument was presented at the Recorders Court trial. I do not know what rules of law the Court applied. I do not know what elements of the evidence submitted to it persuaded the jury to come to its conclusion. My responsibility is to formulate my own judgment based on the result recited below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the labor arbitration situation, the Department of the Treasury has codified the collateral estoppel doctrine in a regulation, which provides that a conviction of an attorney under the revenue laws of the United States or of any offense involving breach of trust or dishonesty satisfies the statutory standard of disreputable conduct for which the attorney may be disbarred or suspended from practice before the Internal Revenue Service, 31 CFR &#x00A7; 10.51(a) (1980). Courts have upheld disbarments based solely on the government's proof of such convictions without permitting the convicted attorney to challenge the validity of the conviction<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is questionable whether the <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> approach represents the uniform position taken in all labor arbitration cases. In any event, the difference in function and responsibility of labor arbitrators and administrative boards makes the petitioner's analogy inapposite. As the Supreme Court noted in <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co.</span>, 363 U.S. 574, 581-82, 80 S.C. 1347, 1352, 4 L. Ed.2d 1409 (1960), arbitrators are part of a system of self-government created by contract between private parties and are not public tribunals imposed upon the parties by external authorities. A labor arbitrator generally decides the particular dispute on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis. In furtherance of the statutorily mandated deference to and encouragement of such private settlement, a court generally will not intrude itself into an arbitrator's evaluation of facts and law. It will act only to guarantee that the arbitrator adheres to the terms of the parties' agreement and to ensure the minimally accepted level of rationality<span class="Italic">. See International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 249 v. Western Pennsylvania Motor Carriers Association</span>, 574 F.2d 783 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 439 U.S. 828, 99 S.C. 102, 58 L. Ed.2d 122 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, when an administrative agency acts as a quasi-judicial body, it fulfills the same function as a court, <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to make a determination which is consistent with the public interest as reflected in the governing statute. Such agencies are subject to the requirement that they not act arbitrarily or capriciously, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC s 706(2)(A) (1976), and have an obligation to render consistent opinions and to either follow, distinguish or overrule their own precedent<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Secretary of Agriculture v. United States</span>, 347 U.S. 645, 652-54, 74 S.C. 826, 830-32, 98 L. Ed. 1015 (1954); <span class="Italic">Food Marketing Institute v.

Therefore, even if a labor arbitrator may properly disregard fact determinations made in other litigated proceedings, an issue we do not decide, a quasi-judicial <span id="Page_1550"></span>administrative body is not necessarily similarly situated. We believe the better rule is to permit the administrative agency to secure the same benefits from the doctrine of collateral estoppel as the courts find. Thus we agree with the holding of the Merit Systems Protection Board that it is entitled to employ the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of collateral estoppel can only preclude relitigation of those issues actually litigated and decided in an earlier proceeding.[10] A determination of which issues were litigated may not be immediately discernible when the antecedent criminal suit resulted in a general verdict of the jury or judgment of the court without special findings<span class="Italic">. See Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 340 U.S. 558, 569, 71 S.C. 408, 414, 95 L. Ed. 534 (1951). Accordingly, the Supreme Court has held that when a prior criminal judgment is sought to be used as an estoppel, the court must examine the record of the criminal proceeding, including the pleadings, evidence, jury instructions and other relevant matters in order to determine specifically what issues were decided<span class="Italic">. Ashe v. Swenson</span>, 397 U.S. 436, 444, 90 S.C. 1189, 1194, 25 L. Ed.2d 469 (1970) (collateral estoppel use of general verdict);[11] <span class="Italic">Emich Motors Corp. v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Ashe</span>, the Court incorporated collateral estoppel into the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. The court in which a criminal defendant is <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to use a judgment of acquittal must "conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant <span class="Italic">seek</span>s to foreclose from consideration." 397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.C. at 1194. On the other hand, collateral estoppel use of a criminal acquittal is invariably foreclosed in a subsequent civil suit because of the differing standards of proof. Thus a determination that the government did not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt will not preclude either the government or a private party from attempting to prove the same set of facts by a preponderance of the evidence<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case before us, the Board accorded conclusive weight to petitioner's criminal convictions based solely on the Judgment and Probation Commitment Orders. The Board could properly rely on the convictions only if the issue on which the Board sought to estop the petitioner was necessarily decided by those convictions<span class="Italic">. Emich Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 340 U.S. at 569, 71 S.C. at 414.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner was convicted of two charges. One conviction was under 18 USC &#x00A7; 13 (1976) and related to disorderly conduct under state law. It was not relied on by the Board to establish the facts to uphold petitioner's removal. The other conviction, which was the one relied on by the Board, was for violation of 18 USC &#x00A7; 113(d) (1976), which prohibits assault by "striking, beating, or wounding." The Board concluded that a conviction under section 113(d) provides that the defendant "must have made actual body contact with the assault victim, involving striking, beating, or wounding," citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Stewart</span>, 568 F.2d 501, 504-505 (6th Cir. 1978). It found that "the elements of the criminal charge of assault by striking, beating, or wounding are substantially identical to the agency's charge of shoving and striking, where the same incident was involved," and therefore concluded that the presiding official's failure to accord collateral estoppel effect to the criminal conviction was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner contends that because section 113(d) has been interpreted to be the "equivalent of simple battery" notwithstanding its use of the words "striking, beating or wounding," <span class="Italic">United States v. Knife</span>, 592 F.2d 472, 482 (8th Cir. 1979), it cannot be conclusively presumed from the Judgment and Probation Commitment Orders that his conviction established more than "the least touching." To support his position he notes that the case relied on by the Board for its construction of the statute also equated section 113(d) with simple battery and proceeded to quote with apparent approval Blackstone's definition of battery as "'The least touching of another's person wilfully, or in anger....'" <span class="Italic">United States v. Stewart</span>, 568 F.2d at 504-05, quoting 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120 (E. Christian ed. 1822).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's argument may reflect too narrow a view of the conduct for which he was convicted. If Lewis' testimony before the magistrate was substantially the same as the testimony she gave before the presiding official and there was no other testimony from which the magistrate could have concluded that "mere touching" occurred, then it would be a reasonable conclusion that the magistrate's judgment of conviction was based on his acceptance of Lewis' version of the incident. The Board would then have had sufficient basis to use the conviction to establish that petitioner struck Lewis and pushed her against some storage bins.[15] However, although Lewis stated before the presiding official that she had previously testified at the criminal proceeding, she was never asked the substance of her testimony. We are therefore uninformed of what acts furnished the foundation of the conviction on the charge of assault<span class="Italic">. Basista v. Weir</span>, 340 F.2d at 81-82. Missing from the record before the Board were the pleadings, transcript, if any, and exhibits, which the Supreme Court considered relevant in both <span class="Italic">Ashe</span> and <span class="Italic">Emich Motors</span>. The Commitment Orders indicate only that petitioner pleaded not guilty but that he was subsequently found guilty by a United States Magistrate and fined $50.00 on the assault and $25.00 on the disorderly conduct charge. At oral argument before us, neither counsel was able to provide further information. We have previously held that reasonable doubt as to which issues were decided by a prior judgment should be resolved against using such judgment as an estoppel<span class="Italic">. Kauffman v. Moss</span>, 420 F.2d at 1274. Therefore, unless the only evidence on which the magistrate could have relied to convict was evidence of striking and shoving, the application of estoppel in this case cannot be upheld.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;We intimate no view as to whether the Agency could have decided to dismiss petitioner based simply on a criminal conviction for assault of a co-employee at work except to note that this was not the basis on which the Agency in fact acted in this case<span class="Italic">. See SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 318 U.S. 80, 95, 63 S.C. 454, 462, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943) (agency action will only be upheld on basis articulated by agency).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since it is clear that the Board's reversal of the presiding official's determination was based solely on the application of collateral estoppel, we believe it appropriate to remand this matter to the Board so that it can ascertain whether the precise issue on which it <span class="Italic">seek</span>s to estop petitioner was in fact litigated and necessarily decided adversely to him<span class="Italic">. See Scooper Dooper, Inc. v. Kraftco Corp.</span>, 494 F.2d 840, (3d Cir. 1974); <span class="Italic">United States v. Friedland</span>, 391 F.2d 378, 382 (2d Cir. 1968), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 404 U.S. 914, 92 S.C. 239, 30 L. Ed.2d 188 (1971). The Agency, as the party <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to effectuate an estoppel, has the burden of demonstrating the propriety of its application<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. It may meet the burden of establishing which issues were litigated by introduction of the record of the criminal proceeding, including the transcript, or magistrate's opinion, if any. If that is not feasible, the Agency should be permitted to bring in extrinsic evidence so that a sufficient and adequate record of the proceeding may be developed<span class="Italic">. Basista v. Weir</span>, 340 F.2d at 82. This could include, for example, testimony about the earlier case by the magistrate, the court reporter, or witnesses<span class="Italic">. See Popp v. Eberlein</span>, 409 F.2d 309, 310 (7th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 396 U.S. 909, 90 S.C. 222, 24 L. Ed.2d 185 (1969); F. James &#x0026; G. Hazard, <span class="Italic">Civil Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 11.17, at 567 (2d ed. 1977). Thus, we conclude that while the Board is entitled to rely on the doctrine of collateral estoppel, its use of that doctrine must follow procedures similar to those established for its use in judicial proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency proof needed to secure collateral estoppel consists of evidence of the conviction, not supporting evidence (relevant only if the appellant challenges the procedures used to obtain the conviction). For the doctrine of <span id="Page_1551"></span>collateral estoppel to apply through a judgment of conviction, the proof that the issues involved in the criminal case are the same as those in the Board case must consist of information contained in the judgment or order, or extrinsic evidence about the case from the judge, a court reporter (by testimony or transcript), or witnesses. The judgment itself, if it only recites a conviction and mentions no evidence or statutes violated, is not sufficient to collaterally estop the appellant from contesting charges before the Board. <span class="Italic">Ratley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 13 MSPR 316, 319 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Miles v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 102 MSPR 316, 320 &#x00B6; 10, 2006 MSPB 169 (2006) ("The issue in the present appeal, whether the appellant engaged in the alleged misconduct, was identical to that in the criminal proceedings and was actually litigated in the criminal proceedings. Also, the determination on the issue was necessary to the resulting criminal conviction, and the appellant, as a party to the criminal case who was represented by counsel, had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 19."). The evidence of conviction must show the charges resulting in the conviction. A document stating only that the employee was found guilty does not explain the charge or the basis for the judgment of guilt. The Board may permit evidence of the testimony accompanying the guilty plea to provide further explanation of precisely what conduct the appellant intended to include in the plea. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 224, 227 (1988); <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. DLA</span>, 21 MSPR 99, 103 (1984) (permitting testimony, i.e., hearsay, rather than court papers to demonstrate that a criminal conviction involved the conduct covered by an adverse action charge).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board examines the basis of a criminal conviction and compares the conviction with the charges leading to the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Owens v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 63, 67 (1993), set aside an AJ's application of collateral estoppel when the appellant's removal was based on a charge that he concealed, opened, and possessed registered mail, but the criminal conviction was based on a finding that the appellant concealed and possessed registered mail. Because opening the mail was an essential part of the adverse action, but not an essential component of the conviction, identity of issues was lacking and collateral estoppel was precluded. The appeal was remanded to the AJ for a hearing on the evidence relating to the charge that the appellant improperly opened mail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Collateral estoppel precludes the Board appeal from being used to challenge the basis for the conviction, <span class="Italic">Agnew v. USPS</span>, NY-0353-14-0337-I-1 (NP 12/22/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant attempts to relitigate his criminal conviction. For example, he alleges that PIS officials lied or improperly provided personal opinions to the grand jury. He also argues that the PIS improperly listened in on his phone conversations during its investigation, without a proper warrant. He further claims that the jury was not provided all material evidence, and he never intended to commit any wrongdoing. However, he has not presented any basis for disturbing the administrative judge's application of collateral estoppel, and we are aware of none. <span class="Italic">See Miles v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 316, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (recognizing that collateral estoppel is properly applied to preclude an appellant who has been convicted of a criminal offense from relitigating whether he committed the charged conduct in an adverse action appeal when the alleged misconduct is identical to that in the criminal proceedings). We agree with the administrative judge; the appellant is precluded from relitigating the charges underlying his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A criminal proceeding permits the application of collateral estoppel, despite differences in standards of proof (e.g., relative to intent) between criminal and civil proceedings, as long as the requisite due process criteria were met. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Curry v.

VA</span>, DC-0752-16-0350-I-3 (NP 2/27/2023) (Virginia law controlled application of collateral estoppel, and state law required "mutuality" for estoppel to operate: "The agency would not have been bound by the opposite result--a not guilty verdict in Virginia Circuit Court--so it may not invoke the preclusive force of the appellant's conviction.").</p>
