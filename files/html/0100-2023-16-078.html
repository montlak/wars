<p class="noindent">"[T]he Authority consistently finds that there can be no binding practice that requires the performance of an unlawful or illegal act." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 60 FLRA 20, 24 (2004), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 60 FLRA 140 (2004); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps and AFGE Local 1881</span>, 34 FLRA 635, 638 (1990) (no ULP when management discontinued practice established <span id="Page_1317"></span>by memo of agreement that it paid for safety vests used by employees riding motorcycles to work; use of vehicles was not for agency business and decisions of the Comptroller General precluded reimbursement of employees' personal expenses for safety equipment). If management discovers that one of its personnel practices is unlawful, e.g., payment of premium pay, it may terminate that past practice without delay and it need not bargain over the decision to terminate the practice. Although management may be required to correct an unlawful practice once discovered, there is an obligation to give notice of the change and, upon request, bargain to the extent consonant with law and regulation concerning the impact of the required change and, if possible, concerning its implementation. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey Conservation Div. and AFGE Local 3457</span>, 9 FLRA 543, 544-45 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, National Park Service and FOP, Park Police Committee</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-212.html">71 FLRA 1121</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (arbitration award permitting officers to avoid paying fines for traffic or parking offenses while they used GOVs was contrary to GSA government-wide regulations imposing personal responsibility, with exceptions, for payment; an arguable past practice of not requiring payments did not cure the violation of the contrary regulation) (recon. den., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-19.html">72 FLRA 103</a> (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has long held that an agency may implement a change to correct an unlawful practice without first bargaining over the change.[22] In that circumstance, an agency is obligated to provide notice of the change and provide an opportunity to bargain only <span class="Italic">after</span> implementation.[23]...</p>

In fact, in order to prevent any such misapprehension of its holding, the Authority in <span class="Italic">Interior</span> provided the following qualification: "This is not to suggest that the obligation to bargain over the impact of a decision to discontinue an unlawful past practice could justify a delay in correcting the unlawful past practice." 9 FLRA at 546 n.9. Thus, <span class="Italic">Interior</span> undercuts, rather than supports, the dissent.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that reducing the M&#x0026;IE rates was mandated by law, and that the Agency was, therefore, required to immediately correct the "unlawful past practice[&#8197;]."[57] Specifically, the Agency argues that the FTR provides that agencies "[m]ust limit the authorization and payment of travel expenses to travel that is necessary to accomplish [their] mission[s] in the most economical and effective manner, under rules stated throughout th[e FTR]."[58] Thus, the Agency appears to argue that an agency is required to pay a reduced per diem rate whenever it "determine[s] in advance that lodging and/or meal costs will be lower than the per diem rate."[59]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">But it is a basic rule of statutory (or in this case regulatory) construction that a general command should not be interpreted to override a specific one.[60] Here, although the FTR contains a general command to use travel funds prudently, with regard to the specific issue of reduced per diems, the FTR expressly provides that an agency "<span class="Italic">may</span>...prescribe a reduced per diem rate lower than the prescribed maximum" when it determines that subsistence expenses will be less than the maximum authorized rate.[61] Further, the GSA's Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) has observed that "[t]he FTR gives an agency the <span class="Italic">discretion</span> to pay a reduced per diem rate when it determines in advance of the temporary duty that lodging and/or meal costs will be lower than the maximum per diem rate."[62] And, as the issuing agency, the GSA is entitled to deference in interpreting the FTR.[63]</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA summed up its position on alteration of unlawful past pay practices when it reviewed an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1367 and Dept. of Air Force, Lackland AFB,</span> 63 FLRA 655, 656-57 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency is required to fulfill its obligation to bargain in good faith before changing conditions of employment, which may be established by past practice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Nat'I Council of HUD Locals 222,</span> AFL-CIO, 60 FLRA 311, 314 (2004) (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Bd. of Immigration Appeals,</span> 55 FLRA 454, 456-57 (1999) (Member Wasserman concurring; Member Cabaniss dissenting on other grounds) (<span class="Italic">EOIR</span>)); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.,</span> 19 FLRA 136, 149-50 (1985) (adopting administrative law judge's decision that agency's past practice of granting routine overtime could not be terminated absent bargaining over the impact and implementation of the change). An agency violates its obligation to bargain in good faith when it changes a past practice prior to the completion of bargaining. <span class="Italic">EOIR,</span> 55 FLRA at 456.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no dispute that the policy set forth in the memorandum constituted a past practice. Further, there is no dispute that the Agency provided the Union with notice of the proposed termination of the practice and an opportunity to submit proposals regarding the impact and implementation of the termination. It is similarly undisputed that the Union failed to submit any proposals to the Agency. Accordingly, there is no evidence that the Agency failed to bargain in good faith prior to terminating the practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument regarding the legality of the practice is inapposite: the legality of a past practice concerns only <span class="Italic">when</span>--and not <span class="Italic">whether</span>--an agency may change the practice. In this respect, there are limited circumstances where an agency does not violate its duty to bargain in good faith by changing the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>prior to the completion of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See United States INS, Wash., D.C.,</span> 55 FLRA 69, 73 n.8 (1999) (Member Wasserman dissenting) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>). As relevant here, an agency may lawfully implement changes when necessary to correct an unlawful practice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted). In this regard, an agency that implements a change in order to correct an unlawful practice is only obligated to bargain <span class="Italic">after</span> implementation over the impact and implementation of the change. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted). Thus, contrary to the Union's claim that the past practice could only be terminated if the practice was illegal, Authority precedent establishes that the legality of a past practice concerns only whether an agency is authorized to implement a proposed change to the practice prior to completing impact and implementation bargaining with a union. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> As such, the Union's claim does not establish that the award is deficient. Further, having found that the Agency provided the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over the impact and implementation of the termination of the practice prior to implementation, and that the Union waived the opportunity to bargain by failing to submit proposals, the Arbitrator was correct in finding that it was unnecessary for him to determine whether the practice was illegal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the cases cited by the Union fail to establish that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law. In this respect, neither of the cases cited by the Union establish that the Agency did not have the right to terminate the past practice after providing the Union with notice and an opportunity to engage in impact and implementation bargaining. In this regard, the Supreme Court case is a private sector case that does not concern an agency's obligations under the Statute when changing a past practice. The Authority case cited by the Union merely sets forth the definition of a past practice. As there is no dispute that the policy set forth in the memorandum constituted a past practice, this case similarly provides no basis for overturning the Arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although management need not bargain over a change in pay practice that it is required to make by law, <span class="Italic">Nat'l Bureau of Standards, Boulder Lab., Plant Div. 283.00 and AFGE Local 2186</span>, 5 FLRA 823 (1981) (ALJ Decision), there must be impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA OHA, Falls Church</span>, 60 FLRA 461, 466 (2004) ("[T]he Agency may make changes to existing practices that are illegal, but it must fulfill its obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of the changes."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., New Orleans <span id="Page_1318"></span>and NTEU Chap. 168</span>, 38 FLRA 163, 174 (1990) (same rule when management maintains that contract article unlawfully provides benefit that management seeks to discontinue). Management's claim that the practice (relating to payment and leave of certain employees) was illegal and nonnegotiable under previous law granted no defense to a unilateral change. However, FLRA noted that "any agreed upon pay practice must be consonant with appropriate law and regulation." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 4</span>, 5 FLRA 352, 353 (1981). But a court suggested that, for there to be a past practice that creates an obligation to bargain over a decision to change that practice, management cannot have established a practice contrary to government-wide regulations. If the past practice is contrary to law, management may change it without bargaining over the decision to make the change. <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 727 F.2d 481, 489-90 (5th Cir. 1984) (reversing ULP determination as to changes in practice involving private vehicle use determined by the court to contravene GSA regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent">The rule seems clear enough now that, impact bargaining aside, if an agency changes its leave policy and practices to conform with OPM regulations established in the late FPM Chapter 630, considered a government-wide regulation, the agency does not commit a ULP by making the change without providing the union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over the changes. There was no obligation to bargain over the decision to change a past practice to conform with the requirement of law and regulation. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and NFFE Local 1991</span>, 20 FLRA 587, 583 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Portsmouth FEMTC</span>, 49 FLRA 1522, 1527-31 (1994) (no obligation to bargain change in issuance of permits for drivers of commercial vehicles without regard to whether those drivers hold valid state commercial drivers' licenses; change was required by federal law; no obligation to bargain over decision to change an unlawful past practice). If past payment for a duty-free lunch break was contrary to law, there was no duty for the agency to negotiate as to discontinuation of that payment; there was, however, a duty to bargain over the impact of the change. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 17 FLRA 394, 394-95 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although impact bargaining may be required, action by an agency to correct a prior illegal practice may not be delayed by the obligation of the agency to bargain over the impact and implementation of a decision to change the practice. <span class="Italic">Region III, SSA and AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Operations Locals</span>, 17 FLRA 959, 962 (1985). The rule that management need not bargain over the decision to change a practice that is contrary to law extends to changes of conditions that are legally not properly defined as conditions of employment and that are, as a consequence, beyond the scope of bargaining. <span class="Italic">DOD, Ft. Buchanan, San Juan and AFGE Local 2614</span>, 24 FLRA 971, 971-76 (1986). On the theory that it is not a ULP for management unilaterally to change a past practice regarding procedures to select supervisors, FLRA dismissed a ULP complaint that the agency unilaterally changed a practice permitting union representatives to pursue agency administrative grievances on behalf of unsuccessful candidates for supervisory jobs. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region VI and NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 18 FLRA 1, 4 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it was within management's rights to change, without bargaining, the manner that notice would be provided by employees of their breaks, impact bargaining was required because of the potential for discipline if notification requirements were not followed by employees. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 3342</span>, 34 FLRA 765, 769-71 (1990). An agency legitimately changed without bargaining a past practice of establishing strict overtime rosters. The creation of rosters precluding management from making overtime assignments to groups of employees was an infringement on the right to assign work and could be changed without bargaining the decision. <span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv. and AFGE Local 3157</span>, 18 FLRA 119, 121 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">If management changes past practices or refuses to follow a contract provision because that the practice or provision is contrary to law, and if it rests its actions on a modification in FLRA case law, it takes the risk that FLRA's decisions may change or be changed by either a court decision or a subsequent FLRA decision. A ULP complaint is decided on the basis of the law as it exists when the case is before FLRA. Subsequent legal developments have retrospective legal effects. <span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr. and FUSE, NAGE, Local R1-144</span>, 30 FLRA 697, 700-01 (1987). Management also risks, when it relies on the concept of illegality, the possibility that its judgment is wrong. In <span class="Italic">GPO and Joint Council of Unions, GPO</span>, 13 FLRA 203 (1983) (ALJ Decision), the agency discontinued the practice of supplying water coolers in the office, explaining to FLRA that a series of decisions of the Comptroller General forbade the expenditure unless it was "reasonably necessary" for the government. FLRA dismissed the argument, for the necessity could be established through negotiations of the parties. In <span class="Italic">GSA Nat'l Capital Region and AFGE Local 1733</span>, 50 FLRA 728, 732-33, 737 (1995) (ALJ Decision) (<span class="Italic">enforcement denied</span>, <span class="Italic">GSA v. FLRA</span>, 86 F.3d 1185, 1187-88 (D.C. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">post</span>), management committed a ULP when it acted mistakenly, but in good faith, and changed a workplace practice based on management's conclusion that the practice, involving transportation and storage of firearms by its employees, was illegal. Over the dissent of Member Armendariz, FLRA declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency changes a condition of employment of bargaining unit employees, it is obligated to notify and negotiate with the collective bargaining representative prior to effectuating the change<span class="Italic">. Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>,<span class="Italic"> Portsmouth, New Hampshire</span>, 49 FLRA 1522, 1527 (1994). There is no obligation to bargain over a decision to change a past practice which is unlawful. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1527-28.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge, however, did not conclude that the Agency's practice of permitting the police officers to carry their weapons between their residences and duty stations was illegal. Instead, the Judge concluded that the Agency had made a reasonable determination, in good faith, that the practice probably was illegal. However, whether an agency acts in good faith is irrelevant in determining whether a change is unlawful. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 33 FLRA 196, 202 (1988). It is well established that when an agency changes conditions of employment and refuses to bargain with the union concerning those changes, the agency acts at its peril. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and SSA, Hartford District Office, Hartford, Connecticut and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1164</span>, 41 FLRA 1309, 1317 (1991). Thus, the Judge erred in determining that the Agency's showing of possible illegality of the Agency's practice was sufficient to conclude that the Agency did not violate the Statute by unilaterally changing its practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the record does not establish that the Agency's practice was illegal. First, the two cases the Judge relied on...are entirely distinguishable from the Agency's practice at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Judge erred by relying on the Agency's good faith and by failing to make a determination of the illegality of the Agency's practice. Moreover, while acknowledging the Respondent's apparent good faith reliance on, among other things, a 1972 DOJ Opinion, we are compelled to conclude that the record before us does not establish the illegality of the practice. Accordingly, the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by changing its past practice of permitting the officers to carry their weapons between their homes and duty stations without notifying and bargaining with the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent">On review, the D.C. Circuit decided that FLRA improperly substituted its discretion for that of GSA as to the authority of employees to carry weapons between their worksite and their homes, <span class="Italic">GSA v. FLRA</span>, 86 F.3d 1185, 1187-88 (D.C. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that if the practice of FPS officers carrying guns home was illegal GSA is not obliged to bargain with the union over the decision to return to the pre-Gulf War situation. Whether such a practice is illegal depends on the Administrator's determination as to whether firearms are appropriately carried home by the officers "in the discharge of [his] duties" and, thereby, their duties. That determination is not purely discretionary; the government contends that the Administrator could not legally permit the officers to carry guns home absent an emergency such as the Gulf War. Still, the Authority is obviously uncomfortable in recognizing the Administrator's power to erect a legal barrier around a decision relating to the officers' duties, concerning which the union would normally wish to bargain. Accordingly, the FLRA refused to defer to the government's interpretation of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But it is clear that Congress intended that FPS officers would be permitted to carry firearms (a rather sensitive matter) only insofar, in OLC's words, as the Administrator deemed it "necessary or reasonably related to the performance of their official duties." In the absence of that determination, an officer carrying a gun would violate D.C. criminal law. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Middleton v. United States</span>, 305 A.2d 259, 261-62 (D.C. App. 1973). The Authority, apparently recognizing how thin is the ice on which it is skating, did not presume to conclude that the practice was legal; it somewhat illogically--particularly in light of its criticism of the ALJ--declined to accept the government's interpretation and put the matter to bargaining, sidestepping the legal question. That course, however, could lead to a bargaining impasse, which would be resolved by an impasse panel determination as to whether officers could carry guns home. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d 1497, 1500-01 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Such an outcome would be inconsistent with congressional intent that it be the Administrator's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This situation is far removed from <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services v. FLRA</span>, 920 F.2d 45 (D.C. Cir. 1990), upon which the Authority relies. In that case we held that the Authority, not an agency, was entitled to deference as to "the compelling need" for, and consequent nonnegotiability of, a regulation. That was because the term "compelling need" is in the FLRA's statute and the Authority was directed by Congress to issue a regulation defining it. This statute, by contrast, is administered by GSA and it is to GSA, not the FLRA, we must look for its meaning. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 30 F.3d 1510, 1514 (D.C. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 1449, 1452 (D.C. Cir. 1990). So should have the FLRA which, perforce, must grant an agency the same deference to its interpretation of an authorizing statute that we would.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1319"></span>The manner in which GSA offered its interpretation, contrary to the Authority's argument, does not militate against deference. To be sure, the Administrator did not issue a regulation setting forth his interpretation nor was there any administrative "adjudication" of the issue. But on such a question--a legal interpretation of a statute governing practices of employees--there really is no occasion or need for the agency to adopt either procedure. We will defer to an agency's interpretation of its statute even if proffered outside administrative adjudication or rulemaking so long as we are assured it is the "official interpretation." We have even deferred to "agency counsel's litigative positions" where we were certain that they did not differ from the agency's. <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 884 F.2d 1446, 1455 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 1055, 110 S. Ct. 863, 864, 107 L. Ed.2d 947, 948 (1990); <span class="Italic">Women Involved in Farm Economics v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 876 F.2d 994, 998-1000 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 1019, 110 S. Ct. 717, 107 L. Ed.2d 737 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Once it is determined to whom deference is owed, there is not a good deal left to this case," because the statute does not demarcate the outer bounds of the firearms authorization, and we "must therefore defer to any reasonable interpretation or application of it." <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Serv.</span>, 920 F.2d at 48. The agency's 1993 memorandum returned its FPS firearm policy to the general rule it had followed with only one interruption since 1972. The 1972 and 1978 opinions pointed out that D.C. courts have not been inclined generously to read exemptions to the District's gun prohibitions for officers like FPS.<span class="Italic">' See Middleton</span>, 305 A.2d 259; <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. United States</span>, 158 A.2d 912 (D.C. App. 1960). GSA reasonably rejects the Authority's suggestion that the officers' expanded duties and new title might justify home carriage as duty-related. Their authority remains limited to discrete locations and because they have no authority elsewhere, they have no duty-related reason, absent exceptional circumstances, to carry weapons elsewhere.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We, therefore, do not see how GSA's abandonment of its Gulf War practice that extended beyond that emergency can be challenged. The FLRA faults GSA's 1993 memorandum for failing explicitly to consider whether changed circumstances brought present-day home carriage into one of the exceptions to the prohibition set forth in OLC's opinion. Since FPS officers are now subject to immediate recall (due to a shortage of officers), it is argued, the exception for "a riot situation when [officers] might be subject to special call to places not ascertainable in advance" might apply. And, since officers are no longer assigned to one building or property, home carriage might be permitted because "some officers are assigned to different and widely separated buildings over different days." These "suggestions" exceed the Authority's writ. It is the Administrator who has the responsibility of determining when the officers' duties dictate gun carriage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, GSA reasonably interpreted its statute and it cannot be forced to bargain over the discontinuation of home carriage. On remand, it remains open whether GSA must negotiate over its impact and implementation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the Authority determined that discontinuation of the practice of permitting officers to carry their weapons between work and home was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. A prospective bargaining order was entered. <span class="Italic">GSA, Nat'l Capital Region and AFGE Local 1733</span>, 52 FLRA 563, 566 (1996).</p>
