<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-232"><span class="space">3.</span> Extension of Stay</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 68 MSPR 266, 268-69 (1995), explained the nature of the Board's authority to extend a stay granted to OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(B), a statute enacted as part of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, the Board may grant extensions of stays at its discretion while viewing the record in the light most favorable to the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 44 MSPR 544, 545-46 (1990). The use of the term "may" in the statute demonstrates that the Board must exercise its discretion in determining whether the stay should be extended. Under this standard, the Board will grant the Special Counsel's request for an extension if the Special Counsel's prohibited personnel practice claim is not clearly unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This standard is consistent with the legislative history, which shows that Congress intended to make it easier for the Special Counsel to obtain a stay under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Tines v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 510, 511 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 5 (2005), noted that, "In evaluating a request for an extension of a stay, the Board will view the record in a light most favorable to OSC and will grant an extension provided OSC's prohibited personnel practice claim is not clearly unreasonable," adding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed comments with evidentiary support in opposition to OSC's request for an extension of the stay. The agency asserts that the Board should not grant the extension because OSC's factual assertions fail to show that it has a reasonable basis for believing that the agency has engaged in a prohibited personnel practice. A stay proceeding is not intended to be a substitute for a complete hearing on the merits of a prohibited personnel practice claim. <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel ex rel.</span> <span class="Italic">Finkel v. Department of Labor,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 409 &#x00B6; 11 (2003). OSC's stay request need merely fall within the range of rationality to be granted. <span class="Italic">Office of Special Counsel, ex rel. Hopkins v. Department of Transportation</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 154 &#x00B6; 6 (2001). The Board reviews the facts as alleged by OSC in the light most favorable to a finding that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice was (or will be) committed. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Rigdon v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 110 &#x00B6; 2 n.1 (2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Cefalu v. DOJ</span>, CB-1208-13-0006-U-2 (NP 12/6/2012) ("A stay proceeding is not intended to be a substitute for a complete hearing on the merits of a prohibited personnel practice claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 157. OSC's stay request need merely fall within the range of rationality to be granted. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Tines v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). Given the points and authorities set forth by OSC, we cannot say that its prohibited personnel practice theory is irrational or clearly unreasonable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">During a stay, the employee for whom the stay is granted is expected to conform to ordinary workplace standards, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Klein v. VA</span>, CB-1208-16-0023-U-7 (NP 7/13/2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although OSC's request for an extension is being granted, nothing in this order, or any prior order in this matter, should be interpreted as authorizing Dr. Klein to refuse to comply with a lawful instruction to return to work. Dr. Klein's return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> does not invest him with any special rights to dictate or unilaterally change the terms of his employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Missal v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">At present, there is only one Board member and the Board lacks a quorum. Thus, the Board lacks the authority to act upon OSC's request for an extension of the stay. However, Congress has recently passed legislation amending 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214 to allow an individual Board member to extend a stay granted under section 1214(b)(1)(A) during periods when the Board lacks a quorum. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. 1083 115th Cong. (as passed by the House of Representatives on May 25, 2017, and by the Senate on June 14, 2017). The Vice Chairman has publicly stated support for this legislation and has so informed the White House Office of Policy Development and the Office of Management and Budget of this support. There does not appear to be any opposition to the legislation's enactment. Following the enactment of this legislation, OSC again can petition the Board for an extension of the previously granted stay. Given the unusual circumstances present in this case and the fact that the Board has been without a quorum since January 7, 2017, should OSC request an extension of the stay following enactment of the pending legislation, OSC also may include a request that the stay be granted retroactive to May 13, 2017.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The bill referenced in <span class="Italic">Klein</span> was enacted on June 27, 2017, Pub. L. 115-42:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Board regulations at 5 CFR 1201.136(b) (2022) contemplate that an extension be requested at least fifteen days before the expiration of a stay and that an agency response be "received by the Board no later than 8 days before the expiration date of the stay." The Board suggests facsimile filing of the response to permit adequate time for its consideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

The regulations are not closely followed in practice. The Board will grant a belated request for a stay extension, on motion for the extension of the filing deadline, or without the motion for the filing deadline extension when the respondent agency does not oppose the extension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel.

In light of the factors discussed above, a 45-day extension of the stay is appropriate; thus, OSC's request is granted in part.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An extension is normally granted, even if granted for a period longer or shorter than that requested by OSC. The length of a requested extension of a stay requires a separate Board determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. IRS</span>, 67 MSPR 175, 176-77 (1995). The proper length of a stay extension is based on the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

Customs Serv.</span>, 31 MSPR 568, 570 (1986) (agency argument concerning the strength of an OSC case was premature relative to a request to extend a stay; the investigation was, as yet, incomplete). A stipulation between OSC and a respondent amounting to a consented extension will be considered by, but does not bind, the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 92, 96 &#x00B6; 11 (2000); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. SBA</span>, 73 MSPR 261, 263 (1997).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite our approval of OSC's request, we note that five of its eight requests for an extension of the stay in this matter have been premised on progress toward a negotiated settlement. We further note that the two extension requests preceding the present one have been for 21 days each, and that the present request asks for only an additional 14 days. It does not serve the efficiency of the adjudicative process for the parties and the Board to be spending excessive amounts of time and effort determining the duration of the stay. We strongly urge OSC to be as realistic as possible in the future in its assessment of the probability and timing of reaching negotiated settlements, and of the length of time that is reasonably required for an extension of a stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reiterate the observation we made in granting OSC's fourth extension request--that stays should not extend for prolonged periods of time, and that OSC should proceed with a corrective action case in a timely manner after it has secured a stay<span class="Italic">. See Special Counsel ex rel Shaw v. Social Security Administration</span>, 77 MSPR 301, 304 (1998); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. U.S. Fish &#x0026; Wildlife</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 64 MSPR 413, 415 (1994). The stay in this matter has been in effect for almost eight months. Although the Board of course encourages settlement agreements in matters that come before it, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 72 MSPR 62, 64 (1996), it is time for this matter to be either settled or proceed to the filing of a petition for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board occasionally tweaks OSC by slightly reducing an extension with the result that OSC is reminded of the need to produce a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> explanation for an extension request, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. IRS</span>, 66 MSPR 26, 28 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The length of the requested extension, however, is not supported by the request. While OSC asserts that a 60-day extension is necessary, in the event negotiations fail, to complete its investigation, write an investigative report, conduct a legal analysis, analyze the evidence and determine if further action is warranted, OSC's request for its first extension was based, as set out above, on similar reasons. Absent a more precise explanation of what remains to be done to complete OSC's investigation, we agree with the agency that the period of time requested for the extension is too long. Furthermore, the agency has asserted that OSC need not discontinue its investigation during negotiations. In view of the intent of Congress that stays not be extended for long periods of time and that the Special Counsel present any corrective action in a timely manner, we believe that an extension of 45-days is appropriate in this case....</p>

General Services Administration</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 601, 605 (1990).

<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, this stay has been in effect since October 23, 2012, and has been extended continuously since that time pursuant to four separate extension requests from OSC, each of which the Board granted. Under the terms of the Board's most recent stay extension order, this stay will expire after June 19, 2013--nearly 8 months after it began. We think that that is long enough for OSC to decide whether it is going to pursue corrective action in this case, and we find that any further extension would be inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(B). Stays under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1) were not meant to be extended for prolonged periods of time, and the Board has an obligation to press OSC to present any corrective action case in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

We understand that OSC is still contemplating the Department of Justice's 9-page memorandum of May 21, 2013. However, OSC has not described what issues the memorandum raised that require 2 additional weeks to consider. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. U.S. Fish &#x0026; Wildlife Service</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 413, 415-16 (1994) (denying the Special Counsel's request for a stay extension because, among other things, she failed to provide the details of the newly-discovered information underlying the request). Indeed, OSC seems already to have taken the position that this case hinges on a "narrow legal issue" and that the additional issues raised in the May <span id="Page_4059"></span>21 memorandum are "peripheral" at best. For these reasons, we will not stay this personnel action any further unless and until OSC decides to pursue corrective action. At that point, we will revisit the matter if OSC so requests.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 1214(b)(1)(B), a statute newly enacted as part of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, the Board "may" extend a stay issued by a single Member "for any period which the Board considers appropriate."

The use of the term "may" in the statute demonstrates that the Board must exercise its discretion in determining whether the stay should be extended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;because the Board is no longer required to concur in the Special Counsel's reasonable grounds determination, the case law developed under that provision is no longer directly applicable to requests for extensions of stays....</p>

OSC submits a copy of its report to the Secretary and requests a 60-day extension of the stay to provide the agency with time to consider OSC's request and afford OSC time to petition the Board for corrective action if the agency does not take appropriate action. OSC has indicated that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(C), the Secretary is entitled to a reasonable period of time to correct the prohibited personnel practice, and that OSC has asked the Secretary to respond to the report within 30 days. The agency does not oppose OSC's request for an extension of the stay but asserts that by not opposing the stay it does not admit or concede any findings or conclusions set forth in OSC's report.</p>

Nevertheless, because a response to OSC's report should be forthcoming within 30 days of November 1, 2011, we find that OSC and the agency are being given ample time with this 60-day extension to either resolve this matter or have OSC file a petition for corrective action. In this regard, we note that the agency is only entitled to a "reasonable period of time" to correct a prohibited personnel practice before OSC may petition the Board for corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(C).

<p class="Body-Text">In making its decision to grant or deny an extension of a stay sought by OSC, the Board may consider evidence from the respondent agency concerning the conduct of OSC's investigation.

<p class="Body-Text">If a stay is requested to permit the agency to take corrective action and the agency quickly declines to correct its action, the Board may grant a shorter extension to permit OSC an opportunity to file its corrective action request with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 216, 218 (1993). <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 66 MSPR 176, 179 (1995), granting a 90-day extension, held: "Despite the fact that OSC has completed its investigation, it is appropriate to extend the stay while OSC attempts to secure corrective action from the agency, and, if necessary to present its case to the Board.... Further, protection of the employee pending consideration of allegations of prohibited personnel practices override considerations of agency efficiency and managerial discretion."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should OSC request an extension of a stay to consider filing a request for corrective action, and should the Board consider the time requested too long, the Board will substitute a shorter extension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

In view of our obligation to press the Special Counsel to seek corrective action in a timely manner, we believe that an extension of 30 days is appropriate[.]"). Protestations of overwork by OSC may not be sufficient to justify repeated and extended stays. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

As the affidavit of OSC's attorney suggests, much of the requested extension would be spent working on other cases.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined an indefinite extension of a stay, allowing 60 days for OSC to determine if it needed to pursue corrective action, absent settlement, in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DHUD</span>, 111 MSPR 48, 52-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will grant OSC's request for an extension if OSC's prohibited personnel practice claim is not clearly unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel.

OSC's original request for a stay was based on its allegation that DHUD failed to appoint Meyers to the Boise Field Office Director position because of his status as a Schedule C political appointee, a nonmerit factor, and therefore committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12). Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the Acting Special Counsel, we find that OSC's prohibited personnel practice claim is not clearly unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Beam v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 469, 475-77 (1995) (recognizing that Schedule C status is a nonmerit factor). Under the specific circumstances of this case and in light of the fact that the evidentiary record supporting OSC's initial stay request has not changed significantly since the stay went into effect by operation of law, a further stay is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A separate determination must be made on the length of the requested stay. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel ex rel. Waddell,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 5.

Waddell,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 3. Here, we find that an indefinite extension of the stay is not appropriate. As stated above, OSC has not yet filed a petition for corrective action. It is the intent of Congress that stays not be extended for prolonged periods of time. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

Special Counsel v. Department of the Interior,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 537, 538 (1995) (an indefinite extension of a stay pending resolution of the petition for corrective action that OSC filed is appropriate). In view of this obligation, and considering further the fact that the agency's response to OSC's request for voluntary corrective action is due before April 4, 2009, we believe that an extension of 60 days provides adequate time for OSC to review the agency's response and file a corrective action petition with the Board if OSC deems such action necessary. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied a stay extension when OSC took too long to decide how to handle a case, or when OSC's proof was plainly inadequate, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Fish &#x0026; Wildlife Serv.</span>, 64 MSPR 413, 415-16 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the stay extension request in this case is clearly unreasonable. The Special Counsel's request is based on bare allegations. Although she asserts that the investigation has revealed a potential 2302(b)(1) violation which may change the course of action taken by the Special Counsel, there are no details of the newly-discovered evidence nor any reasons given why it could not have been found much earlier in this investigation. The Special Counsel has had this complaint for over ten months and this is the fourth request for an extension of the initial stay. As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">FEMA</span>, "[i]t is the intent of Congress that stays not be extended 'for prolonged periods of time.'... Moreover, Congress has encouraged the Board to press the Special Counsel to present any corrective action case in a timely manner." 44 MSPR at 546-47, <span class="Italic">citing</span> H.R. Rep.

Although we must view the record in the light most favorable to the Special Counsel, extensions are not given on demand as they must be supported by sufficient facts to justify the request. Because there is no showing here as to the validity of the newly-discovered evidence nor why it was not discovered much earlier as well as the fact that substantial delays have been incurred, we can find no basis for further extensions in this case.</p>
