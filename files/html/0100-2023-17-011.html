<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-12"><span class="space">1.</span> Accuracy of Position Description</h4>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may direct that the agency provide an accurate position description to an appellant if the award does not intrude upon the authority of the agency to classify positions, <span class="Italic">DOD, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany and AFGE Local 22</span>, 57 FLRA 275, 277-78 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. The Authority has recognized that a grievance concerning the accuracy of an employee's official PD, such as a grievance about whether duties are accurately reflected in a PD, is not a grievance concerning classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), even if an arbitrator's award to change the PD results in a reclassification of the position. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 547,</span> 19 FLRA at 1178-79; <span class="Italic">VA, Regional Office, Winston-Salem, N.C., </span>16 FLRA 50, 51 (1984) (<span class="Italic">VA, Winston-Salem</span>); <span class="Italic">FAA, Dep't of Transp., Tampa, Fla., </span>8 FLRA 532, 535 n.3 (1982). However, the Authority has also held that when the essential nature of a grievance is integrally related to the accuracy of the classification of the grievant's position, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, where the substance of the dispute concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Med. Ctr., Muskogee, Okla., </span>47 FLRA 1112, 1116 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievants, in seeking accurate PDs, did not request a change in the series, grade, or pay system of their officially assigned positions. Likewise, the Arbitrator did not order any change in the class, grade, or pay system of the grievants' positions, or find that implementation of the proposed PD would result in the grievants' positions being classified at a higher grade level. The Arbitrator merely enforced the grievants' contractual right to have their positions current and accurately described, in writing....&#8197;The enforcement of that contractual right does not affect the Agency's ability to assign, or not assign, work to any particular position, and as such, does not give rise to a classification issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 547 </span>is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 547,</span> the arbitrator awarded the grievant a retroactive promotion for a period of time ending with a reclassification action and considered the grade level of the duties performed by the grievant in ordering the agency to give the grievant a higher-graded PD. Here, by contrast, the grievants did not request, and the Arbitrator did not award, a promotion. Further, the Arbitrator did not consider or refer to the grade level of the duties he found that the grievants performed in awarding an accurate PD. As such, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 547 </span>does not support a conclusion that the grievance concerns classification, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the substance of the grievance concerns whether the duties regularly assigned by management and performed by the grievants were accurately reflected in the PD, the fact that the award may result in the reclassification of the grievants' positions does not render this a dispute concerning classification. <span class="Italic">See VA,</span> <span class="Italic">Winston Salem, </span>16 FLRA at 51. As such, the award does not concern the classification of a position and, therefore, is not deficient as contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The award does not affect management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a party files exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the rights. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Med. Ctr., Coatesville, Pa., </span>56 FLRA 966, 971 (2000) (<span class="Italic">VAMC, Coatesville</span>).

<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Right to determine organization</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to determine its organization includes the authority to determine how its organizational grade-level structure will be designed<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1336, </span>52 FLRA 794, 802-03 (1996). As stated in section V.A. above, the award does not require the Agency to increase <span id="page_1677"></span>the grade level of the grievants' positions, and the Arbitrator did not find that implementation of the award would result in a reclassification of the grievants' positions. As such, the award does not affect the Agency's right to determine its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Right to assign work</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that PDs are not themselves the assignment of work; they merely reflect the duties and responsibilities which an agency has decided to assign a position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., State of Conn.,</span> <span class="Italic">AG Office, </span>27 FLRA 801, 807 (1987). The Agency has not established that the award prohibits it from changing the duties of the grievants by removing a duty from the PD if the grievants are not performing the particular duty. Therefore, the award does not affect the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1999, </span>2 FLRA 153, 160-61 (1979), <span class="Italic">enforced as to other matters, </span>659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (proposal to ensure the accuracy of PDs did not affect management's right to assign work because the proposal did not prohibit the agency from changing the duties assigned to employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Right to select</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award requires the Agency to implement an accurate PD for already occupied positions.&#x2003;The award does not limit the Agency's ability to establish qualification requirements for the positions, nor does it limit the Agency's ability to determine whether the grievants possess the skills and abilities to perform the duties of their positions. As such, the award does not affect the Agency's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The late FPM Ch. 511, subch. 4 required that position descriptions accurately reflect duties. An arbitration award was not sustained that required the agency to accept an outdated position description. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 41 and DHHS, Office of Sec'y, Hq.</span>, 8 FLRA 98, 99 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">While the stipulated issue before an arbitrator may comprise only the accuracy of an employee's position description, if it is clear that the essential nature of the grievance concerns the classification of the position because the substance of the dispute is the grade level of duties assigned to and performed by the grievant, the grievance is not arbitrable under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). Although the arbitrator noted he could neither reclassify the grievant nor rule whether the position was correctly classified, the actual question addressed and resolved was so integrally related to and controlling of the grade of the position that it concerned position classification, <span class="Italic">FAA, Dept. of Transp., Tampa and Fed. Aviation Science and Tech. Ass'n, NAGE, Tampa</span>, 8 FLRA 532, 535 n.3 (1982):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority emphasizes that its decision herein is limited to the particular facts of this case.&#x2003;It in no manner prevents grievances concerning, and arbitral review of, the accuracy of an employee's official position description, including whether the duties regularly assigned by management and performed by the employee are accurately reflected by the position description, and it in no manner prevents an arbitrator, as appropriate, from ordering an agency to change the position description if the agency has decided to add unrelated duties to the position to be regularly performed by the employee. Because such an order does not directly concern position classification, it would be proper even if the change in the position description results in a classification appeal or reclassification of the position.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE Local 3917 and DHUD</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-126.html">72 FLRA 651</a> (2022) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (an opaque opinion seemed to suggest that an arbitrator properly held a grievance that included a request for an accurate PD was nonarbitrable because it was tied to a request for reclassification of the job or duties).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the arbitrator determines that the position description is inaccurate, he may direct that it be corrected, but he cannot correct, or order correction of, the classification, <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Local 3911</span>, 59 FLRA 520, 525 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the parties did not stipulate the issues in the underlying grievance, the Arbitrator framed the arbitrability issue, and resolved it, in terms of the accuracy of the grievant's position description. In the absence of a stipulation, the Authority will defer to the arbitrator's framing of the issues<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 933</span>, 58 FLRA 480, 482 (2003). Considered in terms of the issue as framed by the Arbitrator, the substance of the grievance in this case and the remedy requiring an accurate PD for the grievant would not be barred by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, despite framing the issue in terms of the accuracy of the PD, the Arbitrator did not confine his award solely to that issue. Rather, he also evaluated the FES prepared by the classification specialist and ordered a new FES consistent with his findings. A review of the Arbitrator's description of the FES involved in this case reveals that it constitutes the application by the specialist of OPM's classification criteria to the grievant's PD, the result of which is ultimately determinative of the classification. As such, the FES is a step in the process whereby a position is placed "in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM" and a matter pertaining to classification within the definition set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In examining the FES, the Arbitrator determined that the specialist improperly applied the classification criteria in finding that the grievant's position was correctly classified at the GS-12 level. The Arbitrator's analysis includes statements to the effect that an accurate PD would meet the criteria for the GS-13 position used by the specialist. As the award evaluates and modifies the FES, the Arbitrator's award concerns a classification matter and is deficient under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Muskogee, Okla.</span>, 47 FLRA 1112, 1116-17 (1993) (award found deficient under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) where arbitrator reviewed application of classification factors and determined they were improperly applied).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure.[18] The Authority interprets "classification" under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) in the context of 5 C.F.R. chapter 511, which defines classification of a position as"the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code."[19] Thus, the Authority has held that classification entails the identification of the appropriate title, series, grade, and pay system of a position,[20] and classification matters are implicated "when the essential nature of a grievance is integrally related to the accuracy of the classification of the grievant's position, e.g., where the substance of the dispute concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant."[21]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Authority has distinguished grievances regarding classification from those seeking impact-and-implementation bargaining over a change in classification.[22] In particular, the Authority has held that grievances concerning the duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of the reclassification of positions do not concern classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no contention that the Union either grieved or sought to bargain over the title, series, grade, or pay systems of affected employees. Rather, the grievance concerns only whether the Agency should have engaged in impact-and-implementation bargaining with the Union before implementing the joint PD and eliminating the lead-firefighter benefits. Thus, consistent with the principles set forth above, we find that the grievance did not involve classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent">An award that essentially conducted a classification (grade level) review rather than a review of the accuracy of a position description was set aside, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 64 FLRA 829, 830-31 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo. See NTEU, Chapter 24, </span>50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA, </span>43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala., </span>55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as involving the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification<span id="page_1678"></span> plan established by the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 51. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Atlanta, Ga., </span>62 FLRA 519, 521 (2008) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). Consequently, when the essential nature of a grievance is integrally related to the accuracy of the classification of a grievant's position, the grievance concerns a classification matter within the meaning of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA, Region 2, </span>61 FLRA 671, 675 (2006) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>). However, where the substance of a grievance is limited to the question of the accuracy of the grievant's position description, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Def., Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Ga., </span>57 FLRA 275, 277 (2001). By contrast, when a grievance requires an arbitrator to examine a position description for purposes of ascertaining whether a position is properly classified, the grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. EPA, Region 2, </span>59 FLRA 520, 525 (2003) (then-Member Pope dissenting in part as to other matters). Moreover, grievances concerning whether grievants are entitled to temporary promotions on the basis of having temporarily performed the established duties of a position other than their own are not barred by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See FAA, </span>62 FLRA at 521.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union did not file its grievance to obtain an accurate position description; rather, it filed the grievance to challenge the accuracy of the grievants' classification. The Union, in its step-one grievance, contended that the grievants were "entitled to a promotion to the GS-14 level" because they were performing higher-graded work. Similarly, in its step-two grievance, the Union asserted that a desk audit would prove that the grievants were performing higher-graded work. Further, at the hearing, the Union argued that the inaccurate position description, together with the grievants' new duties, established that the grievants were entitled to promotions to the GS-14 level, and that the classifier had failed to properly classify the grievants as GS-14 Economists. Indeed, based on the Union's arguments, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to perform a desk audit of the grievants' position so that it could determine the position's proper grade. Thus, based on these facts, it is clear that the substance of the Union's grievance concerned, and is integrally related to, the accuracy of the grievants' classification. <span class="Italic">See EPA, </span>61 FLRA at 675. The grievance, accordingly, is not grievable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although the grievants testified that they were performing the duties of an existing, previously classified position (GS-14 Economists), the record contains no basis for concluding that they sought only temporary promotions. As discussed above, their grievance alleged a violation of the classification provision of the parties' agreement and requested a desk audit and higher-graded pay as remedies.<span class="Italic"> </span>Therefore, although the Arbitrator awarded the grievants time-limited promotions, the Union's grievance is clearly analogous to grievances alleging the accretion of higher-graded duties to an existing position. The Authority has repeatedly held that such grievances "concern[&#8197;] a classification matter." <span class="Italic">EPA, </span>61 FLRA at 675 (citations omitted). Consequently, the Union's grievance remains non-grievable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's assertion that the Arbitrator merely ordered equal pay for equal work under Article 20, &#x00A7; 5 of the parties' agreement is similarly unavailing. The Authority has held that reliance on equal pay principles does not make grievable a grievance that concerns classification. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor, </span>63 FLRA 216, 218 (2009) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>) (Authority concluded that Union's reliance on equal pay principles did not make its grievance arbitrable because substance of grievance concerned classification). As discussed above, the record clearly establishes that the essential nature of the Union's grievance concerns, and is, therefore, integrally related to, the classification of the grievants' position. Article 20, &#x00A7; 5, accordingly, does not make the Union's grievance grievable. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the award resolved a classification dispute and set aside the award as inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FAA, </span>62 FLRA at 521 (setting aside award after concluding that it impermissibly resolved a classification dispute).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a grievant claims pay for a higher grade based on a claim that he was doing higher level duties, assuming the case involves no claimed reduction in grade or pay or temporary promotion, the employee's case involves a classification issue beyond the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 20 FLRA 694, 695 (1985). But the classification exception did not bar an award that directed management to provide the grievant a desk audit and return of duties that the arbitrator found to have been removed from her as reprisal for her request that the classification of her job be reviewed, action the arbitrator considered to be a prohibited personnel practice. The arbitrator did not direct a promotion or a change in the classification of the position. <span class="Italic">NASA, Lewis Research Ctr. and IFPTE Local 28</span>, 17 FLRA 966, 968 (1985).[Refer later in this chapter to "<span class="blue">Temporary Promotions</span>."]</p>
