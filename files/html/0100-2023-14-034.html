<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-35"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> Standards; Decision to Reflect Mitigating Factors or MSPB Imposes Maximum Reasonable Penalty</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden is on the agency to persuade the Board of the propriety of the penalty imposed, a burden that embraces proof by preponderant evidence of any facts supporting the sanction. <span class="Italic">Malinconico v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 542, 544 (1983). "Once the agency has presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of proper penalty, however, the burden of going forward with evidence of mitigating factors shifts to petitioner." <span class="Italic">Kissner v. OPM</span>, 792 F.2d 133 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The Board may review <span id="Page_2328"></span>the propriety of a penalty even if the appellant does not appear and testify at his own hearing. <span class="Italic">Pollard v. USPS</span>, 24 MSPR 472, 474 n.1 (1984). If the agency establishes the considerations leading to a choice of penalty, however, the Board is not free to substitute its judgment on penalty issues. Management is vested with "primary responsibility for maintenance of the productivity and discipline of the federal workforce." <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 6 MSPR 84, 88, 6 MSPB 82 (1981). The Board does not impose a more severe penalty than that imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Pumphrey v. BATF</span>, 14 MSPR 554, 559, 13 MSPB 191 (1983). The Board views its function as mitigating, when necessary, to the maximum reasonable penalty for the charges sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lavette v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 239, 247 &#x00B6; 19 (2004) ("The Board will independently weigh the relevant factors only if the deciding official failed to demonstrate that he considered any specific, relevant mitigating factors before deciding upon a penalty. If the penalty is unreasonable, the Board will mitigate it to the maximum reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">Payne v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 646, 651 (1996).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may prevent agencies from imposing extraordinary penalties. Should the agency impose a dual penalty for the same offense, e.g., a demotion and a suspension, the Board may need to examine the justifications offered for each component of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Hanna v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 233, 241 n.5 (1989). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-037.html#sec7-38">Exemplary Penalty</a>" and Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-208.html#sec1-206">Disciplinary Reassignment; Unified Penalties</a>; Reassignment Leading to Reduction in Pay."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an agency proves wrongdoing, the employing agency has the responsibility for determining the penalty--from nothing to removal. To earn deference to its penalty choice, the agency theoretically must pay its dues. Those dues consist of adherence to the commandments of <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/netsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=253434&version=253721">5 MSPR 280</a>, 305-06, 5 MSPB 313 (1981). <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, one of the Board's all-time top ten decisions, is explored here in detail. One of the Board's early, law-review style decisions, <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> was written with care and with the purpose of directing future penalty analysis by Board AJs and agencies. The decision, written like a law review article on consideration of discipline in government personnel cases, has served that purpose. It is often cited, seldom read. Practitioners would do well to take the time to find the decision, grab a beverage, sit back, and read it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, after a lengthy discussion concerning its authority to mitigate penalties, the Board determined that it inherited the authority vested by the Veterans Preference Act in the Civil Service Commission--the Board's functional predecessor--to reduce penalties in appropriate situations. The Board readily decided that it also had mitigation authority under 5 USC 1205(a)(1) [renumbered as 5 USC 1204(a)(1)], permitting it to take final action on matters within its jurisdiction, to modify or reduce agency-directed penalties. This authority is exercised in the first instance through the AJ's initial decision, subject to plenary Board review through a petition for review or reopening.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency has the initial burden to prove the facts that underlie the penalty. This is so whether the facts relate to the merits of the case, the aggravating circumstances in the individual case, past work record, nature of the employee's responsibilities, specific effects of the employee's conduct on the agency's mission or reputation, or consistency with other agency actions and with agency rules. All subordinate facts must be established by preponderant evidence. Nevertheless, the Board held, appropriateness of a penalty is not a factual determination. Deciding that the selection of a penalty is an exercise in judgment not susceptible to burdens of proof, the Board announced that agency action would be reviewed only to determine whether the choice of discipline is unreasonable. Under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 300-01:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Management of the federal work force and maintenance of discipline among its members is not the Board's function. Any margin of discretion available to the Board in reviewing penalties must be exercised with appropriate deference to the primary discretion which has been entrusted to agency management, not to the Board. Our role in this area, as in others, is principally to assure that managerial discretion has been legitimately invoked and properly exercised.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine reasonableness, the Board must be satisfied of the following: for the charges sustained, the agency penalty is within the range allowed by law, regulation, and any table of penalties; there has been consideration of all relevant factors; and there has been no clear error of judgment, a phrase describing the definite and firm administrative conviction that a mistake has been committed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 305-06. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> emphasized the need for agencies to consult with OPM guidelines concerning discipline contained in the Federal Personnel Manual [now abolished], particularly the admonition in FPM Chapter 751-1-2b, 1-2(c)(2), 5 MSPR at 303-04:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any disciplinary action demands the exercise of responsible judgment so that an employee will not be penalized out of proportion to the character of the offense; this is particularly true of an employee who has a previous record of completely satisfactory service. An adverse action, such as a suspension, should be ordered only after a responsible determination that a less severe penalty, such as admonition or reprimand, is inadequate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Having determined that deference will be paid to agency penalty decisions, the Board noted that agencies should specifically state in their decisions what factors led to the determination of the propriety of a particular penalty, 5 MSPR at 304:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7513(b)(4) of Title 5 requires that written agency decisions taking adverse actions must include "the specific reasons therefor." While neither this provision nor OPM's implementing regulation, 5 CFR 752.404(f), requires the decision notice to contain information demonstrating that the agency has considered all mitigating factors and reached a responsible judgment that a lesser penalty is inadequate, a decision notice which does demonstrate such reasoned consideration may be entitled to greater deference from the Board as well as from the courts. Moreover, aggravating factors on which the agency intends to rely for imposition of an enhanced penalty, such as a prior disciplinary record, should be included in the advance notice of charges so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those alleged factors before the agency's deciding official, and the decision notice should explain what weight was given to those factors in reaching the agency's final decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency does not demonstrate consideration of mitigating factors in its decision or through testimony of its deciding official, the Board independently assesses the proper penalty, as in a decision sustaining removal for failure to maintain a regular work schedule, <span class="Italic">Scott v. DHHS,</span> DC-0752-10-0198-I-1 (NP 9/8/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's determination of an appropriate penalty is not entitled to deference when the deciding official does not consider any of the relevant mitigating circumstances. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 425, 432 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 458, 461 (1981)). While the notice of proposed action discussed the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the notice of decision did not contain any discussion of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and the deciding official in this case did not testify at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). Therefore, we cannot hold by preponderant evidence that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors were considered by the deciding official when determining the penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Williams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CH-0752-13-0396-I-1 (NP 8/28/2014) ("Thus, we agree that the deciding official's treatment of the mitigating factors in his decision letter and testimony was not sufficiently substantive, and that it is appropriate not to defer to his penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See Stuhlmacher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 272, &#x00B6; 24 (2001) (it was not appropriate to defer to the deciding official's penalty determination where he failed to adequately consider relevant mitigating factors).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Douglas</span> enumerated the factors that may be relevant to a determination of discipline in a particular case--the oft-cited <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, 5 MSPR at 305-06:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Court decisions and OPM and Civil Service Commission issuances have recognized a number of factors that are relevant for consideration in determining the appropriateness of a penalty. Without purporting to be exhaustive, those generally recognized as relevant include the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;the employee's job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;the employee's past disciplinary record;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;the employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.&#x2003;the effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors' confidence in the employee's ability to perform assigned duties;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.&#x2003;consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">7.&#x2003;consistency of the penalty with the applicable agency table of penalties; [The Board mused in footnotes that these tables are not to be applied mechanically so that other factors are ignored. A penalty may be excessive in a particular case even if within the range permitted by statute or regulation. A penalty grossly exceeding that provided by an agency's standard table of penalties may for that reason alone be arbitrary and capricious, even though a table provides only suggested guidelines]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">8.&#x2003;the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">9.&#x2003;the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">10.&#x2003;potential for employee's rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">11.&#x2003;mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">12.&#x2003;the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2329"></span>The Board does not rank <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, but <span class="Italic">Luciano v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 335, 343 &#x00B6; 23 (2001), stated that "the most significant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor is the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or was frequently repeated." <span class="Italic">See Murry v. GSA</span>, 93 MSPR 554, 557-58 &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (repeating the <span class="Italic">Luciano</span> principle, citing <span class="Italic">Wynne v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 127, 135-36 (1997), and applying the principle to sustain removal for disrespectful behavior with prior discipline for similar behavior). Although the language from <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> is not often repeated in Board cases, <span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 414 &#x00B6; 38 (1999), noted that "[t]he Board will give deference to an agency decision that...reaches a responsible judgment that a lesser penalty is inadequate." <span class="Italic">See Rooffener v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 1, 3 (1982) (restating the essence of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> relative to Board review authority).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board dropped a footnote in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> stating that some factors may pertain to other issues in addition to penalty selection, e.g., the relation of the appellant's conduct to nexus or affirmative defenses. 5 MSPR at 306 n.67. The <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors may either be mitigating or aggravating. <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145</span>, 63 FLRA 181 n.1 (2009). The factors cannot be mechanically applied by a preordained formula. <span class="Italic">See Farrell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 314 F.3d 584, 594 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Although the same facts may pertain to both issues, care should be taken to distinguish issues concerning whether <span class="Italic">any</span> sanction may be imposed from those concerning whether a <span class="Italic">particular</span> penalty may be sustained, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 317, 321 (1981) (citing <span class="Italic">Douglas)</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One last area of confusion, more semantical than substantive, is the burden of proof applicable to the reasonableness of the penalty. The agency must prove "the facts on which [the] decision rests by the requisite standard of proof." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 334, 5 MSPR 308; 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1). However, once the facts, including aggravating and mitigating factors, have been established, "[t]he appropriateness of a penalty is a matter of judgment and discretion...." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 334, n.72, 5 MSPR 308, n.72. The question then becomes whether the exercise of agency judgment was within the bounds of reasonableness considering all relevant factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Douglas</span> cautioned that not all the dozen or so mitigation factors will apply to each case. 5 MSPR at 306. Selection of the penalty requires a responsible balancing of relevant factors. The Board's role is not to strike that balance but to assure that the agency conscientiously considered the relevant factors and struck the balance within tolerable limits of reasonableness. If the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors, or if the agency's judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness, the Board will specify how the agency decision should be corrected to bring the penalty into limits of reasonableness. The burden always remains on the agency to persuade the Board of the appropriateness of the penalty, 5 MSPR at 308:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In many cases the penalty, as distinct from the underlying conduct alleged by the agency, will go unchallenged and need not require more than <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> justification. An agency may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case supporting the appropriateness of its penalty by presenting to the Board evidence of facts on which selection of the penalty was based, a concise statement of its reasoning from those facts or information otherwise sufficient to show that its reasoning is not on its face inherently irrational, and by showing that the penalty conforms with applicable law and regulation. When no issue has been raised concerning the penalty, such a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case will normally suffice to meet also the agency's burden of persuasion on the appropriateness of the penalty. However, when the appellant challenges the severity of the penalty, or when the Board's presiding official perceives genuine issues of justice or equity casting doubt on the appropriateness of the penalty selected by the agency, the agency will be called upon to present such further evidence as it may choose to rebut the appellant's challenge or to satisfy the presiding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whenever the agency's action is based on multiple charges some of which are not sustained, the presiding official should consider carefully whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency. In all cases in which the appropriateness of the penalty has been placed in issue, the initial decision should contain a reasoned explanation of the presiding official's decision to sustain or modify the penalty, adequate to demonstrate that the Board itself has properly considered all relevant factors and has exercised its judgment responsibly.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> an agency need not show special consideration for younger employees: unless the employee's age is somehow connected to the offense, failure to consider age will not make an agency's selection of a particular penalty arbitrary or unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 312. Past discipline for failure to adhere to agency rules is good evidence that the employee is beyond rehabilitation, making removal particularly appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 313. If an agency argues that an employee's position involves trust and that the employee was aware of the regulations violated, it is the agency's responsibility, as part of a defense of a penalty, to offer proof of the employee's duties, the trust reposed in the employee, and his knowledge of regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gregory v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 16 MSPR 144, 146 (1983), summarized <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n agency must show that the penalty chosen was appropriate. Even in cases where the agency has proven by a preponderance of evidence the charge or charges contained in the notice of proposed adverse action and shown a nexus between the charges and the efficiency of the service, the Board will still make a separate determination whether the agency imposed penalty is clearly excessive, disproportionate to the sustained charges or arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. In order to make this determination, the Board must decide whether the agency has considered the relevant factors in making its determination of the penalty in a particular case and struck a responsible balance within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there are multiple specifications supporting a charge, the deciding official need not link <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to each specification. <span class="Italic">See McComber v. USPS</span>, DA-0752-13-0233-I-1 (NP 7/21/2014) ("To the extent that the appellant suggests that a deciding official must state which particular <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors relate to each specification supporting a charge, he has provided no support for his position and we are aware of none.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's formulation in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> was reviewed and approved in <span class="Italic">Weiss v. USPS</span>, 700 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir. 1983), involving dismissal of an employee for excessive absence. Rejecting the employee's argument that a penalty determination must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the court concluded that the Reform Act did not alter the preexisting law that determination of a penalty is to be reversed only if the punishment exceeded the range of sanctions permitted by the statute or was so harsh that it amounted to an abuse of discretion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dual objective [of the Reform Act] of "increas[ing] the procedural protections afforded employees, while also protecting the right of agencies to be able to maintain the most efficient workforce possible"...is well served by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard to the factual determination whether or not the employee committed acts warranting discipline, but leaving to the agency's discretion the judgment of what penalty should be imposed. In that manner, the MSPB, a neutral adjudicative body, determines whether the employee is guilty of the charged conduct, thus guarding against political abuse and safeguarding merit principles. Once the charges are sustained, however, efficient management is served by allowing the agency, within broad limits, to assess the severity of the penalty necessary, for instance, to deter extensive tardiness or absenteeism. To interpret 7701(c)(1)(B) as does plaintiff would be to go far in the direction of stripping the employing agency of the type of managerial authority Congress intended it to have, for under a preponderance standard, a standard ordinarily used for determining facts, the MSPB, rather than the employing agency, would be the primary decision maker....</p>
