<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-525"><span class="space">1.</span> Pricing, Use, and Location of Vending, Dining Facilities</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 8 FLRA 409, 412-13 (1982), determined it was appropriate to demand bargaining over what action the agency should take to avoid unreasonable increases in the price of cafeteria food sold by a third-party contractor--including posting a statement of percentage increases in prices. Although the agency could not direct the price of food, it could influence it through requests for action directed to GSA. To the extent the employer had that discretion, the exercise of discretion was negotiable. The proposal affected a working condition and was not precluded by law or regulation. FLRA distinguished <span class="Italic">NAATS and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 6 FLRA 588, 593 (1981) (Proposal IV), declining to order bargaining of a proposal that the agency influence legislative action to change working conditions: the relation between political efforts to influence legislative action and changes in personnel policies and working conditions was remote, speculative. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 8 FLRA 409, 411 (1982). There was no bar to the negotiability of a proposal requiring the agency to attempt through the exercise of its discretion and control over a permit for snack bar operations to maintain equity in prices and quality of services provided at the snack bar. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 51 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Mint, Assay Office, </span>9 FLRA 809, 811 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-134 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 589, 593-96 (1990) (negotiable: Proposals 1 and 2, demanding maintenance, during modification of cafeteria facilities, of quality of food services). An employer was required to bargain, to the extent of its discretion, if only by making requests or recommendations, with a food vending facility that effectively precluded use of its microwave ovens for employees who brought their own food, a change from the past when another firm allowed everyone to use the microwaves. As a remedy, FLRA restored the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> by directing that the agency restore through whatever means it might find suitable consistent with law employees' free access to a microwave unit. FLRA did not explain whether those means would consist of a request to the vendor or whether the agency was supposed to purchase a microwave. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress and CREA</span>, 15 FLRA 589, 592 (1984). An agency committed a ULP when it caused a vendor to downgrade equipment previously available to employees. There was no notice to the union and no opportunity for the union to negotiate concerning actions of the vendor and the agency. <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC, Veterans Canteen Serv., Lexington and NAGE Local R5-184</span>, 44 FLRA 179, 190 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">The effect on employees of an employer's plans concerning vending facilities need not be particularly great to trigger a bargaining obligation. In <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 35 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 54 FLRA 1377, 1381-82 (1998), the employer announced plans to construct a restaurant, available to employees but principally for the benefit of military personnel, and declined to bargain with the union over the location of the new facility. The location was a condition of employment and a bargainable issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concedes that the location of food services is a matter pertaining to the conditions of employment of unit employees.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-144 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>, 43 FLRA 1331, 1347-48 (1992). It follows that a proposal designating the location of a McDonald's restaurant that will be available to unit employees constitutes a matter pertaining to the conditions of employment of those employees. In particular, although NEXCOM contracted with McDonald's Corporation to establish a restaurant pursuant to its mission to provide services to military personnel, the Agency states that civilian personnel will be able to use the restaurant and does not dispute that unit employees would be among those civilian personnel. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Service Employees International Union, Local 556 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Marine Corps Air Station, Kaneohe Bay Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Activity, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii</span>, 49 FLRA 1205, 1209 (1994) (access to military exchange a condition of employment because of agency practice allowing civilian employees to use the exchange).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument concerning the use of COOP revenues for nonwork-related purposes is beside the point. As worded, the proposal concerns the location of a food service facility which is available to unit employees. That fact is determinative of whether the proposal pertains to the conditions of employment of those employees. The collateral effect of the location of the restaurant on COOP revenues and the uses of those revenues does not remove the proposal from the scope of bargainable conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of State, County &#x0026; Municipal Employees, Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 53 FLRA 1334, 1338 (1998) (proposal pertaining to unit employees' conditions of employment not rendered outside duty to bargain by indirect effect on matters outside scope of conditions of employment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The effect of the proposal on nonunit personnel, such as military personnel, supervisors and management officials, or employees in other bargaining units, also does not remove the proposal from the scope of bargainable conditions of employment and does not implicate the vitally affects test. The proposal concerns the conditions of employment of unit employees. By locating the McDonald's restaurant at the Scott Center Annex, the proposal might affect how accessible the restaurant is to personnel outside the unit--more accessible to some, less accessible to others. However this indirect effect on the availability of its services to personnel outside the unit does not mean that the proposal is outside the scope of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, North Carolina v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1440 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (extra-unit effects on nonunit personnel of proposal concerning unit employees' conditions of employment do not alter agency's duty to bargain over mandatory subjects). In this regard, where the question involves the indirect effects of a proposal concerning unit employees' conditions of employment on nonunit personnel, the vitally affects test is not implicated. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1440. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1920 and U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Fort Hood Exchange, Fort Hood, Texas</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 345-46 (1993). As such, we do not need to make that determination in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal requiring the agency to take action, including subsidization of prices to ensure that prices in the cafeteria not rise faster than employees' income, was negotiable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 29 FLRA 380, 385 (1987). An employer committed a ULP by unilaterally increasing the price of soft drinks at Base vending machines without notifying the union and allowing the union the opportunity to negotiate over the substance and impact of the change. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 46 FLRA 782, 783 (1992). FLRA noted that the Comptroller General determined that appropriated funds may be used to assist employee cafeterias even absent specific congressional authority upon the demonstration of factors that included the essential nature of the cafeteria operations and the difficulty in obtaining continued or alternate services. Agencies had discretion to provide subsidies within the limits of the Comptroller's decisions. Agencies were free to negotiate within the limit of that discretion. FLRA rejected arguments that the proposal interfered with the agency's right to determine its budget or that the proposal was nonnegotiable because nonunit employees might reap some benefit from it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another cafeteria case, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 43 FLRA 1331, 1340-52 (1992), found negotiable proposals that: dining accommodations provide seating capacity for 30% of the facility population; a private dining room be provided for unit members; drive-through services be available; facilities provide service of breakfast, lunch, supper, and snacks at designated hours; entr&#x00E9;es be available as a complete meal and a la carte; if leftovers are sold that they be priced at 50% of the original cost; that no frozen, canned, or dried products be used if fresh products are locally available, and that signs notify patrons when fresh products are not used; customers be provided chilled bottled water; microwave ovens be in place for patrons' use; furnishings and facilities be new and unused and no older than five years from manufacture; no disposable utensils or plates be used except for take out service; and that the cafeteria be located at a designated building site. Nonnegotiable for lack of connection to employment conditions were proposals that: an American flag be displayed; 10% of the gross income of the cafeteria be remitted to a Welfare and Recreation fund and that the monies collected be retained no more than 45 days; furnishings provided by the contractor become the property of the Welfare and Recreation board at the end of 10 years or when the facility is closed, the earlier; second-day leftovers be provided to the needy without charge. Nonnegotiable because it did not vitally affect conditions of employment was a proposal that separate dining tables be designated for contractor personnel. [<span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr.</span> is discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-018.html#sec5-19">'Vitally Affects' Text; <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span></a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">A union could require negotiations over discounted use of agency restaurant (mess) facilities at a remote location. Access by employees to commercial facilities was hampered by distance and time-consuming security processing involved in entering and exiting the activity site. The proposal concerned the working conditions of employees assigned to duties at the site. The charges for the food were not set by agency regulation. Regulations permitted the activity substantial discretion in its charges for food. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1153 and Army, Seventh Signal Command and Ft. Ritchie</span>, 26 FLRA 505, 509 (1987). That decision was extended by <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1622 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Meade</span>, 27 FLRA 11, 14 (1987), to require an agency to make its military mess facilities available to civilians without a surcharge. The agency had established a practice of permitting civilian use of the mess, making food services and prices charged conditions of employment. The union was not required to demonstrate a hardship if employees were denied access to a military mess facility that was the only dining facility within a reasonable distance. Too remotely connected with employment conditions to support bargaining were proposals designed to ensure that management secured the financial stability of a contractor-operated<span id="page_1012"></span> canteen facility. The financial problems of the NAF facility did not (then) cause a reduction in services. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 11 and Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo</span>, 44 FLRA 302, 309 (1992). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-510.html#sec6-511">Recreational, Exchange, and School Facilities</a>," for proposals concerning availability of post exchange facilities.]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declared negotiable several proposals that specified the conditions of membership for unit employees at agency military club facilities and that set prices paid by unit employees at the same price as that paid by other Luke Air Force Base personnel, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 64 FLRA 635, 636-39 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties dispute whether Proposal 1 concerns a condition of employment.&#x2003;Section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute defines "conditions of employment," with exclusions not relevant here, as "personnel polices, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions[.]" The Authority has held that bargaining proposals related to food prices and food services concern conditions of employment and are, therefore, within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IFPTE, Local 35,</span> 54 FLRA 1377, 1381 (1998) (Member Wasserman concurring) (finding proposal designating the location of a McDonald's restaurant to be negotiable); <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Edu. Ass'n,</span> 46 FLRA 625, 629-30 (1992) (finding, despite Agency's contentions that other options were sufficient, a direct connection between employees' exchange privileges and their work situations, in part because proposal "would enable employees to purchase a wider variety of food items for consumption during the duty day"); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Veterans Canteen Serv., Lexington, Ky.,</span> 44 FLRA 179, 189 (1992) (finding direct connection between unit employees' work situation and availability of particular break-room vending machines, in part because Agency's other snack machines did not provide cups with ice and did not include a sandwich maker); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-144,</span> 43 FLRA 1331, 1332, 1345-46 (1992) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>) (finding proposals regarding cafeteria's seating capacity; hours of operation; inventory of snack foods; pricing of leftovers; use of fresh produce; posting of signs concerning any "frozen, canned, or dried products[;]" provision of "'chilled' water equivalent to Crystal Spring in quality and taste[;]" number of microwaves; prohibition on disposable utensils and plates; and location all to be negotiable); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2614,</span> 43 FLRA 830, 833-34 (1991) (finding proposal to expand post exchange privileges to be negotiable, in part because unit employees had a "half hour limitation" on lunch periods); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury,</span> <span class="Italic">IRS</span> (Wash., D.C.), 27 FLRA 322, 325 (1987) (finding conditions of employment to include the price of break-room snack foods and the availability of a refrigerator). Applying this ample precedent, we find that Proposal 1 concerns a condition of employment and is therefore within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 would allow bargaining unit employees to: (1) join either club, regardless of their pay grade; and (2) obtain club membership for nine dollars. The first part of the proposal, allowing all bargaining unit employees to access both club dining facilities, concerns a condition of employment because it involves the provision of food services. <span class="Italic">See NAGE,</span> 43 FLRA at 1345 (proposals related to provision of food services are generally within duty to bargain). The second part of the proposal would allow all bargaining unit employees to become club members for one fixed price. As stated above, club membership affects the price employees pay for meals at the dining facilities; club membership, therefore, concerns the pricing of food available to bargaining unit employees. As a result, consistent with Authority precedent, the second part of the proposal concerns a condition of employment.[6] <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1347 (proposals regarding the pricing of food are generally within the duty to bargain). Because both parts of Proposal 1 concern conditions of employment, the proposal as a whole is within the duty to bargain, and the Agency's arguments as to why Proposal 1 does not concern a condition of employment are unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Although the dissent notes that a discount on food prices is merely one benefit of club membership, the Authority has never held that a proposal affecting food prices is rendered nonnegotiable because the proposal would confer other benefits on unit members as well. In this regard, the dissent does not deny that club members pay lower prices for food at the clubs. Therefore, club membership directly affects food prices. <span class="Italic">IFTPE, Local 11,</span> 44 FLRA 302 (1992) (IFTPE), cited by the dissent, is distinguishable because it concerned proposals that the Authority found did "<span class="Italic">not address</span> the provision of food services" at all. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 44 FLRA at 309 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Int'l Ass'n of Fire fighters, AFL-CIO, CLC, Local F-116,</span> 7 FLRA 123, 125 (1981), for the proposition that an activity concerns a condition of employment when it directly relates to unit employees' work situation or employment relationship. The Agency then contends that Proposal 1 does not directly relate to unit employees' employment relationship, and, therefore, the Agency asserts that the proposal does not concern a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's analysis is incomplete. An activity may concern a condition of employment not only when it directly relates to the employment relationship, but also when it directly relates to the work situation of unit employees. Proposal 1 concerns the prices and provision of food services, and because such matters directly relate to the <span class="Italic">work situation </span>of unit employees, the Authority has repeatedly held that proposals "pertaining to the availability and provision of food services for bargaining unit employees <span class="Italic">are within the mandatory scope of bargaining</span>." <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> 43 FLRA at 1345-46 (emphasis added). Stated differently, if an issue relates to the "availability and provision of food services[,]" then an agency is required to bargain over that issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, because the Agency does not address whether the proposal directly relates to the unit employees' work situation, the Agency's contention that the proposal does not directly relate to the unit employees' employment relationship is plainly insufficient to establish that Proposal 1 is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, negotiability precedent concerning dining conditions and pricing belies the Agency's contention that, because bargaining unit employees have alternatives for obtaining food, proposals involving dining options do not concern conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 866 F.2d 1443, 1445 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (access to post exchange facility concerned conditions of employment even though other options were available).[7] Thus, the availability of other dining options is not determinative of this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Like the Agency, the dissent relies on the fact that employees have other options for obtaining food besides the clubs. Dissent at fn.1. However, the Authority has repeatedly, and squarely, rejected similar arguments. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SEIU, Local 556,</span> 49 FLRA 1205, 1206 (1994) (rejecting agency contention that proposal was nonnegotiable because "adequate shopping facilities [exist] 'within a reasonable commuting distance' from the [a]gency's facilit[ies]"); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1786,</span> 49 FLRA 534, 536 (1994) (rejecting argument that proposal was nonnegotiable because "there [were] adequate shopping facilities within close proximity of the Agency's facilit[ies]"); <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Edu. Ass'n,</span> 46 FLRA 625, 629-30 (1992) (rejecting agency claim that other on-base dining options were sufficient and finding proposal negotiable because it "would enable employees to purchase a wider variety of food items for consumption during the duty day"); <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local R1-144,</span> 43 FLRA 1331, 1335 (1992) (rejecting agency argument that because, "for years[,] employees ha[d] utilized other available food sources[,]" proposal should be found nonnegotiable); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2614,</span> 43 FLRA 830, 831 (1991) (rejecting agency contention that, because there were "private sector shopping alternatives...near the employees['] homes and [workplaces,]" proposal granting teachers access to post exchange should be found nonnegotiable). The dissent asserts that, in cases such as <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1896 and Antilles,</span> the Authority considered the availability of other options as one of many factors for determining negotiability. Although that assertion is accurate, it does not detract from the fact that the Authority repeatedly has rejected arguments that the availability of other options rendered proposals nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Agency's assertion that Proposal 1 is outside the duty to bargain because it concerns only a "working condition" is misplaced because the Statute creates no substantive distinction between "working conditions" and "conditions of employment" as those terms are practically applied. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 355th MSG/CC, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.,</span> 64 FLRA 85, 90 (2009). Therefore, even if Proposal 1 concerns only a "working condition," that would not be a sufficient justification for finding that the proposal is not within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 would allow all bargaining unit employees to: (1) eat at both base cafeterias; and (2) eat at the cafeterias without paying any "surcharges, assessments, or adjustments." As the first part of the proposal would afford all bargaining unit employees the right to eat at dining facilities at their place of employment, it concerns a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See NAGE,</span> 43 FLRA at 1345. Because the second part of the proposal concerns the price bargaining unit employees would pay for meals at dining facilities, for the reasons enumerated with respect to Proposals 1 and 2, it also concerns a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1347. The foregoing establishes that Proposal 3, as a whole, concerns conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that Proposal 3 is not within the duty to bargain because the Agency does not have a past practice of allowing civilian employees the right to eat at its cafeterias is unavailing. The Authority examines the existence of past practices in "close cases" when it is unclear whether a matter concerns a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12,</span> 60 FLRA 533, 534 (2004) (Member Armendariz concurring) (citation omitted). As stated above, if a matter involves the prices or provision of food services at the bargaining unit members' place of employment, then an agency generally must bargain over that matter. <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> 43 FLRA at 1345-46. This proposal is not exceptional in any way that would justify a deviation from that general proposition. Proposal 3 concerns the prices and provision of food services; the Agency, therefore, is required <span id="page_1013"></span>to bargain over the proposal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The proposal, accordingly, does not involve a "close case[ ]" that would require us to examine the Agency's past practices. As the Agency's remaining arguments are the same arguments that we rejected above, they also fail to provide a basis for finding Proposal 3 outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that Proposal 3 concerns conditions of employment, and it is, therefore, within the duty to bargain.</p>
