<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-122"><span class="space">11.</span> Related Proceeding</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">At the time an individual is dismissed, a number of related legal appeals may be initiated or in the works. There may be an unemployment compensation case, a criminal proceeding, an EEO case, other MSPB appeals, grievances, a lawsuit, or workers' compensation claims. Should an appellant prevail in his Board case, he may attempt to tack onto his fee claim time spent in one of these related (or unrelated) legal proceedings. Little litigation occurs concerning recovery for time spent in collateral proceedings. Recall the rule that for time to be compensable, the result achieved must be secured through a Board appeal. The implication is that compensable time should have some logical connection to the Board case. Logic is relative. The Board declined to award fees on the related case theory for time invested in a lawsuit against the Board to speed up the processing of the case at the headquarters level. <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 135-36 (1987). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Rothschild v. DHUD</span>, 54 MSPR 238, 243 (1992) (approving fees for time spent in court obtaining an order compelling the agency to make a decision on the proposed adverse action). Logic found expression in <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 467, 472 (1995): two conditions should be met to recover fees for optional work collateral to the appeal: the other proceeding should be factually related to the Board appeal and the work in the other proceeding should significantly contribute to the success of the Board appeal. Generosity has its limits. <span class="Italic">Manley</span> denied recovery for time spent with OSC when there was no showing that the time spent significantly contributed to success of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some decisions that follow discuss fee awards for work performed in related cases that produced information (or results) used to appellant's advantage in his successful Board appeal. Such time is compensable. In 1989 the Board decided <span class="Italic">McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 399, 407-10 (1989), providing some cohesion to the Board's rules governing awards of fees in related proceedings. The appellant pursued an agency EEO complaint through the investigation stage and the appellant also unsuccessfully pursued a complaint of prohibited personnel practices with OSC. Although <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> was a mixed case, its analysis appears to apply to all Board appeals. The Board applied a "useful and of a type ordinarily necessary" standard to the time invested in collateral proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Webb v. Board of Education of Dyer County</span>, 471 U.S. 234 (1985)...[t]he Court implied...that fees may be awarded for a "discrete portion" of work done in prior optional proceedings, outside the litigation in which the fees are requested, to the extent that it was "useful and of a type ordinarily necessary" to the successful outcome of that subsequent litigation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Webb</span> also noted that the statute under which the petitioner sought relief in the Supreme Court did not require him to exhaust the prior avenues of redress for which fees were requested. The courts of appeal and the district courts have split in their subsequent interpretation of the decision in <span class="Italic">Webb</span>, some construing it narrowly to allow fees only for work done in required prior proceedings, and some giving it a broader interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has adopted the broader interpretation of <span class="Italic">Webb</span>, holding in <span class="Italic">Nadolney v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 30 MSPR 561, 565 (1986), that fees may be awarded for time spent on a separate and optional, but factually related, proceeding if (1) the claimed portion of work done in that proceeding is reasonable under the standard set forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">Kling</span>...and (2) the work, or some "discrete portion" of it, done in the other proceeding, significantly contributed to the success of the subsequent Board proceeding and eliminated the need for work that otherwise would have been required in connection with that subsequent proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Nadolney</span>, we reaffirmed our earlier decision in <span class="Italic">King v. United States Postal Service</span>, 20 MSPR 467, 471 (1981), in which, applying similar criteria, we held that fees were not awardable for work done in a state unemployment compensation hearing that was not shown to be in any way connected with or necessary to the successful prosecution of the appellant's appeal before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant...filed an internal agency Equal Employment Opportunity...complaint....&#8197;The appellant's counsel...spent time obtaining a copy of the EEOC's internal investigation file in this matter, <span id="Page_4657"></span>and conducted their own factual investigation of the discrimination issue in preparing their appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the time spent by the appellant's counsel marshalling the facts in regard to the discrimination issues--which arose from a common core of facts that were the basis of the Board appeal--contributed to the success of that Board appeal and eliminated the need for such work that would otherwise have been necessary in connection with the Board appeal in any event. Further, inasmuch as neither the internal agency EEO grievance nor the EEOC complaint proceeded to the hearing stage, the work done on those matters was in fact utilized only in connection with the subsequent Board proceeding....&#8197;The time spent on these matters, therefore, was "useful and of a type ordinarily necessary" to the successful outcome of the subsequent Board proceeding, and is properly compensable under <span class="Italic">Webb</span> and <span class="Italic">Nadolney</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, with regard to the allegations of discrimination and whistleblower reprisal made before the Board's Special Counsel, the Board has held that fees may be awarded for work done before the Special Counsel in pursuit of a successful resolution of a matter before the Board. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Schweiker</span>, 14 MSPR 175, 177-8 (1982). As noted in that case...the request for fees therein was analogous to the Board's award for services rendered to an appellant prior to the issuance of the agency's final decision, but in connection with the appealable action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As with the work done on discrimination issues before the agency, then, the effort made by the appellant's counsel on the reprisal and discrimination claims before the OSC consisted of investigation of the facts, legal research, and preparation of the appellant's complaint to the OSC....&#8197;[T]hat effort was not duplicated after the Board appeal was begun, was ultimately put to use only in the appellant's Board appeal, and was an integral part of his affirmative defense allegations, despite the fact that the Board did not address those defenses in its decision. We thus find that under the standard of <span class="Italic">Webb</span> and <span class="Italic">Nadolney</span>, fees are awardable to the appellant for work done in furtherance of that issue both before the agency's final decision was rendered and in his complaint to the Special Counsel's Office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OSC time was also awarded in <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 446-47 (1991). Although the efforts before OSC were not successful in <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span>, they proved helpful and therefore compensable when later Board litigation led to a favorable settlement for the appellant. For another example of a case awarding fees for a related proceeding, refer to <span class="Italic">Goldbach v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 9, 16-18 (1991), compensating time spent in a state court proceeding that established the existence of a common law marriage that was, in turn, the predicate for an award of a survivor's annuity. An example of work deemed unrelated to the Board appeal was time spent by counsel recovering some money allegedly stolen within the agency from the appellant. The appellant did not show that recovery of the stolen money aided the Board in resolving his appeal or in assuring full compliance with its order reinstating the appellant. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 157, 161 (1989), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 476, 478-79 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 614, 619-21 (1994), considered fee claims for several different types of MSPB-related proceedings. The decision provides a general indication of what the Board will and will not allow:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the administrative judge erred by awarding fees for the following legal services and costs incurred by the appellant's counsel: A telephone conference with the appellant's bankruptcy attorney; the appellant's representation in an unemployment proceeding; conferences with the appellant's congressional representative; telephone conferences and interviews with the media; consultation and correspondence with the union; and alleged "[u]nexplained and [u]nallocated [a]dministrative expenses."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Time spent outside of Board proceedings is compensable in an attorney fee award where counsel has established that the time spent was connected with or necessary to the successful prosecution of the action under appeal. Here, the appellant's counsel explained the work performed outside of the Board proceedings as follows: It was necessary to consult with the bankruptcy attorney regarding issues raised in the Board appeal and to obtain relevant documents; counsel's representation of the appellant in the unemployment compensation proceeding was necessary because the issues involved were "inextricably intertwined" with the Board issues, and the agency sent an attorney from Washington, D.C. to represent it at the hearing with the intention of cross examining the appellant and using the transcript of the unemployment proceeding in the Board appeal; counsel discussed the appellant's case with a Federal Times reporter, who wrote an article about it because counsel believed that media exposure was critical to the success of the appellant's case; and conferences with the union president were critical to the investigation and preparation of the appeal because he assisted in setting up appointments with witnesses and in obtaining documents and information used in the discovery process, and counsel relied upon his expertise in developing issues more efficiently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly rejected the claimed fees for media-related time as not sufficiently related to the Board appeal. Also, we find that the appellant's counsel failed to show that time expended with the appellant's congressional representative was sufficiently related to the Board appeal. The appellant's counsel, however, has shown that the time expended on the remaining matters was sufficiently related to, and necessary for the successful prosecution of, the appellant's Board appeal. Therefore, the administrative judge properly allowed the time expended on these matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency further contends that the administrative judge erred by awarding "[u]nexplained and [u]nallocated [a]dministrative [e]xpenses," some of which it claims were unrelated to the Board proceedings, and that the administrative judge improperly "gave blanket approval for all of these costs," including costs for postage, parking, facsimiles, telephone calls, and in-office and telephonic client conferences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not support the agency's contention that the administrative judge "gave blanket approval for all of these costs." A review of the record indicates that some of these costs, including the cost of the call to the appendant's congressional representative, were included with legitimate costs and that, even taken together, the total costs and amount of time expended were <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. We find that to remand on this issue alone would be frivolous and is not required. Moreover, the administrative judge, in scrutinizing the time claimed by the appellant's counsel, considered the agency's argument that not all of the time claimed was compensable, separated the compensable time from the noncompensable time, and allowed only the time he found was related to the Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sowa v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 408, 414-15 &#x00B6; 12 (2004), considered and denied fees for collateral litigation that had no substantive value in the Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note...that the appellant's claim that much of the work spent in other fora should be recoverable, because that work was directly related to the Board appeal, is without merit. The appellant argues that the testimony concerning her duties and performance, which was elicited from the witnesses in the grievance and EEO proceedings, was directly related to the issues of whether the agency should have selected her for termination in the "staff adjustment" in accordance with the agency's procedures and whether the agency discriminated and retaliated against her. As explained below, however, these issues were irrelevant to the appellant's victory before the Board. The appellant prevailed because the administrative judge determined that the agency separated her by conducting a RIF without invoking the required RIF procedures and that the agency expressly abandoned prior to the hearing any attempt to show that the appellant still would have been separated had it conducted the "staff adjustment" in accordance with the RIF procedures. This determination was unrelated to the work spent on failed discrimination claims in other fora that pertained to whether the agency properly selected her, as opposed to other employees, for termination. Thus, work done contesting the merits of the agency's selection of the appellant for termination during the "staff adjustment" was unrelated to the facts and issues upon which she ultimately prevailed before the Board.</p>
