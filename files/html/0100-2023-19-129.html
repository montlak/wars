<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-125"><span class="space">a.</span> Current Substance Abuser</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Little v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 574, 577-84 (1995), followed EEOC decisions to determine that employees whose removals are proposed for current drug use are not protected by the Rehabilitation Act (or ADA). Individuals disciplined for drug use or related misconduct may not invoke the Rehabilitation Act's protections by showing after-the-fact rehabilitation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a Distribution Clerk with the Winston-Salem, North Carolina Post Office. On January 21, 1994, he was removed from his position on charges of failing to be regular in attendance and absence without leave (AWOL); the agency also considered his past disciplinary record, including a 92-day suspension, for similar misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the appellant challenged the charges and also contended, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency had wrongfully removed him because of his "drug problem," and it thus had discriminated against him on the basis of a disabling condition under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 791). The appellant contended that although the agency knew of his drug addiction, and attempts at rehabilitation, it failed to reasonably accommodate him by offering him an opportunity for further rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained the charges and found the removal penalty reasonable. He rejected the appellant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination on the basis of his drug use. The administrative judge found that the appellant had not shown that he was an addict as opposed to a mere drug user; nor had he established that his irregularity in attendance and/or absences were caused by his drug use. Accordingly, the administrative judge sustained the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant does not challenge the sustaining of the charges or the penalty. However, he argues that the evidence shows that he is addicted to drugs, that he should have been given a "last chance agreement," and that he should have been accommodated for his drug addiction by being given a "firm choice" between rehabilitation and removal. He further argues that he attended a drug rehabilitation program after being removed and thus that he is not a current drug user and is, therefore, entitled to the protection of sections 503 and 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act as amended in 1978 (codified at 29 USC 793, 794).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As detailed below, Title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, was again amended by provisions of Title V of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of July 26, 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 375, now codified at 42 USC 12101, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> and in various sections of title 29, USC, to exclude from its protection users of illegal drugs. We have not previously addressed these amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, and we do so here. We conclude that as a current user of illegal drugs, the appellant is not entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act, and we reject the appellant's claim of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is a prohibited personnel practice to discriminate against federal employees on the basis of a disabling condition under Title V, section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 390, codified as amended, at 29 USC 791. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(1). Sections 503 and 504, 29 USC 793, 794, do not apply to the federal sector. Section 793 applies to federal contractors; section 794 applies to federally funded programs or activities conducted by an executive agency. To the extent that the appellant attempts to gain the protections of sections 503 and 504, therefore, his reliance is misplaced. The U.S. Postal Service is covered under section 501, 29 USC 791(b).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Under the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, the complaint procedures provided under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16) were made available for federal employees asserting disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 794a(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1978, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to exclude "any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing the duties of the job in question or whose employment, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 706(7)(B) (1979). By its terms, the 1978 amendments did not apply to section 791 but only to sections 793 and 794. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Board held that alcohol or drug abuse, regardless of current use, constitutes a disabling condition requiring reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1978. <span class="Italic">See Ruzek v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPB 307, 7 MSPR 437, 441-444 (1981). Beginning in 1988, the Board substantially modified <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> and its progeny. In <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 224 (1988), the Board held that mere casual users were not protected. Under the law then in effect, to qualify for protection, an appellant must establish a disabling condition and must provide evidence from himself concerning his pattern of drug abuse and its ill effects, and from medical or diagnostic experts that that pattern along with his other symptoms constitutes the disabling condition of drug or alcohol abuse; an individual must show that he is an addict or an abuser as opposed to merely being a user who is not entitled to protection. <span class="Italic">See McCaffrey</span>, 36 MSPR at 229. Further, while upholding the principle that individuals who are alcoholics or drug abusers are disabled, the Board held that individuals so addicted were not protected from discipline for misconduct so severe as to disqualify such individual for a position or because such addiction creates conduct incompatible with the performance of job duties. <span class="Italic">See Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135, 142-44 (1988), <span class="Italic">modified by Banks v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 141 (1993), to allow such discipline only if a "firm choice" has been offered. Nonetheless, only if an employee first showed that his misconduct was caused by his disability or was entirely a manifestation of his addiction, must an agency offer him such a choice between removal and rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 124 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In adjudicating the appellant's disability claim under the above-referenced statutes and legal precedent, the administrative judge found that the appellant had not shown that he was an addict as opposed to a mere user. Nor had he shown that his attendance irregularities were caused by his alleged drug addiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth below, however, although the appellant argues in his petition for review that he is an addict and that his misconduct was caused by his drug addiction, and claims that he is entitled to a firm choice between rehabilitation and removal, he cites to no statute or legal precedent arising out of the ADA....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset we note that Title V of the ADA, the title at issue here, does not establish an effective date for its implementation. It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction, however, that a statute takes effect upon its enactment, unless the effective date is fixed by constitutional or statutory provision, or is otherwise provided in the statute itself. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2 Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction 33.06 (1991). The ADA, Pub. L. No. 101-336, was enacted July 26, 1990. Thus, we view Title V as taking effect on that date.[6] The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) also accepts July 26, 1990 as the effective date for Title V of the ADA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Avant v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940057, slip op. at 6-7 (June 23, 1994); <span class="Italic">Smalle v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03930174, slip op. at 5 (Mar. 31, 1994). The appellant's removal occurred subsequent to that date and thus the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act made by the ADA are applicable to this appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Other titles of the ADA provided for different effective dates. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, sec. 108 of Pub. L. No. 101-336, relating to Title I (Employment), "effective 24 months after the date of enactment," codified at 42 USC 12111 note. <span class="Italic">See also</span> sec. 205 of Pub. L. No. 101-336, relating to Title II (Transportation), "effective 18 months after the date of enactment," codified at 42 USC 12131 note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 512 of the ADA amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3547"></span>For purposes of subchapter V, the term 'individual with handicaps' does not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when a covered entity acts on the basis of such use.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 706(8)(C)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The amendments further provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to exclude as an individual with handicaps an individual who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(I)&#x2003;has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(II)&#x2003;is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(III)&#x2003;is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See id.</span>, sec. 706(8)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that section 512 could be read to contain an ambiguity in the coverage of section 512 of the ADA because it contains the phrase "covered entity." The term "covered entity" is defined under section 101 of the ADA to mean: "an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC 12111(2). However, the term "employer" does not include the United States. <span class="Italic">See</span> sec. 101 of the ADA, codified at 42 USC 12111(5)(B)(i). We now address this ambiguity, however, and we conclude that, notwithstanding the exclusion of the United States from the phrase "covered entity" in Title I of the ADA, such phrase is used differently in section 512 and there is no doubt that section 512 applies to federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, as enacted, section 512, which is entitled "Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act," stated that section 706(8) is amended by adding the language "For purposes of title V...." <span class="Italic">See</span> sec. 512(a). As codified in 29 USC 706(8)(C)(i), section 512 reads, "[F]or purposes of subchapter V of this chapter...." The reference to "title V" in section 512 is to the original Title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that included sections 501, 503 and 504. <span class="Italic">See</span> Title V, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 390. As codified, these sections all fall under "subchapter V" of Chapter 16, 29 United States Code.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;These changes to the 1973 Rehabilitation Act were consistent with the changes made to the definition of the term "individual with a disability" used elsewhere in the ADA. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 596, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 87-89 (1990); H.R. Rep. No. 485, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 77, 141-42 (1990), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1990, 267, 359-60, 424-25, 596-98. <span class="Italic">See also</span> sec. 104 of Title I of the ADA, codified at 42 USC 12114(a); sec. 510 of Title V of the ADA, containing miscellaneous provisions, codified at 42 USC 12210(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly then, section 512 applies by its terms to sections 501, 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and excludes illegal drug users in the entities covered under those provisions from protection. The term "covered entity" is thus not used in section 512 as such term was defined in Title I of the ADA; rather it is used in section 512 as a general term referring to the entities covered under section 512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation is preferable for a number of reasons. First, it is significant to note that, in defining "covered entity," section 101 of the ADA limits its applicability to Title I of the ADA ("As used in this subchapter..."). 42 USC 12111. The term is not separately defined in or for purposes of Title V of the ADA. Further, a statute should be construed to produce the greatest harmony with the least inconsistency. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Otherson</span>, 637 F.2d 1276, 1282 (9th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 454 U.S. 840, 102 S. Ct. 149, 70 L. Ed.2d 123 (1981). So interpreting the term "covered entity" in section 512 accomplishes the purpose of excluding users of illegal drugs from coverage under the Rehabilitation Act and renders this provision consistent with the ADA as it applies to the private sector. Moreover, it is generally held that a statute should not be interpreted so as to render one part superfluous. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 673-74 (Fed. Cir. 1987). If the definition of "covered entity" pertains only to the entities described in Title I of the ADA, the reference to "title V" in section 512 would be superfluous because, as noted above, "title V" pertains to Title V of the Rehabilitation Act and the amendments made by section 512 of the ADA apply to federal employees covered under section 791 and to those entities covered under sections 793 and 794 of the Rehabilitation Act. Finally, we note that we are in accord with the EEOC in so interpreting section 512 of the ADA. <span class="Italic">See Frias v. USPS</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940061, slip op. at 3 (July 21, 1994); <span class="Italic">Avant</span>, slip op. at 6-7; Smalle, slip op. at 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> generally <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 481 (Spec. Pan. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, the appellant testified that he was under the influence of drugs when he was absent from work on December 6, 1993. Further, he asserted that he entered rehabilitation only after his removal. Thus, the appellant is an admitted current drug user. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 706(8), excluding one who is "currently" using illegal drugs "when a covered entity acts on the basis of such use."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not specify what drugs he was addicted to. Section 512(b) of the ADA amended the Rehabilitation Act to define "drug" to mean "a controlled substance, as defined in schedules I-V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 USC 812)." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 706(4)(A). Section 512(b) defined the "illegal use of drugs" to mean the use of drugs, "the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act." This does not include the use of drugs "taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act, or other provisions of Federal law." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 706(4)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must establish his affirmative defense of disability discrimination by preponderant evidence. The appellant testified that in the summer of 1993 he attended a drug rehabilitation program and then enrolled in Narcotics Anonymous. He has not asserted that his addiction was to prescription drugs or in any way indicated that it was not to a controlled substance. In view of his participation in two rehabilitation programs and his enrollment in Narcotics Anonymous, we find that he has not met his burden of proving by preponderant evidence that he was addicted to drugs that are not disqualifying under the ADA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, under 29 USC 706(8)(C)(ii), an individual with disabilities is not excluded from Rehabilitation Act protection under certain circumstances: successful completion of a supervised drug rehabilitation program where such individual is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs; or such individual has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully; and such individual is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or such individual is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use. Nothing in the record shows that the appellant met any of these criteria prior to the date his removal was proposed or effected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the appellant is not entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, although as noted, the appellant testified at the hearing that subsequent to his removal he entered a rehabilitation program and is now rehabilitated, we concur with the EEOC that policy concerns dictate that individuals who are disciplined for drug use or misconduct related to drug use, may not be permitted to invoke the Rehabilitation Act's protections simply by showing "after-the-fact" that they are rehabilitated. <span class="Italic">See Berry v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, EEOC Petition No. 01933726 (Aug. 25, 1994); <span class="Italic">Frias</span>, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">Smalle</span>, slip op. at 6; <span class="Italic">Thomas v. VA</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03920076, slip op. at 4 (Apr. 22, 1993). We defer to EEOC's substantive determination in this regard<span class="Italic">. See generally Ignacio</span>, 30 MSPR at 481. As noted by the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, such "after-the-fact" enrollment would defeat the plain purpose of the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act. As EEOC points out, the legislative history specifically states that section 512 was intended to assure employers that they may discharge or deny employment to persons who are currently engaged in the illegal use of drugs without fear of being held liable for discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Thomas</span>, slip op. at 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note in this regard, that the date used by EEOC to determine whether an individual is a "current" drug abuser under 29 USC 706(8)(C)(i), is the date a notice of proposed adverse action is issued rather than the date that action is effected. While <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> involved an individual who sought rehabilitation only after removal, which the EEOC called an "after-the-fact" showing of rehabilitation, and <span class="Italic">Berry</span> involved an individual who did not seek rehabilitation at all, the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Smalle</span> and <span class="Italic">Frias</span> also considered rehabilitation attempts that came earlier but still after the proposal notice. In <span class="Italic">Smalle</span>, the appellant was issued a notice of proposed removal on October 2, 1992, and sought rehabilitation on October 13, 1992. The EEOC specifically held (citing to <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>) that seeking rehabilitation "after the charges were made" constituted an "after-the-fact" showing of rehabilitation and did not entitle the appellant to the protection of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Smalle</span>, slip op. at 4-5. <span class="Italic">See also Frias</span>, slip op. at 3 (rehabilitation sought after the charges were preferred was "after-the-fact" and did not entitle the appellant to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act, again relying upon <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;At least one circuit court of appeals has held that in an action arising under section 706, the determination of whether one is a "current" drug abuser is to be made as of the date of the termination. <span class="Italic">Teahan v. Metro-North Commuter R. Co.</span>, 951 F.2d 511, 517-20 (2d Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 113 S. Ct. 54, 121 L. Ed.2d 24 (1992). Because the appellant here did not even enter rehabilitation until after his removal, we need not specifically address any conflict of authority in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant is not entitled to claim disability discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and, therefore, his affirmative defense must fail. The removal is sustained.</p>
