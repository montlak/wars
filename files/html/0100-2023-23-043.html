<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-44"><span class="space">e.</span> Mental Incapacity; Stress</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant attempts to set aside a settlement for lack of mental capacity, the Board may remand the case to the AJ for analysis if the appellant's allegations are not conclusory, <span class="Italic">Simpson v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 253, 258-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant alleges emotional distress as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board will consider: whether the appellant was represented below; whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time of settlement; and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his representative in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Short v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 214, 219 (1995). If the appellant's assertions are more than merely conclusory, the Board will remand the appeal to determine whether the settlement agreement is valid. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Franklin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 MSPR 294 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 10 (1999) (the Board remanded the appeal to determine the validity of the settlement agreement after the appellant presented detailed allegations that her representative did not enter into the agreement with her consent).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Throughout his appeal, the appellant has acted in a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> capacity. He asserted that, at the time he signed the October 31, 1997 settlement agreement, he was under the influence of several prescription medications; he remembered agreeing to only the part of the settlement agreement canceling his removal; he verbally informed the agency and the administrative judge that he expected to return to work in the future, and he "must have been temporarily out of [his] reasonable mind with anger, anxiety, emotional distress, mental stress, physical pain caused by an injury on the job and related job stress" because he did not realize that the remaining parts of the settlement agreement existed. He further asserted that he used his Postal Service identification to enter agency premises up until July 23, 1998, and no one told him that he had been removed. As detailed above, the appellant also presented Schwartz's March 23, 1999 letter, which stated that the appellant had been "totally disabled from a psychiatric standpoint throughout the entire period of [his] treatment," that is, January 30, 1997, through the date of the letter. That period includes the date the settlement agreement was signed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that these constitute more than conclusory assertions that the appellant involuntarily entered into the settlement agreement. Thus, under all the circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand the appeal for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a claim that appellant's emotional distress warranted setting aside a settlement, <span class="Italic">Harman v. DOD</span>, 76 MSPR 438, 441 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]here an appellant alleges emotional distress as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board will consider: whether the appellant was represented below; whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time of settlement; and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his representative in the appeal<span class="Italic">. See Short v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 214, 219 (1995). The party challenging the validity of an agreement, however, bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidating it. <span class="Italic">See Bowie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 42, 44 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant's conclusory allegations of duress and mutual mistake regarding the Board's jurisdiction over his EEO complaints does not provide a basis for invalidating the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Virgil v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 MSPR 109, 113 (1997); <span class="Italic">Lasker v. Department of Justice</span>, 74 MSPR 189, 191 (1997). Similarly, the appellant's bare allegation of stress and confusion is insufficient to set aside the settlement. The appellant was represented by counsel below, counsel participated in the settlement negotiations and signed the agreement along with the appellant, and the appellant has not demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time of the settlement or otherwise shown that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board offered analysis of mental confusion, and a summary of its law, in <span class="Italic">Wallace v. VA</span>, 50 MSPR 676, 678-79 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant has alleged emotional distress as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board considers: whether the appellant was represented below; whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time of the settlement agreement; and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the agreement or to assist his representative in regard to the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moran v. Veterans Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 547, 552, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 923 F.2d 869 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was represented below, and his representative participated in the settlement.... It is significant that neither the appellant nor his representative ever indicated that the appellant was mentally incapable of entering into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moran</span>, 43 MSPR at 552-53; <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 41 MSPR 666, 670 (1989); <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 674, 676 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The medical documents submitted by the appellant on petition for review do not show that he was mentally impaired at the time of the settlement agreement. He submits a July 5, 1991 letter from his physician stating that the appellant's first 6 months of 1991 were characterized by "rapid cycling hypomania and depression," and that his mood was "stable" on May 1 and 21, 1991, but he was "again depressed" on June 12, 1991. The physician further states that the appellant's condition is "not severe enough to render him legally incompetent, but can affect his judgement," rendering him subject to impulsive decisions. The appellant also submits a written statement by a psychiatrist that, given the degree of stress the appellant experienced because of his removal, "it is possible that he may not have been able to make an informed decision regarding his separation benefits" from the agency when he signed the settlement agreement on May 30, 1991. Because these medical documents merely speculate about the appellant's mental condition on May 30, 1991, when the parties entered into the settlement agreement, they do not show that he was mentally impaired at the time.... Nor do the documents establish that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his representative in regard to his appeal.... We note the appellant's assertion on petition for review that he is presently taking medication to control his emotional condition, but he does not allege that he was under the influence of such medication when he signed the settlement agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant argues that his anxiety over his financial status caused him to sign the settlement agreement, which was not his true intention. As evidence, he includes a gas and electric bill stating that, unless the appellant paid the bill by May 29, 1991, his utilities would be disconnected. However, his assertion that he signed the settlement agreement because of his financial condition does not render the agreement invalid. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hightower v. Department of Transportation</span>, 39 MSPR 538, 541 (1989). Based upon the above findings, we conclude that the appellant has failed to bear his burden of proving that the settlement agreement is invalid. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616, 621 (1990).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant maintains that she was under duress on December 29, 1992, because of the physical and emotional effects of what was then a three-month pregnancy. The test for duress is an objective one; it is not measured by the employee's subjective evaluation of the situation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Womack v. US Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 348, 351 (1991). Where an appellant has alleged emotional distress as a ground for involuntariness, the Board considers whether the appellant was represented below, whether she has demonstrated that she was mentally impaired at the time, and whether she has otherwise shown that she was unable to understand fully the nature of the action in question or to assist her representative in regard to the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Veterans Administration</span>, 50 MSPR 676, 678 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was represented by counsel during the settlement negotiations and preparation of the withdrawal letter. Thus, any alleged failure to understand fully the implications of the letter would not constitute a sufficient basis on which to reinstate the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sing v. Department of the Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 251, 253 n.1 (1991). Further, because the documents submitted by the appellant do not mention the circumstances surrounding the execution of the letter of withdrawal, they do not shed any light on how her pregnancy may have affected her decision to withdraw the appeal.... Nor has the appellant provided medical evidence to support a finding that her pregnancy rendered her unable to understand fully the nature of the withdrawal.[8]...We find that the appellant's allegations and supplemental submissions concerning duress resulting from a physical or emotional condition relating to her pregnancy do not meet her evidentiary burden of showing duress in the withdrawal of her appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4805"></span>[8]&#x2003;In her affidavit, Ms. Lucas-Morse, who represented the appellant in the EEO matter, states that she "believe[s] that [the appellant's] emotional state could have affected her ability to think clearly." [Not] only does the affidavit fail to reveal what, if any, credentials the affiant may have for making a medical finding of mental impairment, her statement regarding the appellant's mental condition is sheer speculation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, 50 MSPR at 679 (psychiatrist's statement that "it is possible that [the employee] may not have been able to make an informed decision" was merely speculative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board properly determined that stress was insufficient to invalidate an agreement, <span class="Italic">Robbins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 502 Fed. Appx. 951, 954-55 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the types of pressures and concerns that Mr. Robbins raised to contest the Agreement were no more than pressures and concerns coincidental to the litigation process. In particular, Mr. Robbins stated: that the dispute caused great stress and anxiety for himself and his family; that litigation was expensive and would become more so if he litigated the matter to a final adjudication; and that the other party had greater resources. These contentions, according to the Board, did not constitute fraud, duress, coercion, or misrepresentation by the Agency to invalidate the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence. Mr. Robbins on appeal raises similar arguments made previously before the Board, but his attempt to relitigate the same issues he waived pursuant to the Agreement is unpersuasive. The record demonstrates that Mr. Robbins waived his age discrimination claim knowingly and voluntarily. Although Mr. Robbins now contends that the Agency's offer for settlement requiring retirement was coercive and therefore, involuntary, that he had an option to refuse the offer for settlement and continue litigating his case weighs against this contention. <span class="Italic">See Whiteman v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 688 F.3d 1336, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("We have repeatedly held that the choice between two unattractive options does not render a decision to retire involuntary.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most significantly, Mr. Robbins was represented by counsel throughout the settlement negotiations, and he and his attorney considered the Agreement before it was finally executed. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Robbins "certifie[d] that he...discussed all aspects of this...[a]greement with his counsel and fully underst[ood] this [a]greement." The Agreement effectively resolved all employment disputes between the Agency and Mr. Robbins. Mr. Robbins cannot now attempt to litigate these issues. Hence, the Board's finding that Mr. Robbins failed to show fraud, duress, coercion, or misrepresentation was not arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the Board's holding that jurisdiction was lacking in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parks v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 60, 64-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10, 2010 MSPB 6 (2010), considered evidence offered by the agency of the course of settlement discussions and determined that the appellant did not adequately demonstrate that he lacked the comprehension necessary to enter into an oral settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's petition fails to provide a basis for granting review. Essentially, the appellant has argued both below and on review that his medical condition prevented him from having the mental capacity necessary to enter into a valid settlement agreement. A party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement, however, bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidating it. <span class="Italic">Potter v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 374, &#x00B6; 5 (2009). Further, a party to a settlement agreement is presumed to have full legal capacity to contract unless he is mentally disabled, and the mental disability is so severe that he cannot form the necessary intent. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has not met his heavy burden of invalidating the oral settlement based upon his inability to form the necessary intent because of his diabetes. As the administrative judge found, the agency submitted affidavits from its officials who participated in the settlement negotiations, and all of them stated that the appellant did not exhibit any confusion during the negotiations, that he was able to follow the discussion and argue his points cogently, and that the appellant, in fact, offered the term that he later claimed caused confusion. The administrative judge, therefore, appropriately concluded that this evidence outweighed the appellant's unsupported claim that his mental state precluded him from entering into a valid settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's petition does not provide a basis for disturbing this conclusion. Neither his allegation of his representative's telephone problem nor his reiteration of his mental state outweighs the sworn statements of the agency witnesses present during the negotiations. While the appellant has now submitted for the first time a medical statement indicating that he is unable to comprehend verbal or written language when his blood sugar is too high or too low, the appellant has not explained why he could not have presented this evidence before the record closed below, and the Board need not consider it now. <span class="Italic">See Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980). In any event, this evidence does not establish that the appellant, in fact, suffered from fluctuations in his blood sugar during the settlement negotiations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering but rejecting a claim that the appellant was incompetent to enter into a settlement, <span class="Italic">Ray v. DHHS</span>, 57 MSPR 16, 20-21 (1993), concluded that stress, depression, or illness do not equate to mental incompetence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties. Parties to an agreement are presumed to have full legal capacity to contract unless under guardianship, an infant, mentally ill or defective or intoxicated. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 12(2) (1979). The contract is valid unless the mental disability is so extreme that an individual cannot form the necessary intent. In any case, the burden of proof of incompetency is on the party asserting incompetency. Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 15 cmt. (c) (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the appellant entered into the settlement agreement in October 1991, he was represented by counsel. At no time during these settlement talks or during this period of time did the appellant or his counsel indicate that the appellant was not mentally capable of entering into the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the record is devoid of any evidence from the appellant's physician or from any other source that supports the appellant's claim of incompetence. Nowhere in any of the physician's statements submitted by the appellant is there any indication that the appellant was incompetent.... There is no evidence, medical or otherwise, to establish that the appellant was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement he entered into with the agency or unable to assist his representative in regard to the settlement agreement or any of the issues pending before the Board. Therefore, the appellant has not met his burden of establishing his claim that he was not competent to enter into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dean v.

The appellant has provided no evidence to support his bare allegation that he has diabetes or that a high blood sugar level rendered him mentally incapable of entering into the settlement agreement.

<p class="Body-Text">A challenge to a settlement based on alleged mental incompetency was rejected, <span class="Italic">Rosado v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 455, 459-60 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As relevant here, a party to an agreement is presumed to have full legal capacity to contract unless he is mentally disabled and that mental disability is so severe that he cannot form the necessary intent<span class="Italic">. See Ray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 57 MSPR 16, 20 (1993). When assessing an appellant's claim of mental disability as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board considers whether at the time of the agreement the appellant was represented and whether the appellant has shown mental impairment or inability to understand the nature of the agreement or to assist his or her representative in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Wallace v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 MSPR 676, 678 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here was represented by a union steward. Indeed the transcript of the hearing shows that the administrative judge asked both the appellant and his union representative if they understood the agreement and freely entered into it, and they both said that they did. Further, there is no evidence from the appellant's physician or from any other source that supports the appellant's claim of incompetence. While the notes from Dr. Romeu and Dr. Ximenes show that the appellant suffered from anxiety since 1979 and that he needed to work in an environment without too much stress, they provide no indication that the appellant was incompetent to enter into an agreement in April 1991. Similarly, the October 26, 1981 note of Dr. Ximenes that the appellant has been taking medication "off and on as he deems needed," provides no indication of the appellant's alleged mental incompetence as it does not describe the medication, but does indicate that the appellant may continue working, albeit on a permanent day shift. Further, the note predates the agreement by 10 years. Additionally, the record contains a copy of an order for two prescription medications, diazepam and a combination drug consisting of acetaminophen, caffeine and butalbital, but both orders are dated 1995. Thus, they have no bearing on the appellant's competency on April 11, 1991, the day he entered into the settlement agreement. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to sustain his burden of establishing his claim that his mind was so impaired as to invalidate the settlement agreement.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A factor the Board relies on to ascertain claims of mental incapacity to settle is whether the appellant was represented during the period when the settlement was negotiated. Claims that a settlement was not understood by the appellant because of her mental condition will not be accepted without specific evidence that the appellant was unable either to fully understand the nature of the agreement or assist her representative in the appeal. Evidence that the appellant suffered from emotional distress or emotional problems that were arguably sufficient to disable her from working is not necessarily sufficient to set aside a settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harmon v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 44 MSPR 408, 412 (1990) ("To the extent that the appellant seems to be asserting that he was incapable of understanding the settlement negotiations or assisting his attorney in this regard, we note that the appellant was represented by counsel, and neither the appellant nor his counsel indicated that he was unable to assist in his defense because of a physical or mental condition."); <span class="Italic">Moran v.

Of an attempt to set aside a settlement based on a mental condition, the Federal Circuit remarked as to conclusory assertions, <span class="Italic">Plasai v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 228 Fed. Appx. 976, 978 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...For example, Ms. Plasai alleges that she suffers from a mental condition that impaired her judgment and that the AJ coerced her. However, these allegations, conclusory and perfunctory at best, do not offset the fact that Ms. Plasai was represented by counsel during the settlement agreement and before the AJ; signed the agreement after acknowledging it was freely made; and told the AJ at the settlement enforcement hearing that she freely entered into and understood the terms of the agreement. While we are sympathetic to Ms. Plasai's alleged medical condition, we conclude that the Board did not err in its dismissal of Ms. Plasai's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may consider the appellant's actions during settlement negotiations to determine whether it should credit claimed mental incapacity, <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 546, 554 &#x00B6; 13 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to her mental state at the time of the settlement agreement, the appellant argues that an agency psychologist noted that she has a predisposition to conform to the wishes of others. However, a party to an agreement is presumed to have full legal capacity to contract unless she is mentally disabled and that mental disability is so severe that she cannot form the necessary intent<span class="Italic">. See Rosado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 455, 459 (1996). The record on review contains several assessments prepared by various mental health professionals in 1998. While several of these assessments concluded that the appellant suffered from stress and depression, none suggested that the appellant's mental difficulties were so severe that she could not form contractual intent. In addition, the appellant offered no medical evidence to suggest that her condition had deteriorated to the point where she was unable to form such intent at the time she agreed to settle her appeal. Furthermore, during the settlement conference, the appellant managed to get the agency to agree to include the previous 5-day suspension in the settlement agreement, despite the fact that this adverse action was not before the Board. The record suggests that the appellant was capable of understanding the nature of the settlement and of actively participating in the settlement discussions. Therefore, although the appellant was unrepresented during these discussions, we find that the appellant has failed to establish that the settlement agreement should be invalidated on the grounds of emotional distress.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A disappointed appellant was unable to avoid a settlement through generalized claims of stress, <span class="Italic">Bynum v. VA</span>, 77 MSPR 662, 665-66 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties that may be set aside or voided only on the basis of certain limited grounds, including fraud, coercion, or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Ernest v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 346, 350 (1996). To establish that a settlement was fraudulent as a result of coercion or duress, a party must prove that she involuntarily accepted the other party's terms, that circumstances permitted no other alternative, and that such circumstances were the result of the other party's coercive acts. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Candelaria v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 31 MSPR 412, 413 (1986). Further, where an appellant alleges emotional distress as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board considers whether she was represented below, whether she has demonstrated that she was mentally impaired at the time of the settlement, and whether she has otherwise shown that she was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist her representative in the appeal<span class="Italic">. See Short v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 214, 219 (1995).
