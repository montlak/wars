<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-338"><span class="space">A.</span> INTERFERENCE, RESTRAINT, AND COERCION</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA maintains that &#x00A7; 7105(g) and 7118 vest it with broad powers to remedy violations of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq. XVIII Airborne Corps and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 43 FLRA 1414, 1419 (1992) (directing retroactive promotion and make whole remedy). Summarizing the law on remedies, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 60th AMB, Travis AFB and AFGE Local 1764</span>, 59 FLRA 632, 639 (2004), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority has previously found that "the Statute provides the Authority the discretion to fashion remedies as long as such remedies are consistent with the purposes and policies of the Statute" even where such remedies may otherwise impact a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2).<span class="Italic"> BOP, Washington, D.C., </span>55 FLRA at 1256 (then-Member Cabaniss dissenting on other grounds). In this respect, the Authority has found that &#x00A7; 7106(a) limits the scope of bargaining rather than limiting the Authority's ability to issue remedial orders pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1256-58. Accordingly, we find that the Judge's decision limiting the Agency's ability to commit unfair labor practices by precluding it from engaging in discriminatory or retaliatory assignments is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Back Pay Act is a significant adjunct to the remedial powers of FLRA, it is not an exclusive source of remedial authority. This was pointed out in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Enlisted Records and Evaluation Ctr., Ft. Benjamin Harrison, and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 41 FLRA 885, 899-901 (1991) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273 (D.C. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 7105(g) and 7118 of the Statute vest the Authority with broad powers to remedy violations of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Specifically, section 7105(g)(3) provides that in carrying out its functions under the Statute, the Authority may "require an agency...to take any remedial action it considers appropriate to carry out the policies of this chapter." Further, section 7118(a)(7) specifies the remedies available in unfair labor practice cases and includes "such other action as will carry out the purposes of this chapter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to these provisions of the Statute, the Authority has previously ordered monetary reimbursement for losses that are not covered by the Back Pay Act when the losses resulted from the agency's unlawful action and when such reimbursement was not shown to be inconsistent with another law. <span class="Italic">See, for example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. and U.S. Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Boston, Massachusetts</span>, 37 FLRA 25, 41 (1990) (reimbursement was ordered for monies spent to pay for water coolers when the agency ceased providing water coolers without providing the union with notice and an opportunity to bargain about the change); <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway, Utah</span>, 23 FLRA 578 (1986) (reimbursement was ordered for increased expenses caused when employees at a remote station were illegally evicted from government housing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that the Authority may grant make-whole relief to employees adversely affected by an agency's failure to bargain over the impact and implementation of a change in conditions of employment. Noting that the Authority's role in adjudicating unfair labor practice cases in the federal sector is similar to the National Labor Relations Board's role in the private sector, the court stated that there is "a weighty preference in favor of a direct grant of individualized 'make whole' relief--especially in the form of a monetary award--for losses actually suffered by employees." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, SSA Council 220 v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 925, 930 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Statute authorizes the Authority to exercise broad powers in remedying unfair labor practices and as the Respondents have cited no law precluding the Authority from granting the Judge's remedy in the circumstances of this case, we adopt the Judge's recommended remedy. We note that a direct causal connection has been established between the Respondents' unlawful action and the losses to employees. In this regard, the Judge credited testimony of the Union's Vice President that the implementation of the changes in pay procedures "caused some employees to miss their scheduled car or rent payments which resulted in late charges being assessed." Therefore, in addition to providing for a cease and desist order, we will require Respondent FAO to reimburse employees for the increased costs that they incurred when Respondent FAO implemented the changes in pay procedures prior to the completion of bargaining on Proposal 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondents' argument that the remedy is contrary to the Back Pay Act or is otherwise inconsistent with law. As we noted above, the Authority has ordered monetary reimbursement for losses that are not covered by the Back Pay Act in situations where there was no showing that such reimbursement was inconsistent with another law. We also reject the Respondents' reliance on Comptroller General decisions stating that the United States Government may not reimburse employees for monetary losses when such payments were not authorized by statute or regulation. The Comptroller General decisions relied on by the Respondents do not apply to this case because, as we stated previously, reimbursing employees for their monetary losses in this case is consistent with the broad remedial powers authorized by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note the Respondents' claim that the remedy is deficient because the Judge's decision contains no specific findings on damages. However, we agree with the General Counsel that disputes over actual losses to employees may be resolved during the compliance stage of the proceedings in this unfair labor practice case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Soldier Support Ctr., Ft. Benjamin Harrison and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 41 FLRA 926, 944-45 (1991), FLRA ordered, without the support of the Back Pay Act, a remedy designed to reimburse employees for interest charges they incurred following the agency's failure to bargain over changes to paycheck delivery schedules. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Soldier Support Ctr., Ft. Benjamin Harrison, Office of the Director of Fin. and Accounting, Indianapolis and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 48 FLRA 6, 23-24 (1993), ordered a monetary remedy outside the Reform Act to compensate employees for financial losses they incurred when the agency unilaterally changed its pay system. These rulings did not last long, for they were set aside in court.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">AFGE 1411</span> decisional series was reversed by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273, 275-79 (D.C. Cir. 1995). The court decided that FLRA's exercise of remedial authority in those cases did not overcome the doctrine of sovereign immunity. FLRA could not award damages to those employees who incurred losses as a result of the changes by their employers in the timing of salary transmittals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;Waiver</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA makes two waiver arguments.&#x2003;First, the Authority argues that the Army waived its claim to sovereign immunity by appealing before the FLRA to defend its position on the merits. While it is true that the sovereign immunity of a State is waived by appearance in a federal court, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Barnard</span>, 108 U.S. 436, 447, 2 S. Ct. 878, 888, 27 L. Ed. 780 (1883), federal sovereign immunity is not waived by appearance in any forum because "officers of the United States possess no power through their actions to waive an immunity of the United States or to confer jurisdiction on a court in the absence of some express provision of <span id="page_1601"></span>Congress." <span class="Italic">United States v. N.Y. Rayon Importing Co.</span>, 329 U.S. 654, 660, 67 S. Ct. 601, 604, 91 L. Ed. 577 (1947); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 215-16, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 2967-68, 77 L. Ed.2d 580 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also argues that the Army waived its right to present a sovereign immunity argument to this court by failing to raise it first before the agency.&#x2003;There, the Army made the general argument that the proposed remedy is not authorized by the Statute, but it did not raise the more specific sovereign immunity claim. Although the Statute does provide that except in "extraordinary circumstances" the reviewing court is not to consider an argument that was not raised before the FLRA, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7123(c), this provision cannot bar a belated claim of sovereign immunity. If it could, then as with a waiver by appearance, a federal official could effectively waive sovereign immunity and confer jurisdiction upon the court without an express authorization from the Congress. <span class="Italic">See United States v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co.</span>, 309 U.S. 506, 513, 60 S. Ct. 653, 657, 84 L. Ed. 894 (1940) (rejecting claim that federal government waived sovereign immunity by failing to raise it in district court lest "Government [be subject] to suit in any court in the discretion of its responsible officers [which] is not permissible"). We hold, therefore, that the Army did not waive its sovereign immunity argument by failing to raise it before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;The Government v. The Government</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA next contends that there is no sovereign immunity in "the 'government-against-government' situation" before us because the doctrine of sovereign immunity "was designed for the purpose of protecting the government from litigation initiated by a source outside the government's direct control--its citizens," and not to protect one Government agency from litigation initiated by another. This argument invokes an unduly circumscribed notion of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gray v. Bell</span>, 712 F.2d 490, 511 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (setting forth three policy bases of sovereign immunity). Not even the FLRA's account of the doctrine, however, suggests that the sovereign is immune only to lawsuits brought by private parties, and not to a suit such as this, brought by a government official acting for the benefit of private parties. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Horn</span>, 29 F.3d 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1994) (sovereign immunity "stands as an obstacle to virtually all direct assaults against the public fisc, save only those incursions from time to time authorized by Congress"). Hence, the Army enjoys sovereign immunity in this instance unless the Congress has waived it, which is the thrust of the FLRA's final argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">C.&#x2003;The Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority argues that the Congress, in enacting the Statute, waived the Government's immunity to the kind of remedy it ordered in this case. Because the Congress can waive immunity to one type of remedy without waiving immunity to another, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., United States v. Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S. 30, 112 S. Ct. 1011, 117 L. Ed.2d 181 (1992), it is important, as a threshold matter, to understand the remedy at issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority ordered the Army to compensate its employees for "all monies lost or interest charged as a result" of the change in the Army's pay-lag policy. This is properly understood as "money damages," a legal rather than an equitable remedy. <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Massachusetts</span>, 487 U.S. 879, 893, 895, 108 S. Ct. 2722, 2731-32, 2732-33, 101 L. Ed.2d 749 (1988) ("money damages" "refers to a sum of money used as compensatory relief...given to the plaintiff as a <span class="Italic">substitute </span>for a suffered loss" in an action at law for damages) (quoting <span class="Italic">Maryland Dept. of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 763 F.2d 1441, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (emphasis in original)). Money damages are the "classic remedy" for consequential losses. <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 982 F.2d 531, 533 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>). The remedy in an equitable action for specific relief, on the other hand, does not attempt to provide the injured party with a substitute for a consequential loss, but rather "attempt[s] to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled." <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, 487 U.S. at 895, 108 S. Ct. at 2732; <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span>, 982 F.2d at 533 (both quoting D. DOBBS, <span class="Italic">Handbook on the Law of Remedies </span>135 (1973)). Thus, a monetary award can be either legal or equitable in nature, depending upon whether the money is a substitute for something lost in consequence of the defendant's act or is "the very thing to which [the plaintiff] is entitled." <span class="Italic">Maryland Dept. of Human Resources</span>, 763 F.2d at 1446.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, proper notice of the pay-lag policy change was the thing to which the commissary employees were entitled. The interest charges for which the employees seek compensation are sums they lost only as a consequence of the Army's failure to give them the notice they were due. Accordingly, any compensation for such interest is properly characterized as "money damages." Hence, the question before the court is whether the Statute waives the immunity of the United States to liability for money damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The section of the Statute that sets out the powers and duties of the FLRA provides that the Authority "may require an agency or a labor organization to cease and desist from violations of this chapter and require it to take any remedial action it considers appropriate to carry out the policies of this chapter." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7105(g)(3). The section that addresses the prevention of unfair labor practices further provides that if the Authority finds that an agency or a labor organization has committed an unfair labor practice it shall issue an order:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;to cease and desist...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order...;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;requiring reinstatement of an employee with backpay...; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;including any combination of the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7). The FLRA argues that by enacting these two provisions the Congress waived the Government's immunity to money damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The two provisions, and particularly the phrases "any remedial action" and "such other action" in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7105(g)(3) and 7118(a)(7)(D) respectively, do seem to provide the FLRA with a broad range of remedial powers. Indeed, as the FLRA correctly notes, we have more than once said that they "exude indications of a broad congressional delegation of discretion to the FLRA to fashion appropriate remedies for an unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">FDIC v. FLRA, </span>977 F.2d 1493, 1498 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>)); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Gov't Employees, SSA Council 220 v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 925, 928 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (hereinafter <span class="Italic">SSA Council 220</span>). The issue before us, however, is not the breadth but the clarity of those provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to waive sovereign immunity the Congress must "unequivocally express[&#8197;]" its desire to do so. <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 95, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457, 112 L. Ed.2d 435(1990). This expression must appear on the face of the statute; it cannot be discerned in (lest it be concocted out of) legislative history. <span class="Italic">Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S. at 37, 112 S. Ct. at 1016. The Government's consent to a particular remedy must be unambiguous as well, <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 34-36, 112 S. Ct. at 1014-16, and, in determining the scope of a partial waiver, "the Government's consent must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign and not enlarged beyond what the language requires<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 34, 112 S. Ct. at 1015; <span class="Italic">accord Ardestani v. INS</span>, 502 U.S. 129, 137, 112 S. Ct. at 515, 520-21, 116 L. Ed.2d 496 (1991). For the FLRA to prevail in this case, therefore, the statutory waiver provision must unambiguously establish that it extends to the award of money damages. <span class="Italic">See Dorsey v. Department of Labor</span>, 41 F.3d 1551 (D.C. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">cf. Nordic</span> <span class="Italic">Village</span>, 503 U.S. at 34, 112 S. Ct. at 1014-15. An Act of Congress is not unambiguous, and thus does not waive immunity, if it will bear any "plausible" alternative interpretation<span class="Italic">. See Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S. at 34, 112 S. Ct. at 1014-15....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So now the question is whether the phrases "such other action" and "any remedial action" necessarily constitute an express and unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity to an award of money damages. The answer is clearly negative; the term "action" is simply not clear or specific enough to support such a waiver. While the Congress might have intended "action" to have its broadest possible meaning, so that literally any remedy including money damages could be imposed by the FLRA, it is also plausible that the Congress intended to give the FLRA the power to impose only equitable remedies, which normally require the offending agency to take some "action." Indeed, the latter interpretation gains support by contrast with statutes in which the Congress has unequivocally expressed its desire to waive sovereign immunity to money damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(g) (providing specific authority for Merit Systems Protection Board to award "reimbursement for attorney's fees, back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages"); <span class="Italic">see also </span>42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1) ("complaining party [in a civil rights case] may recover compensatory and punitive damages").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both sides agree that &#x00A7; 10(c), the remedial provision of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 USC &#x00A7; 160(c), is "strikingly similar" to the provisions at issue here. Section 10(c) provides that upon finding an unfair labor practice, the NLRB shall order the violator "to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of [the Act]...." Two circuits have squarely held that this provision does not authorize the NLRB to award compensatory money damages. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Ford Motor Co.</span>, 684 F.2d 1355, 1364 (11th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Harrington v. Vandalia-Butler Board of Educ.</span>, 585 F.2d 192, 196-97 (6th Cir. 1978) (in banc); <span class="Italic">see also Protos v. Volkswagen of America</span>, 797 F.2d 129, 138 (3rd Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Musikiwamba v. ESSI, Inc.</span>, 760 F.2d 740, 748 (7th Cir. 1985). As the FLRA correctly notes, the NLRB has nonetheless continued to order the payment of compensatory money damages in some cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., BRC Injected Rubber Products, Inc.</span>, 311 NLRB 66, 1993 WL 169671 (1993). Of course, the correct interpretation of &#x00A7; 10(c) is not before this court today and we offer no opinion on the issue. We do think, however, that the split in authority reflects the ambiguity of the term "action." If the scope of that term is so unclear that the courts and the Board cannot agree upon its meaning in that "strikingly similar" context, then <span id="page_1602"></span>it is difficult to see how it could be sufficiently unambiguous to effect a waiver of sovereign immunity for money damages here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also invokes <span class="Italic">Loeffler v. Frank</span>, 486 U.S. 549, 108 S. Ct. 1965, 100 L. Ed.2d 549 (1988), suggesting that the Supreme Court there found a waiver of sovereign immunity from payment of prejudgment interest in Title VII suits upon the basis of a statute that merely authorized the court to "order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,...including back pay...or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate." 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g) (1988). This claim is extremely misleading. The Court in <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span> did not hold that the Congress waived sovereign immunity upon the basis of the just-quoted remedial provision. Rather, the Court held that the Congress waived the Postal Service's immunity to prejudgment interest when it passed the "sue-and-be-sued" provision of the Postal Reorganization Act. 486 U.S. at 554-58, 108 S. Ct. at 1968-71. The Court noted that such clauses are deemed to waive immunity because they bespeak the intent of the Congress to treat a governmental entity engaged in a commercial activity as though it were a private actor<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 556, 108 S. Ct. at 1969-70. (Subsequently the Court explained that the sue-and-be-sued clause is a specific exception to the general rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign. <span class="Italic">Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S. at 34, 112 S. Ct. at 1014-15.) The Court specifically stated that there was no provision in Title VII itself sufficiently express and unambiguous to waive sovereign immunity from liability for prejudgment interest. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 565, 112 S. Ct. at 1974-75. In truth, therefore, <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span> supports the conclusion that the Statute (like Title VII before it was amended in 1991) is not necessarily a waiver of sovereign immunity for all seasons, but rather a waiver of at best uncertain reach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also offers a contextual argument to support its interpretation of the Statute, in the hope that context can supply the "unequivocal expression" lacking in the text. The Authority claims that because &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7) authorizes it to award back pay, which is at least sometimes a form of money damages, <span class="Italic">see Hubbard</span>, 982 F.2d at 533 &#x0026; n.4, the phrase "other action" denotes other forms of money damages in addition to back pay. As the Army notes, however, the Statute directly ties the back pay remedy to an award of reinstatement. Because all three specifically enumerated remedies--a cease and desist order, a bargaining order, and an order of reinstatement--are equitable, the Army argues that "other action[s]" means only other equitable actions. Both interpretations certainly are plausible, but neither is compelling. Consequently, the statutory context does not cure the facial ambiguity of the text, i.e. of the term "action."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the FLRA suggests that because we have in prior decisions "recognized that the Statute allows the Authority to fashion make-whole money remedies other than back pay," we must read the Statute now to waive the Government's immunity to the damage remedy at issue here. In particular, the FLRA points to our statement in <span class="Italic">SSA Council 220</span>, 840 F.2d at 930, that there is "a weighty preference in favor of a direct grant of individualized 'make whole' relief--especially in the form of a monetary award--for losses actually suffered by employees." The make whole monetary award at issue in that case, however, was "back pay or other individualized equitable relief<span class="Italic">." Id</span>., The case has no bearing, therefore, upon the question whether the legal remedy of money damages other than back pay is available under the Statute. The same is true of <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 785 F.2d 333, 337 (D.C. Cir. 1986), where we suggested in a <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that the FLRA should "typically grant monetary relief, such as backpay, in addition to any order to bargain." Because the only monetary relief at issue in that case was back pay itself, the statement concerning "monetary relief' is ambiguous. It might refer broadly to consequential money damages or narrowly to equitable specific relief; in either event, it remains a <span class="Italic">dictum</span>. A decision that the Congress waived the Government's sovereign immunity to money damages in the Statute, therefore, is not to be founded upon the prior decisions of this court.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">INS, Los Angeles and AFGE Local 505</span>, 52 FLRA 103, 105-06 (1996), determined that a remedial order could not, according to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army v. FLRA, supra</span>, encompass recoupment of the expenses of employees following the discontinuation of free parking: no statute waived sovereign immunity so as to require the agency to reimburse parking expenses to employees. <span class="Italic">INS</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 2400</span>, 55 FLRA 1213, 1216 (2000), determining that there was a difference between a payment for expenses incurred by employees for commercial parking and equitable reimbursement of money paid to the government for increased parking fees that were imposed without impact negotiations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent does not dispute the Judge's finding that it unilaterally implemented an increase in parking rates at VA Nashville without negotiating with the Union over the impact and implementation of the change. Consequently, and in agreement with the Judge, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. We further agree with the Judge's finding that, to remedy the violation, the <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>should be restored. This remedy would return the employee parking rate to $7.50 per month. However, we disagree with the Judge's decision not to order that adversely affected employees be made whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the General Counsel, the Judge erroneously concluded that a make-whole remedy was not appropriate because, pursuant to <span class="Italic">INS, </span>52 FLRA 103, "it [constitutes] an attempt to award money damages in a different guise." We find that the Judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">INS </span>is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">INS, </span>the respondent was found to have violated the Statute by discontinuing its practice of providing free parking on its property without bargaining over the decision. As a result, employees incurred additional expenses because they were required to pay for parking in private parking lots. To remedy the violation, the General Counsel requested that the employees be reimbursed for their parking fees. In rejecting the General Counsel's reimbursement request, the Authority noted that "[t]he United States is immune from liability for money damages under the doctrine of sovereign immunity." 52 FLRA at 104 (citing <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena, </span>518 U.S. 187 (1996). The Authority further noted that in <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, United States Army Commissary, Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, et al. v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273 (D.C. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">vacating in part </span>48 FLRA 6 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Department of the Army v. FLRA</span>), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explicitly found that the Statute does not waive sovereign immunity to an award of money damages unless such damages are based on an unlawful reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials under the Back Pay Act. 52 FLRA at 106. As there was no contention that the remedy sought--the reimbursement of parking expenses incurred as a result of the unfair labor practice--was based on such a loss under the Back Pay Act, the Authority concluded that the doctrine of sovereign immunity barred the requested relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">INS, </span>the Authority discussed the difference between money damages and equitable relief<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region,</span> <span class="Italic">Renton, Washington, </span>55 FLRA 293, 298-99 (1999), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed, </span>No. 99-1165 (D.C. Cir. April 29, 1999) <span class="Italic">(FAA). </span>Money damages, the Authority noted, have been characterized as a payment to a plaintiff of a sum of money for "'something lost <span class="Italic">in consequence of</span> the defendant's act'" and "'as a substitute for a suffered loss in an action at law for damages.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 298 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of the Army v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d at 276) (emphasis in original). On the other hand, the Authority noted that a remedy in an equitable action "attempt[s] to give the plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled<span class="Italic">." Id. See also Maryland Department of Human</span> <span class="Italic">Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, </span>763 F.2d 1441, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the remedy in <span class="Italic">INS, </span>the make-whole relief requested in this case does not involve a monetary payment to adversely affected employees. Rather, the requested remedy would require the Respondent to reduce the rates charged to employees for a period of time necessary to offset the difference between the unlawfully implemented rate--$10.96 per pay period--and the former rate--$3.46 per pay period--until such time as the employees have been fully reimbursed. Offsets are typically viewed as equitable in nature<span class="Italic">. See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., HAL, Inc. v. United States, </span>122 F.3d 851, 854 (9th Cir. 1997). Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">FAA, </span>we conclude that the requested remedy is equitable in nature and that the Judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">INS </span>is misplaced.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In arriving at this result, we specifically note that remedies for unfair labor practices should be designed to "restore, so far as possible, the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>that would have obtained but for the wrongful act<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J.H. Rutter-Rex</span> <span class="Italic">Manufacturing Co., </span>396 U.S. 258, 265 (1969).

FLRA, </span>840 F.2d 925, 930 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (the denial of make-whole relief "should prove exceptional").</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming neither pay entitlement nor a related sovereign immunity problem, FLRA does what it can to make employees whole for the difficulties caused them by ULPs committed by their employers. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and AFGE Local 2640</span>, 54 FLRA 987, 1021-22 (1998), explained, as to extensive interference with the protected rights of a union official, the types of remedies and processes available to FLRA:</p>

NLRB</span>, 365 U.S. 651, 657 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Remedies must also "effectuate the policies of the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 445. Remedies may not, however, be punitive. <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 160.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1603"></span>"The Authority has developed several 'traditional' remedies" that meet these criteria. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 161. Most common is the "cease-and-desist order accompanied by the posting of a notice to employees, which are provided in virtually all cases where a violation is found<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Also among the "traditional" remedies are those that require specific action such as "the grant of back pay," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, or, in discrimination cases like the instant case, a "make-whole" remedy. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Grissom</span>, 51 FLRA at 13 ("The Authority will order a make-whole remedy where there is discrimination in connection with conditions of employment based on unlawful consideration of protected union activity....")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fundamental consideration in formulating remedies is whether the traditional remedy will "adequately redress the wrong incurred by the unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 444. As part of this consideration, the Authority examines the requested "nontraditional" remedy and analyzes "whether the remedy is reasonably necessary and would be effective to 'recreate the conditions and relationships' with which the unfair labor practice interfered, as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct." <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 161 (quoting <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 444-45). This analysis is done under the assumption that there "exist no legal or public policy objections to a proposed, nontraditional remedy." 52 FLRA at 161. Because the questions under this approach are "essentially factual," the Authority evaluates them "by considering the record evidence, arguments to the Judge, and any exceptions to the Judge's decision." <span class="Italic">DVA</span>, 52 FLRA at 186. Also, "[a]s with other factual questions, the General Counsel bears the burden of persuasion, and the Judge is responsible for initially determining whether the remedy is warranted." <span class="Italic">F.E</span>. Warren, 52 FLRA at 161.</p>

<p class="noindent">The importance of a make whole remedy was emphasized in <span class="Italic">VAMC Martinsburg and NFFE Lodge 1798</span>, 67 FLRA 400, 402-03 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting), involving an official time and telework dispute, leaving to compliance proceedings calculation of the loss to be made whole for a union official:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated that "when an issue is properly raised as [a ULP] under [&#x00A7;] 7116 [of the Statute], nothing therein would prevent the Authority from remedying any violation found."[24] Moreover, the Authority has held that remedies for ULPs should, "like those under the [National Labor Relations Act], be 'designed to recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no [ULP].'"[25] The Authority has also stated that the purpose of ULP remedies is to restore, "as far as possible, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> that would have obtained" if the violation had not been committed.[26] Among other "traditional remedies," the Authority has recognized a "make-whole" remedy where there is "discrimination in connection with conditions of employment based on unlawful consideration of protected union activity."[27] Further, both the Authority[28] and the NLRB[29] have held that determining whether employees actually suffered a loss as a result of a ULP is a matter that may be resolved in compliance proceedings.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Judge concluded that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute as alleged. Despite this finding, the Judge rejected the GC's proposed make-whole remedy. As stated previously, according to the Judge, because the complaint and the remaining "record" lacked an allegation or evidence regarding any use of annual or sick leave, the Respondent did not admit that any leave was used. The Judge also found that the employee's injury did not support a conclusion that the Respondent "forced" the employee to use leave, because the employee could have used other "methodologies" to report for duty. Further, the Judge determined that it was not unreasonable to expect the Union president on 100% official time to come to the office during the work week. Finally, the Judge found that the "pleadings indicate" that the Respondent was obligated only to negotiate over telework for union officials, not to permit union officials to telework five days a week or to grant every telework request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as the Judge found that the Respondent committed a ULP, a make-whole remedy is appropriate under the circumstances of this case.[36] And any questions regarding whether the employee actually suffered a loss as a result of the violation can be resolved in compliance proceedings.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Davis-Monthan</span>, 64 FLRA at 361.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Adopting the Judge's conclusion would wholly deny the employee potential make-whole relief. To the extent that the Judge concluded that the complaint and the remaining "record" lacked an allegation or evidence regarding any use of annual or sick leave, or that the employee's injury should not have resulted in her using leave, such factual determinations as to the employee's use of <span class="Italic">any</span> leave are left for the compliance stage. And the Judge's conclusions that it was not unreasonable to expect the Union president on official time to come to the office during the work week, and that the "pleadings indicate[d]" that the Respondent was obligated only to <span class="Italic">negotiate</span> regarding telework for union officials, are inconsistent with his finding that the denial of telework violated the Statute. The finding of the violation necessarily implies that the Respondent could not require the employee to come in to the office or refuse to grant the employee's request to telework five days a week in the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we leave for compliance proceedings the determination of any specified losses and other appropriate relief for the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3283</span>, the Authority rejected an administrative law judge's decision to deny a make-whole remedy for monetary loss.[40] In that decision, the Authority found that because the nature of the violation was solely that the respondent violated the Statute by failing to "advis[e]" the grievants, the respondent's violation "<span class="Italic">could not have resulted in a loss of pay, allowances[,]</span><span class="Italic"> or differentials</span>."[41] By contrast, here, the nature of the violation was that the Respondent discriminated against the employee by refusing her request to telework five days per week because she could not bear weight on one ankle or drive a car. This violation <span class="Italic">could have resulted</span> in the employee using annual or sick leave. And whether she did so (and if so, how much) is an issue properly resolved through compliance proceedings.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DODDS and OFT</span>, 54 FLRA 259, 269-70 (1998), emphasizing the broad remedial authority of FLRA, required that overseas employees be provided reassignment options to overcome problems for them that resulted when the agency failed to comply with, or reneged on, a grievance settlement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has defined the broad objectives that an unfair labor practice remedy should be designed to serve.&#x2003;The General Counsel has correctly pointed to <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Safford, Arizona</span>, 35 FLRA 431, 445 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Safford</span>), wherein the Authority stated that "remedies for unfair labor practices under the Statute should, like those under the NLRA, be 'designed to recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unfair labor practice.'" <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 444-45 (quoting <span class="Italic">Local 60, United Brotherhood of Carpenters &#x0026; Joiners v. NLRB</span>, 365 U.S. 651, 657 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring)). The Authority further stated that remedies should be designed to "restore, so far as possible, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> that would have obtained but for the wrongful act." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 445 (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J.H. Rutter-Rex Manufacturing Co.</span>, 396 U.S. 258, 265 (1969)). In addition, the Authority has noted that although the deterrence of future violative conduct is not in itself the principal objective of a remedial order, it "is also certainly a desirable effect[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 160 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that the Respondent violated the Statute by "intentionally and purposefully" refusing to accord Foley and Krom the "highest priority in...world-wide transfers/reassignments...to create vacancies" for the return of employees Gronke and Henke-Rebelo in accordance with paragraph one of the settlement agreement. Nevertheless, despite this finding, the Judge specifically determined that it was not appropriate to award Foley and Krom make-whole relief because Gronke and Henke-Rebelo had previously received offers to return to Lajes for the 1996-97 school year. According to the Judge, the purpose of the settlement agreement was to return employees to Lajes, "not to fulfill the desires of Lajes teachers to transfer." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, he concluded that Foley and Krom incurred no loss for which they are entitled to be compensated. In our view, this aspect of the Judge's decision is contrary to the above-stated precedent.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;To the extent that the Judge's decision suggests that employees affected by the repudiation of an agreement must establish that they were the intended beneficiaries of the agreement before they <span id="page_1604"></span>are entitled to relief, it must be rejected. The Judge has cited no authority in support of this proposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Similarly, to the extent that the Judge's decision suggests that affected employees must establish a monetary loss, as opposed to an adverse effect--which could result in losses that are monetary or equitable in nature--it must also be rejected. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has observed,</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[t]he Act imposes on the Authority a clear duty to vindicate employee bargaining rights by making whole employees adversely affected by bargaining violations. Section 7118(a)(7) of the Act expresses in mandatory terms the statute's policy to remedy each violation to the fullest possible extent by providing that the Authority 'shall...order' some combination of relief[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, SSA Council 220 v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 925, 928-29 (D.C. Cir. 1988). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, El Paso District Office</span>, 39 FLRA 1431, 1439 (1991) (ordering agency to rescind any admonishments or disciplinary actions taken against employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that were it not for the Respondent's failure to honor the settlement agreement, Foley and Krom would have been granted the transfers they had requested for the 1995-96 school year. Accordingly, as Foley and Krom were denied a benefit to which they were entitled under the terms of the settlement agreement, we conclude that they were adversely affected by the Respondent's unlawful actions. In order to recreate the conditions and relationships that would have existed had the unfair labor practice not occurred, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, that Foley and Krom are entitled to be placed in the positions they would have been in had the improper action not occurred. Specific relief to which they are entitled includes reassignment to the positions they previously requested, if available, and compensation under the Back Pay Act, if appropriate. As circumstances may have changed since the outset of this proceeding, we leave for compliance the determination of any specific losses and other appropriate relief.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;We note, in this connection, that if the exact positions into which Foley and Krom would have transferred are no longer available, these employees may be offered substantially equivalent positions. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Western Division San Bruno, California</span>, 45 FLRA 138, 160 (1992); <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 39 FLRA 905, 932 (1991).
