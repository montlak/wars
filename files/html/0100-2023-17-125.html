<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-123"><span class="space">A.</span> EXCEPTIONS MUST STATE A RECOGNIZED BASIS FOR REVIEW</h3>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 CFR 2425.6 (2022)<span class="Italic">,</span> the party filing exceptions must provide specific citation to an established basis for review, and support that citation with explanation of its position. This was starkly pointed out in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1738 and VAMC Salisbury</span>, 65 FLRA 975, 975-76 (2011) (Member Beck concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations specifically enumerate the grounds that the Authority currently recognizes for reviewing awards. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(a)-(b). In addition, the Regulations provide that if exceptions argue that an arbitration award is deficient based on private-sector grounds not currently recognized by the Authority, then the excepting party "must provide sufficient citation to legal authority that establishes the grounds upon which the party filed its exceptions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, &#x00A7; 2425.6(e)(1) of the Regulations provides that an exception "may be subject to dismissal or denial if: "...[t]he excepting party fails to raise and support" the grounds listed in &#x00A7; 2425.6(a)-(c), "or otherwise fails to demonstrate a legally recognized basis for setting aside the award[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(e)(1). Thus, an exception that does not raise a recognized ground is subject to dismissal under the Regulations. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 738</span>, 65 FLRA 931, 932 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local 738</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3955, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 887, 889 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">Local 3955</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's contention that the award is "contrary to the plain language of the negotiated agreement[,]" Exception at 5, does not constitute a ground currently recognized by the Authority for reviewing awards.[3] <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(a)-(b). As the Union does not raise a recognized ground or cite legal authority to support a ground not currently recognized by the Authority, we dismiss the exception. <span class="Italic">See Local 738</span>, 65 FLRA at 932; <span class="Italic">Local 3955</span>, 65 FLRA at 889.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In accord with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6, the Authority will "no longer construe parties' exceptions as raising grounds that the exceptions do not raise." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3955, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 887, 889 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part). Thus, as the Union does not allege that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement, we do not address that issue. We note, in this regard, that three of the decisions cited by the concurrence were issued before 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6 went into effect, and are therefore inapposite. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev., Portland, Or.</span>, 64 FLRA 651 (2010) (Member Beck dissenting); <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Falls Church, Va.</span>, 59 FLRA 507 (2003); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 59 FLRA 507 (2003). In the remaining decision cited by the concurrence, the excepting party expressly raised an essence argument. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement</span>, 65 FLRA 529, 530, 534 (2011). Thus, that decision also is inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Beck, concurring in <span class="Italic">Salisbury Med. Ctr.</span>, suggested a different approach, urging that FLRA should construe exceptions in accordance with a clearly-stated objection to the award, even if the objection was not phrased in the manner contemplated by the Statute or by FLRA's regulations, 65 FLRA at 977:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While I agree with my colleagues that the Union's exception should not be granted, I disagree with their conclusion that the Union's exception should be dismissed because it does not raise a private-sector ground that is recognized by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As I stated in my dissent in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 3955, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 887, 891 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">Local 3955</span>), the Authority's revised regulations "do not require parties to invoke any particular magical incantations when filing exceptions." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Union asserts both that the Arbitrator "ignored the plain language" of the parties' agreement and that his award is contrary to "[t]he plain language of Article 20, Section 5[.E.]" of that agreement. Exceptions at 3; <span class="Italic">see also id. </span>at 5 (contending that "[t]he [a]ward is contrary to the plain language of the negotiated agreement")<span class="Italic">. </span>Moreover, the Union claims, the Arbitrator based his determination "on a finding of ambiguity in a contract provision where none exists." These assertions constitute an argument that the Arbitrator's award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 59 FLRA 34, 37 (2003) (award fails to draw its essence from parties' agreement when it is implausible, irrational or in manifest disregard of the agreement). Indeed, in cases involving essence exceptions, the Authority has considered almost identical language to that used by the Union here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement</span>, 65 FLRA 529, 534 (2011) (agency claimed that arbitrator's finding was "contrary to the plain language of [contract] provision"); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., Portland, Or.</span>, 64 FLRA 651, 653 (2010) (Member Beck dissenting) (agency argued that "[a]rbitrator ignored the 'plain language of the MOU'"); <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Falls Church, Va.</span>, 59 FLRA 507, 508-509, 510 (2003) (agency contended that award "ignor[ed] the plain language of [a]rticle 20").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I would find that the award does not fail to draw its essence from the agreement.&#x2003;Article 20, Section 5.E. provides that "[e]mployees will not be required to stay at home or wear and respond to beepers/pagers unless they are in a pay status." The Arbitrator found that this provision requires the Agency to have placed "sufficiently restrictive limits on the movement and off duty activities" of the grievants to warrant placing them in a pay status, i.e. "'on-call.'" The Arbitrator found "no such restrictive limits" had been placed on the grievants.<span class="Italic"> </span>Thus, contrary to the Union's claim, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that he did not ignore Article 20, Section 5.E. Further, the Union has not provided any basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in his interpretation and application of this provision. Accordingly, I would deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Pizzella also argued for a common sense approach to the phrasing of exceptions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal</span>, 68 FLRA 283 (2015), n.4:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Member Pizzella does not agree that the Union does not raise a recognized ground for review.&#x2003;The Union argues that "there was <span class="Italic">no <span id="page_1870"></span>nexus</span> with respect to the [g]rievant's...misconduct...[and] [t]he Agency did not meet the <span class="Italic">threshold of preponderance of the evidence[</span><span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">]</span><span class="Italic"></span> and the <span class="Italic">efficiency of the service</span>." Exceptions at 1 (emphases added). Member Pizzella would conclude that the Union properly presents a contrary-to-law exception, but would deny the exception as failing to demonstrate that the award is deficient on that basis. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1815</span>, 68 FLRA 26, 27 n.18 (2014) (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1897</span>, 67 FLRA 239, 243 (2014) (<span class="Italic">Local 1897</span>) (Concurring Opinion of Member Pizzella) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU v.

<p class="noindent">Another example of dismissal of an exception for lack of technically proper pleading occurred when the union protested that the arbitrator issued an award before the parties received the hearing transcript or submitted closing briefs. The union's protestations were insufficiently specific on the private sector exception, but another exception, based on alleged legal error, was considered in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Aviation &#x0026; Missile Command</span>, 67 FLRA 327, 327-28 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations specifically enumerate the grounds that the Authority currently recognizes for reviewing awards.[11] In addition, the Regulations provide that, if exceptions argue that an arbitration award is deficient based on private-sector grounds not currently recognized by the Authority, then the excepting party "must provide sufficient citation to legal authority that establishes the grounds upon which the party filed its exceptions."[12] Further, &#x00A7; 2425.6(e)(1) of the Regulations provides that an exception "may be subject to dismissal or denial if: [t]he excepting party fails to raise and support" the grounds listed in &#x00A7; 2425.6(a)-(c), "or otherwise fails to demonstrate a legally recognized basis for setting aside the award."[13] Thus, an exception that does not raise a recognized ground is subject to dismissal under the Regulations.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator improperly "made a premature decision" because he issued his award before the parties received the hearing transcript or submitted closing briefs.[15] This contention does not raise a recognized ground for reviewing an award under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(a)-(b), or cite legal authority to support a ground not currently recognized by the Authority. We, therefore, dismiss this exception.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also contends that the Arbitrator "misinterpreted" 5 U.S.C, "Chapter 71 in regard[&#8197;] to the hiring." In this regard, the Union asserts that, although the Agency has a management "right to hire and fire employees," it may not discriminate against a prohibited group or commit a prohibited personnel practice. And according to the Union, pre-selection is a prohibited personnel practice. We find that the Union's argument is sufficient to raise a claim that the award is contrary to law. But we also find that the Union has not supported this claim. In this regard, although the Union cites federal law that the award allegedly violates, the Union does not explain the alleged violation, or how the award is otherwise deficient. Because the Union has failed to support its assertion that the award is contrary to law, we deny this exception under &#x00A7; 2425.6(c) of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member DuBester and Chairman Pope commented on another exception raised in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 67 FLRA at 328, a n.21 and n.22:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[21] Regarding this exception, Member DuBester notes the following: I agree that the Union's claim--that the Arbitrator "did not interpret...the [c]ollective [b]argaining [a]greement correctly," <span class="Italic">id</span>.--suffices to raise a recognized private-sector ground for review of the award; i.e., that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(b)(2). I reach this conclusion cognizant of the Authority's Arbitration Initiative and our revised Regulations that counsel the parties that the Authority no longer construes parties' exceptions as raising recognized grounds for review when the parties have failed to state such grounds. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3955, Counsel of Prison Locals</span> <span class="Italic">33</span>, 65 FLRA 887, 889 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part); <span class="Italic">accord AFGE, Local 1897</span>, 67 FLRA 239, 240 n.19 (2014). As I have stated previously, though, where parties articulate a well-established standard supporting a recognized ground, that action is sufficient to raise a recognized ground under &#x00A7; 2425.6 of the Authority's regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Gen. Comm</span>., 66 FLRA 367, 370 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Gen. Comm</span>.) (finding that the union's claim that the award was not based on "a plausible interpretation of the [parties' agreement]" was sufficient to raise the recognized private-sector ground of essence); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3627</span>, 65 FLRA 1049, 1051 n.2 (2011) (finding that the union's claim that the award failed to "resolve the issues submitted" was sufficient to raise the recognized private-sector ground of exceeds authority). Although I acknowledge that "correct interpretation" does not have the precise meaning of "plausible interpretation," in my view, "interpretation" is central to an arbitrator's proper role and the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &#x0026; Car Corp</span>., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960) (establishing the essence standard). For this reason, accepting the Union's "correct-interpretation" claim as raising the essence ground is reasonable and correct under the law and our Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[22] Chairman Pope finds that this allegation does not raise a "ground[&#8197;]" for finding the award deficient under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2) of the Statute and &#x00A7; 2425.6 of the Authority's Regulations. In this connection, failure to provide a "plausible interpretation" of an agreement is a <span class="Italic">standard</span> that the Authority applies to determine whether an award is deficient under an established ground--failing to draw its essence from the agreement. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOL (OSHA)</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). As the Union has neither cited one of the grounds for review that the Authority recognizes (which are easily found in &#x00A7; 2425.6(a)-(b) of our Regulations) nor provided citation to legal authority that establishes the purported ground on which the Union relies under &#x00A7; 2425.6(c), Chairman Pope would dismiss the exception. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gen. Comm</span>., 66 FLRA at 370 n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent">The need for specific, literal invocation of FLRA regulatory language describing allowable exceptions was again brought home in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Aviation &#x0026; Missile Command</span>, 67 FLRA 330, 331 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations specifically enumerate the grounds that the Authority currently recognizes for reviewing awards.[6] In addition, the Regulations provide that if exceptions argue that an arbitration award is deficient based on private-sector grounds not currently recognized by the Authority, then the excepting party "must provide sufficient citation to legal authority that establishes the grounds upon which the party filed its exceptions."[7]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Arguing the merits of its grievance, the Union contends that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and statutory merit-system principles when it processed the merit promotions of the individual grievants. The Union also contends that the Arbitrator "did not make a decision to resolve the issue of the promotions of the [g]rievants." In accord with &#x00A7; 2425.6 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority "no longer construe[s] parties' exceptions as raising grounds that the exceptions do not raise."[12] Because the Union's contentions do not raise a recognized ground for reviewing an award under5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.6(a)-(b), or cite legal authority to support a ground not currently recognized by the Authority, we dismiss them.[13]</p>
