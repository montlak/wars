<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-120"><span class="space">5.</span> Precautionary Measures</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal reviewed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal Commissary</span>, 27 FLRA 69, 87-88 (1987), was that "[n]o employee, other than qualified maintenance personnel, shall be required to perform repair work on moving operating machines while in motion or operation." Speaking to whether the proposal was an appropriate arrangement, and concluding it was not, FLRA explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The provision contains no references to repair work which would pose imminent dangers to employees' health and safety. It merely prevents management from assigning repair work on <span class="Italic">all</span> moving operating machines to employees other than "qualified maintenance personnel" <span class="Italic">whenever</span> the machines are moving <span class="Italic">or</span> are in operation. Based on its wording, the impact of the provision would extend well beyond those circumstances in which such repair work might pose imminent dangers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reference to <span class="Italic">Whirlpool Corporation v. Marshall</span>, 455 U.S. 1 (1980), in support of its position, is inapposite. The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Whirlpool</span> was solely concerned with whether a private sector employee has a right to be free from discriminatory disciplinary action for refusing work when the employee has a reasonable apprehension of death or serious injury, coupled with a reasonable belief that no less drastic alternative to refusing the work is available.... If this is the intent of the provision, this is what the Union should propose to the Agency for bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA gave some indication in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858</span> that a clause might be constructed to avoid dangerous assignments, as long as the proposal was narrowly drawn. The proposal was that an employee not be detailed to a job or duties beyond his physical capabilities. Although the proposal was found, <span id="page_691"></span>as usual, to infringe on the right to assign work, whether the proposal was an appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected was a closer question, 27 FLRA at 78:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that this provision is intended to be an arrangement for employees who may be adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights to assign employees and assign work. Based on the Union's undisputed explanation, the provision is intended to protect employees from duties, in new or preexisting positions, which would endanger their health or safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the intended arrangement is appropriate, however, we agree with the Agency's position that the provision's standard for restricting management's rights--whether the duties are within employees' physical capacities--is too broad. The restriction would apply to any duty assignments which employees perceived to be beyond their physical capacities for any reason, and to any extent. In this regard, notwithstanding the Union's stated purpose, the provision excessively interferes with management's right to assign employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was Proposal 1, calling for an increased number of cell phones with GPS capability for correctional officers escorting inmates. The proposal's benefit in enhancing communications in the event of emergencies was outweighed, given existing communications arrangements by the possible compromise of confidentiality of escort teams' movement times and routes. Also nonnegotiable was Proposal 2, calling for provision of additional video equipment to correctional officers escorting or guarding inmates in hospital rooms because the equipment could be used by inmates as a means to escape or harm others. Similarly nonnegotiable, for similar reasons, was Proposal 3, calling for nonlethal weapons to be supplied to escort officers. Negotiable was Proposal 5, that the agency encourage servicing hospitals to have rooms where inmates are housed with doors securable to escort staff. The proposal was designed to ameliorate the increased risk perceived by staff in response to a decision to decrease the number of escort staff carrying firearms. The agency did not show that the process of making a request to hospitals would be a substantial burden. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 506 and DOJ, FCI Coleman</span>, 66 FLRA 929, 932, 935, 937, 940-41 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1904 and VAMC New Orleans</span>, 57 FLRA 28, 29-30 (2001), was a proposal, designed as an arrangement in response to a hospital policy requiring increased monitoring of high risk patients, that those patients be given bracelets that would trigger alarms if the patients left their assigned ward or unit. The impact of the proposal on the hospital's security arrangements was small, the proposal was tailored to the foreseeable effects of the change in hospital policy, and the proposal sought to avoid negative performance appraisals for employees who might otherwise fail to observe the departure of high risk patients from their assigned areas:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">KANG </span>framework to the proposal in this case, it is clear that the proposal constitutes an arrangement for nurses adversely affected by the application of the patient accountability policy to the care of high risk patients in the ACW. In particular, the Union's description of the nursing environment in the ACW is not disputed. Thus, the record indicates patients in this ward are there because they are seriously ill and the care of these patients requires significant time and attention on the part of the nurses. In this regard, although the Agency states that it schedules and assigns nurses consistent with patient care needs, it does not dispute the Union's contention that the ACW is often short staffed. As the Union points out, such staffing only exacerbates patient care demands on the ACW nursing staff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In such a situation, it is reasonable to conclude that nurses in the ACW would not have adequate time to pay attention to high risk patients assigned to their ward. Consequently, the risk of such a patient leaving the ward and the possibility that nurses will not detect their leaving, is increased. As a result, nurses face increased liability under the patient accountability policy. The Agency states that patient accountability is a "performance issue." This, at a minimum, suggests that nurses are vulnerable to lowered performance appraisals based on inadequate attention to patient location.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The increased potential for lowered performance appraisals constitutes an adverse effect within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, </span>45 FLRA 339, 370 (1992). Moreover, it is clear that this increased potential is a result of the application of the patient accountability policy, which constitutes the exercise of a management right, to nurses who have the burden of caring for high risk patients in addition to the demands of caring for the seriously ill patients in the ACW. Thus, because the use of wander guards under the proposal is designed to mitigate against that increased potential for lowered performance appraisals, it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, because the proposal would benefit only nurses in the ACW who have been assigned care of high risk patients, the proposal is sufficiently tailored to constitute an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, </span>47 FLRA 705, 728 (1993) <span class="Italic">(Member Armendariz dissenting in part,</span> <span class="Italic">concurring in part).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question is whether the burden imposed by the proposal outweighs the benefit afforded nurses by the proposal.&#x2003;Stated differently, the question is whether the proposal excessively interferes with management's right so as to not be appropriate under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the use of wander guard bracelets on high risk patients in the ACW would make it easier for nurses to provide the level of care required by those seriously ill patients and monitor the location of high risk patients who are also assigned to the ACW.&#x2003;As a result, those nurses would benefit significantly from the proposal, because they would be less vulnerable to lowered performance appraisals under the Agency's policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the burden on the Agency's internal security policy is slight. The purpose of that policy, insofar as it pertains to patients, is to ensure the safety of those patients. The Agency already uses wander guard bracelets in the TCU for that purpose. Accordingly, rather than burdening the Agency's ability to ensure high risk patient safety, the proposal would enhance that objective by widening use to all high risk patients also assigned to the ACW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the use of wander guard bracelets in the ACW does not preclude the Agency from holding nurses in that ward accountable for monitoring high risk patient location under its policy. In this respect, rather than undermining the policy, the proposal simply make it easier for nurses to comply with that policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the reduced risk of lowered performance appraisals to nurses caring for high risk patients on the ACW, that results from the use of wander guards, against the burden on the Agency's ability to establish and implement its patient accountability policy, it is clear that the benefit afforded nurses under the proposal outweighs the burden of the proposal on management's right to determine its internal security policies. Thus the proposal does not excessively interfere with that right, and is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 506 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman</span>, 66 FLRA 819, 822-24 (2012) (petition for review denied as to Proposal 1, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman v. FLRA</span>, 737 F.3d 779 (D.C. Cir. 2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>)), approved a proposal requiring that prison inmates be precluded from wearing watches that did not clear metal detectors. The purpose of the proposal was to reduce bottlenecks at security checkpoints, a measure that the union successfully argued was an arrangement to address management's decision to use metal detectors:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 1 affects management's right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to determine internal security practices includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 63 FLRA 174, 175-76 (2009). Where an agency shows a link or reasonable connection between its security objective and a policy or practice designed to implement that objective, a proposal that conflicts with the policy or practice affects this management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 176. In deciding whether a proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices, the Authority does not examine the merit of the practices adopted by an agency. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 171, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 64 FLRA 275, 277 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Local 171</span>). Further, a federal correctional facility has special security concerns that may not be present at other work locations. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 142, 145 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Council 33</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, because "[m]anagement's rights under [&#x00A7;] 7106 include not only the right to act, but also the right not to act," management's right to determine internal security practices includes an agency's right "to determine that it will not take action against...specific threats." <span class="Italic">NFFE</span>, 36 FLRA at 632. Under Proposal 1, the Agency would lose the discretion to decide whether the additional physical searches necessitated by prohibited watches warrants forbidding inmates from wearing those watches. Rather, the Agency would be required to confiscate prohibited watches and treat them as contraband. Because Proposal 1 would affect the Agency's decision "not [to] take action against...[the] threat" posed by prohibited watches, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, we find that Proposal 1 affects management's right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 1 is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When considering whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable <span id="page_692"></span>effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 617-18 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991)). However, the Authority has held that proposals "intended to eliminate the possibility of an adverse effect, may constitute appropriate arrangements negotiable under [&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(3)." <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 191 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Chapter 243</span>). In particular, such "prophylactic" proposals will be found sufficiently tailored in situations where it is not possible to draft a proposal targeting only those employees who will be adversely affected by an agency action. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1770</span>, 64 FLRA 953, 959-60 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Local 1770</span>) ("prophylactic" provisions that would eliminate anticipated adverse effects for <span class="Italic">all</span> employees negotiable where agency "failed to establish how the provisions could be tailored more narrowly").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union asserts that the Agency's decision to install the compound detectors has adversely affected officer safety by creating bottlenecks at the entrances of the compound-detector areas. According to the Union, these bottlenecks reduce the effectiveness of the clearing process, increase risks to the safety of the officers, and increase the amount of time officers spend outdoors "at the mercy of...climate conditions." Although the Agency disputes the allegation that officers spend substantially more time outdoors monitoring inmate movements as a result of the installation of the compound detectors, it concedes that the time officers spend conducting these duties has increased at least "slightly" as a result of the change. Moreover, the Agency does not address the other adverse effects alleged by the Union, such as the bottlenecks and the corresponding threats to the safety and effectiveness of the screening procedure at the compound detectors. As a result, the Agency has conceded that these adverse effects flow from the installation of the compound detectors. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(2) (failure to respond to an assertion raised by other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to that assertion). Because Proposal 1 is intended to reduce nuisance alarms triggered by prohibited watches, thereby moving inmates through the compound-detector bottlenecks more quickly, we find that the Union has demonstrated that Proposal 1 ameliorates the adverse effects of the Agency's exercise of its right to determine internal security practices by installing the compound detectors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the proposal is not tailored because it might "benefit...every officer...who has to monitor a metal detector"--not just the officers who work at the compound detectors. But the proposal is "prophylactic" in nature, <span class="Italic">Local 1770</span>, 64 FLRA at 959-60, because it is "intended to eliminate the possibility" of inmates arriving at the compound detectors wearing watches that set off nuisance alarms and impede the screening process, <span class="Italic">Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA at 191, thereby causing the bottlenecks and their corresponding adverse effects on officers at the compound detectors. Accordingly, we find that the Union has demonstrated that Proposal 1 is a sufficiently tailored arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Authority finds a proposal to be an arrangement, then the Authority will determine whether it is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31-33. The Authority has found proposals not to excessively interfere with management's right to determine internal security practices where the agency fails to sufficiently explain the burden the proposal would place on the exercise of that right. <span class="Italic">E.g., NFFE</span>, 36 FLRA at 628; <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2050</span>, 35 FLRA 706, 711-12 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Local 2050</span>). Relatedly, the Authority has found a provision to be an appropriate arrangement where it reflected an existing security practice and the agency failed to explain how maintaining that practice was "burdensome." <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 839-40 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the benefits that Proposal 1 would afford employees, banning prohibited watches would reduce the delays, inefficiencies, and security risks caused by nuisance alarms at the compound-detector bottlenecks. Further, this benefit is consistent with the Agency's internal security objectives, as evidenced by the Agency's screening standards, which encourage a "zero tolerance rule" for nuisance alarms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the burdens on management's right to determine internal security practices, the Agency asserts that the proposal "leaves management no discretion whatsoever to make the internal security decision as to what is and is not contraband as it relates to inmates['] watches." But the Agency does not explain what security objectives it intends to further by allowing inmates to wear, or buy in the commissary, watches that do not clear metal detectors. Further, the proposal does not prohibit the Agency from banning any contraband. The Agency does not explain why Proposal 1--which leaves the Agency's existing contraband policies intact except that it prohibits inmates from wearing an additional type of item that triggers nuisance alarms--is particularly burdensome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency fails to offer any evidence or make any specific arguments explaining how the proposal burdens management's ability to determine internal security practices, we find that the unexplained burden is outweighed by the proposal's benefits to employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. NFFE</span>, 36 FLRA at 628; <span class="Italic">Local 2050</span>, 35 FLRA at 711-12. Therefore, we find that Proposal 1 is an appropriate arrangement for the exercise of management's right to determine internal security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 1 does not affect management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to assign work encompasses the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA 1049, 1050 (2001). According to the Agency, Proposal 1 affects the Agency's right to assign work because it is intended to reduce the amount of time officers spend monitoring inmate movements, and "if management wants compound officers to spend 3.5 hours on the compound each day dealing with inmate movements, it has the statutory right to do so." But nothing in the proposal precludes management from assigning officers to spend 3.5 hours a day dealing with inmate movements, or otherwise affects management's right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, or to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that Proposal 1 affects management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">On review, FLRA's decision on Proposal 1 was sustained in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman v. FLRA</span>, 737 F.3d 779, 785-86 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (following remand, reaffirming negotiability after considering agency's argument as to "changed circumstances," <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 506 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman</span>, 67 FLRA 694 (2014)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We need not tarry long over Proposal 1, for the Authority's decision is eminently reasonable and supported by the record. The Authority found that the Union had identified several adverse effects resulting from BOP's decision to install new outdoor metal detectors. These adverse effects included, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, bottlenecks at the metal detector entrances that compromised the safety of officers and the efficacy of the clearing process and that increased the amount of time officers were "at the mercy of...climate conditions." <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 823. Moreover, the Authority found that "Proposal 1 is sufficiently tailored because it targets a group of employees likely to be harmed by a particular exercise of management's right to determine internal security practices, here, the installation of outdoor metal detectors. It is intended to reduce nuisance alarms triggered by prohibited watches, thereby moving inmates through the compound-detector bottlenecks more quickly." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 823. Finally, the Authority found that Proposal 1 is an "appropriate arrangement" under <span class="Italic">KANG</span> because "banning prohibited watches would reduce the delays, inefficiencies, and security risks caused by nuisance alarms at the compound-detector bottlenecks." <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 823.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During argument before this court, counsel for BOP suggested that Proposal 1 should be declared non-negotiable because BOP retains sole discretion to determine all matters related to internal security at its prisons. This assertion is wrong as a matter of law. As noted above in <span class="Italic">NTEU 2008</span>, "[i]n assessing whether a proposal that would affect an agency's right to determine its internal security practices is nonetheless negotiable as an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the '<span class="Italic">KANG</span> test.'" 550 F.3d at 1150. The Authority appropriately applied the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> test here and reasonably determined that Proposal 1 would not excessively interfere with management rights. BOP argued before the FLRA that Proposal 1 excessively interferes with its management rights because it would leave the agency without discretion to decide "what is and is not contraband as it relates to inmate watches." However, as the FLRA properly notes, BOP never explained to the Authority just how this purported loss of discretion would "excessively interfere" with BOP's management rights. <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 823.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we can find no grounds upon which to overturn the judgment of the Authority with respect to Proposal 1. The Authority's decision clearly passes muster under the applicable standard of review.</p>
<p class="noindent">But FLRA's determination of the negotiability of Proposal 2 was set aside in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman v. FLRA</span>, 737 F.3d 779 (D.C. Cir. 2013). From FLRA's decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 66 FLRA at 824, Proposal 2 was that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A block and mortar Compound Officer's station, or comparable building materials, will be constructed on the compound. This should be constructed near one of the metal detector areas. The Metal Detector Station on the opposite side of the compound should have a secure area to be used as a control center for controlling inmate movement through the metal detector area, enclosed in a chain link fence, or something comparable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal as a whole infringed management's right to determine internal security and it was an inappropriate arrangement, but FLRA severed out the third sentence and concluded that it was negotiable, 66 FLRA at 828:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_693"></span>Here, the Union has explained how the third sentence of Proposal 2 has a separate meaning, and can operate independently, from the first two sentences. In this regard, while the first two sentences of Proposal 2 address the construction of the officers' station, the third sentence addresses creating a "secure area" in the compound-detector area on one side of the compound, and provides that the secure area should be "enclosed in a chain link fence, or something comparable. The Union does not state, and there is no basis for finding, that the "secure area" is necessarily the physical, block-and-mortar officers' station discussed in the first two sentences of the proposal. Accordingly, we grant the Union's request to sever the third sentence of Proposal 2. <span class="Italic">See NATCA</span>, 61 FLRA at 343.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arguing that the severed sentence is outside the duty to bargain, the Agency "specifically incorporates" the arguments that it makes regarding Proposals 3 through 7. As discussed previously, the severed sentence of the proposal uses the word "should," and we have adopted the Union's explanation that the severed sentence does not require that the compound-detector area have a secure area. The Agency does not explain how, absent such a requirement, the sentence is outside the duty to bargain. Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the sentence is outside the duty to bargain, and we find it within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sensing that FLRA's rationale was incomprehensible, the court set aside its negotiability determination, 737 F.3d at 786-88:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision on Proposal 2 is a different matter, however. It is arbitrary and capricious because it is "largely incomprehensible" and thus not supported by reasoned decisionmaking. <span class="Italic">Coburn</span>, 679 F.3d at 926.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority held that the Proposal 2 <span class="Italic">taken as a whole</span> was non-negotiable because "a proposal concerning the construction of a shelter for officers on the grounds of a correctional facility affects management's right to determine internal security practices." <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 826. The Authority found that "management has made a decision to keep the compound area free from any obstructions that could aid an inmate in escaping, committing an assault, or otherwise engaging in illegal or non-allowed conduct in that area." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 825. (citation and alterations omitted). Thus, the Authority concluded that Proposal 2 would impermissibly infringe management rights, and it further concluded that the proposal was not an appropriate arrangement because it "excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 826.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Oddly, however, the Authority concluded that the third sentence in Proposal 2--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Metal Detector Station on the opposite side of the compound should have a secure area to be used as a control center for controlling inmate movement through the metal detector area, enclosed in a chain link fence, or something comparable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">--is negotiable because it "has a separate meaning, and can operate independently, from the first two sentences." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 828. Given the words of the proposal and the Authority's holding with regard to Proposal 2 in its entirely, this conclusion makes no sense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an effort to defend its conclusion, the Authority found that the first two sentences of Proposal 2 "address the construction of the officers' station, [while] the third sentence addresses creating a 'secure area' in the compound-detector area...[and not] necessarily the physical, block-and-mortar officers' station discussed in the first two sentences of the proposal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Most notably, the Authority held that "the severed sentence of the proposal uses the word <span class="Italic">'should'</span> and we have adopted the Union's explanation that the severed sentence does not require that the compound detector area have a secure area." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Thus, the Authority's decision relies heavily on its view that the word "should" commands nothing and that, therefore, the third sentence has no substantive content.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its brief to this court, the FLRA amplified its view of the third sentence of Proposal 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Authority found that the [third sentence in Proposal 2] is within the duty to bargain because it "does not require that the compound-detector area have a secure area," <span class="Italic">only that it should have such an area</span>. In other words, the Authority determined that the proposal's use of the non-obligatory term "should" does not affect any management right.... The Agency's claim must fail because the Agency did not, and cannot, explain how a proposal that does not require it to do anything could be outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When pressed at oral argument on this point, counsel for the Authority repeated the claim that the third sentence in Proposal 2 requires nothing of BOP. He also asserted that, even if it were included in a collective bargaining agreement, the Union's proposal would have no meaning and could not be enforced. According to counsel, BOP was thus obliged to bargain over the third sentence of Proposal 2. This is a specious line of reasoning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority rhetorically asks: how can "a proposal that does not require [BOP] to do anything" be outside the duty to bargain? <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is the wrong question. The proper question here is: how can a proposal that purports to have no meaning whatsoever be within the scope of the statutory duty to bargain? The Authority has provided no answer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's claim that the disputed proposal is meaningless is sophistry. On its face, the third sentence in Proposal 2 plainly would require a secure area for use as a control center; that is what the Union was seeking. And the Authority concedes that such a proposal would not be negotiable. The Authority's claim that the word "should" in the third sentence somehow negates the force of what is being proposed does not withstand scrutiny. "Should" is typically used to express an obligation or duty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="small-d">WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY</span> 2104 (3d ed. 1976). Thus, the disputed proposal presented by the Union certainly suggests something more than nothing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, counsel for the Authority acknowledged that if BOP was required to bargain over the third sentence in Proposal 2 and the parties failed to reach agreement, the dispute could be submitted to the Federal Services Impasses Panel for resolution. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(b). The Impasses Panel may use any of a number of dispute resolution techniques--such as informal conferences, additional mediation, fact finding, written submissions, recommendations for settlement, and mediation-arbitration--to resolve a bargaining impasse. If the parties are still unable to reach settlement, the Impasses Panel may impose contract terms upon the parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7119(c); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2471.1, 2471.6. Both this court and the Authority have held that, barring "unusual circumstances," Panel decisions are not reviewable by the Authority or a court. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d 1497, 1499, 237 U.S. App. D.C. 61 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (holding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(1) "commits to the [impasses] panel broad authority to make swift decisions in order to end disputes," and that such decisions are normally binding and nonreviewable); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 63 F.L.R.A. 183 (2009) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>), (same). In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority tellingly stated that, in matters concerning the resolution by an Impasses Panel of a negotiation impasse under the statutory authority of &#x00A7; 7119(c)(1),</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[the statute]&#x2003;establishes the Panel as an independent entity within the Authority and commits to the Panel the broad authority to make decisions to resolve negotiation impasses. <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d at 1499. That broad authority denies direct review of Panel orders by either the Authority or the courts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1499-1500.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">63 F.L.R.A. at 187.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the wording of the Union's proposal, an Impasses Panel seemingly would be free to impose a contract term that requires BOP to construct a secure area for controlling inmate movement through the metal detector area, enclosed in a chain link fence, or something comparable. This would be quite ironic, because the Authority suggests that BOP has no obligation to bargain over such a requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The point here is that the Authority's decision that the third sentence in Proposal 2 is negotiable could result in its imposition on the parties by an Impasses Panel. It is possible, of course, that BOP could fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures or decline to adhere to a contract provision imposed by an Impasses Panel requiring it to construct the secure area. This might prompt the Union to file an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(6), which would allow the Authority to clarify its position on the meaning of the third sentence in Proposal 2. <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d at 1500 (noting that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency or a labor organization "to fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions"). But the Authority has not argued here that if an Impasses Panel imposes a contract term that requires BOP to construct a secure area to be used as a control center for controlling inmate movement through the metal detector area, enclosed in a chain link fence, or something comparable, this would be subject to review by the Authority. Therefore, we decline to address this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Authority's construction of the third sentence in Proposal 2 defies reasoned decisionmaking. We therefore hold that the Authority's decision regarding the third sentence of Proposal 2 is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
