<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-278"><span class="space">r.</span> Enforced and Administrative Leave; Facility Shutdown; 2016 Administrative Leave Act</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo and IFPTE, Local 5</span>, 48 FLRA 1372, 1377-78 (1994), sustained an award that enforced a contract provision restricting compulsory use of annual leave when agency operations are suspended. The award required the agency to fully compensate employees who were required to use annual leave during a temporary plant shutdown:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's contention that the award conflicts with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.302 because it requires the Agency to grant employees administrative leave for the 4-day period of the shutdown. In this connection, regulations permitting the employees involved in this case to be released from work without charge to leave or loss of pay are set out at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 610.301-610.306. As relevant here, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.302 states that agencies may grant administrative leave "to the extent warranted by good administration for short periods of time not generally exceeding 3 consecutive workdays...." In our view, the use of the word "generally" provides discretion to the agency to determine the actual duration of the administrative leave to be granted if "warranted by good administration," so long as the period of time for which such administrative leave is granted is "short." The Agency has not demonstrated that the time period involved in this case, 4 workdays, is not reasonably within the ambit of the language of the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, California and International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 174, AFL-CIO and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2237, AFL-CIO and Federal Employees Metal Trades Council, Long Beach, California</span>, 7 FLRA 362, 367-68 (1981) (<span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>) (similarly interpreting identical language then set out in FPM Supplement 990-2, Book 610, subchapter S3-2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency has not demonstrated that the portions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.302 providing that administrative leave "may not be used" for situations that "ordinarily would be covered by the scheduling of leave, furlough or the assignment of other work[,]" precludes the Agency from placing employees on administrative leave for the period of the 4-day shutdown. In this regard, we note that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.305 provides that administrative leave may be granted in a number of such circumstances, including situations where agencies or portions thereof are closed for short periods. As the Agency retains discretion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 610.301-610.306 to determine whether and how much administrative leave may be granted during a period of a shut down, the Agency has not established that the award is contrary to these regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2608 and SSA, San Juan</span>, 56 FLRA 776, 778 (2000), upheld an award directing the agency to honor a contract provision that required the agency to grant employees excused absences (administrative leave) when the agency closed its workplace due to an emergency. As to employees who worked during the emergency closing, an award of compensatory time in the form of credit hours was set aside:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Compensatory time is a substitute for overtime pay.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5543.[3] There is no finding that the employees worked overtime or were otherwise entitled to overtime pay. As a result, there is no basis for concluding that the employees are entitled to receive compensatory time under chapter 55 of title 5, and the award is deficient in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2240"></span>In addition, the Agency correctly asserts that employees may receive credit hours only pursuant to an established credit hours program pursuant to chapter 61 of title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6121 and 6122.[4] There is no evidence that the award was made pursuant to a credit hours program for the aggrieved employees. As a result, there is no basis for concluding that the employees are entitled to receive credit hours under chapter 61 of title 5, and the award is deficient in this regard also.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we conclude that the remedy is contrary to chapters 55 and 61 of title 5. In cases where the Authority sets aside an entire remedy, but upholds an arbitrator's finding of an underlying violation, the Authority remands the award to determine whether a different remedy would be appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of Defense, Departments of the Army and the Air Force, Alabama National Guard, Northport, Alabama and Alabama Association of Civilian Technicians</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 41-42 (1998); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Orlando, Florida and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3627</span>, 54 FLRA 609, 614 (1998).

<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">NTEU and EPA</span>, 72 FLRA 537, 537–39 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring), determined that the 2016 Administrative Leave Act superceded and conflicted with a provision of the parties' agreement granting administrative leave during some weather emergencies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 54, Section 6(D) of the parties' agreement (Article 54) provides that "[w]hen severe weather or other circumstances prevent work from [an approved telework site] (e.g., electricity, employee must evacuate, infrastructure/connectivity and child/elder care issues)...and the office is closed to employees, a telework-ready employee may be granted administrative leave." Before 2018, the Agency--applying Article 54--regularly granted administrative leave to telework-approved employees when severe weather closed both the Agency office and the employees' child-care facilities. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">In December 2016, Congress passed the Act, which divided administrative leave into four distinct categories of paid leave: (1) administrative leave, (2) investigative leave, (3) notice leave, and (4) weather-and-safety leave. Regarding weather-and-safety leave, &#x00A7; 6329c of the Act provides that an agency may approve such leave "only if the employee...is prevented from safely traveling to or performing work at an approved location."[5] In April 2018, OPM issued 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1603 (&#x00A7; 630), a regulation implementing the weather-and-safety-leave provision of the Act.[6] In relevant part, &#x00A7; 630 states that "an agency may grant weather[-]and[-]safety leave to employees only if they are prevented from safely traveling to or safely performing work at a location approved by the agency."[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6329c(b).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A month later, on May 29, 2018, the Agency informed the Union that under the new OPM regulation, employees would "generally not be granted weather[-]and[-]safety leave (previously administrative leave)" when they are able to safely work from their approved telework location (the new policy). The Agency also noted that the new policy would apply regardless of requirements in the parties' agreement. Subsequently, several employees requested administrative leave under Article 54 when their children's care facilities closed due to severe weather. In denying these requests, Agency officials explained to employees that the new OPM regulation prohibited weather-and-safety leave for child care.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance alleging that the Act did not prohibit the Agency from granting administrative leave for child care. Because Article 54 was already in effect when the Agency implemented &#x00A7; 630, the Union also alleged that the Agency's implementation of &#x00A7; 630 violated Article 2, Section 2 of the parties' agreement,[11] &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) of the Statute, and OPM's supplemental commentary instructing agencies on how to implement &#x00A7; 630.[12] The grievance proceeded to arbitration, and the Arbitrator framed the issues as "[w]hether [the Agency] violated applicable provisions of the [parties' agreement], statutory law and accompanying regulations in implementing...[&#x00A7;] 630...[and] if so, what is the appropriate remedy?"[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;CBA at 3 ("Any rule or regulation published after the effective date of this [a]greement...will not be enforced for bargaining[-]unit employees...if it conflicts with the specific terms of the [a]greement.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;Weather and Safety Leave, 83 Fed. Reg. 15,291 (Apr. 10, 2018) ("For an agency collective[-]bargaining agreement in effect before publication of these regulations, any provision in the regulations (other than those restating statutory requirements) that are in conflict with the agreement may not be enforced until the expiration of the current term of the agreement.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator observed that "weather[-]and[-]safety leave is a new type of leave previously granted as administrative leave." Reasoning that Article 54 concerned administrative leave for weather and safety reasons, the Arbitrator found that Article 54 addresses the same circumstances as &#x00A7; 6329c of the Act. As Article 54 permits weather-and-safety leave in scenarios that the Act and OPM regulations do not--such as when severe weather causes child-care-facility closures--the Arbitrator concluded that &#x00A7; 6329c of the Act and &#x00A7; 630 of OPM's regulations conflicted with, and superseded, Article 54. Consequently, he denied the Union's grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator failed to identify any wording in &#x00A7; 6329c that prohibits the Agency from granting leave when child-care facilities are closed due to severe weather. Additionally, the Union contends that the award is contrary to OPM's supplemental commentary, which states that "any provision in the regulations (other than those restating statutory requirements) that are in conflict with [a preexisting] agreement may not be enforced until the expiration of the current term of the agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By its plain terms, &#x00A7; 6329c permits weather-and-safety leave "only" when an employee is prevented from safely performing work at an approved location.[17] Article 54 of the parties' agreement conflicts with &#x00A7; 6329c because Article 54 permits weather-and-safety leave when telework-ready employees' child-care facilities are closed--even if those employees could safely work from an approved location.[18] Moreover, nothing in the wording of &#x00A7; 6329c requires--or even permits--the Agency to grant weather-and-safety leave for child care.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding OPM's supplemental commentary, its guidance on implementation of regulations that conflict with preexisting agreements makes an exception for regulations that "restat[e] statutory requirements"[20] Section 630 of OPM's regulations effectively restates the Act's requirements by limiting weather-and-safety leave to circumstances where employees cannot safely work.[21] Thus, just as the wording of &#x00A7; 6329c allows the Agency to grant weather-and-safety leave <span class="Italic">only</span> when employees are prevented from safely working at an approved location, so, too, does &#x00A7; 630. Consequently, the Union fails to establish that the award is contrary to either &#x00A7; 6329c of the Act or OPM's commentary on implementing &#x00A7; 630, and we deny these exceptions.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also contends that the award is contrary to the Statute and fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement because the Agency cited the regulation--rather than the Act--in implementing the new policy. However, where a provision of a collective-bargaining agreement is contrary to law, an agency's failure to comply with that provision does not constitute a repudiation.[24] Here, as discussed above, the Agency appropriately implemented the new policy consistent with the Act, and the OPM regulation effectively mirrors the Act. Thus, although the Agency cited the regulation in implementing the new policy, Article 54 was unenforceable because it conflicted with, and was superseded by, the Act. Consequently, the Union's remaining contrary-to-law and essence exceptions have no merit, and we deny them.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent">An award directing a remedy for employees placed on enforced leave in violation of a negotiated agreement was sustained, except that FLRA limited the award to individuals who demonstrably would not have been placed on leave status but for the agency's violation of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">FEMTC Local 831 and Dept. of Navy, Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>, 39 FLRA 1456, 1459 (1991).

<p class="noindent">An award was upheld that precluded the agency from preventing a contract grant of occasional administrative leave at the end of shifts of air traffic controllers when there were no air traffic control operations to be performed. Rejecting the argument that the award created an unlawful workweek of less than 40 hours, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB and Sport Air Traffic Controllers Org.</span>, 65 FLRA 387, 388-89 (2010), concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(2)(A), the head of each agency is directed to establish a "basic administrative workweek of 40 hours for each full-time employee in [the] organization[.]" The Agency does not demonstrate that the award is contrary to this obligation. In this connection, although the Agency asserts that the award effectively allows employees to work a thirty-seven-hour workweek, the Union disputes this assertion, and the Arbitrator made no finding that the parties' current practice allows such a situation. There is no basis for the Authority to make a factual finding, not present in the award, that either the parties' current practice or the Arbitrator's award allows a thirty-seven-hour workweek on a regular basis. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n</span>, 65 FLRA 79, 85 (2010) (Authority declined to make disputed factual finding not present in arbitrator's award). Thus, there is no basis for finding that the award requires the Agency to establish a thirty-seven-hour workweek.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award simply enforces the Agency's agreement to permit supervisors broad discretion to approve administrative leave. In this regard, the Authority has recognized that agencies have broad discretion to grant administrative leave to employees for brief, occasional or sporadic periods of time when warranted by specific circumstances which are not a part of the daily routine of work. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 58 FLRA 630, 633 (2003) (administrative leave before Christmas holiday); <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 25 FLRA at 603 ("essence of such leave is that it is only occasional or sporadic--when warranted by specific circumstances which are not a part of the daily routine of work"); <span class="Italic">NLRB, Region 5</span>, 2 FLRA 327, 329-31 (1979) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>) (administrative leave to cover tardiness in reporting to work); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 439th Airlift Wing, Westover Air Reserve Base, Mass.</span>, 55 FLRA 945, 949 (1999) (administrative leave for time spent engaging in mandatory crew rest periods after long distance flights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award in this case is consistent with this Authority case law.&#x2003;As the Arbitrator noted, supervisory discretion to grant such leave is limited to fifty-nine minute increments. Therefore, the leave is granted for brief periods only. As the Arbitrator also found, the supervisory discretion to grant this leave is limited to situations where "operations permit," which means where the grievants have no duties to perform because no air traffic operations are required. Therefore, the leave is be granted on an occasional or a sporadic rather than a routine basis because whether employees have duties to perform varies depending on mission needs and operational requirements. <span class="Italic">See also AFGE</span>, 25 FLRA at 603. Because the leave at issue here is brief and not granted on a routine basis, it does not unlawfully reduce the grievants' workweek to less than forty hours per week.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circumstances in this case are distinguishable from the circumstances in cases the Agency relies on, <span class="Italic">supra </span>Part III, where agencies were found to have no authority to grant administrative leave. In those cases, the Authority held that paid leave granted to cover employees' routine meal periods cannot count towards the forty-hour workweek. In both cases, the administrative leave was granted on a "regular, daily basis." <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>25 FLRA at 603. Here, in contrast, the award does not require the Agency to regularly grant administrative leave at the end of the grievants' shifts. As discussed above, such leave is limited to brief, occasional periods when "operations permit." Therefore, the Agency has not demonstrated that its authority to grant administrative leave does not properly extend to the type of circumstance involved in this case. For these reasons, the award is consistent with &#x00A7; 6101(a)(2)(A) because it does not reduce employees' workweek to less than forty hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that permitting supervisors to grant up to fifty-nine minutes of paid leave would establish a precedent in future CBAs eliminating any limits on the amount of administrative leave supervisors could grant. However, this decision does not alter controlling Authority precedent that agency discretion is limited only to granting brief, occasional or sporadic periods of administrative leave.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Agency also excepts to the award on the basis that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA renders the CBA "illegal" and "void in its entirety" because it allows first-line supervisors "unfettered authority" to grant paid absences. We construe this as a contention that the award is contrary to law. However, this exception relies on the premise that the grievants' workweek has been unlawfully reduced to less than forty hours a week. As explained above, we reject this premise. Therefore, because the award does not unlawfully reduce the grievants' workweek, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA is not "illegal" and the award cannot be found to be contrary to law on this basis. Accordingly, we deny this exception. In addition, the Agency asserts for the first time in its exceptions that the award is contrary to management rights because "as interpreted, the provision determines which manager performs a given task[.]" There is no indication in the record that the Agency presented this argument to the Arbitrator. Because the issue was not presented to the Arbitrator, it is not properly before the Authority under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. U.S. Dep't of the Army, The Adjutant General, Mo. Nat'l Guard, Bridgeton, Mo.</span>, 56 FLRA 1104, 1106 (2001). For these reasons, we dismiss this exception....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator's award unlawfully reduced the grievants' workweek to less than forty hours. Therefore, the Agency's exception provides no basis for finding that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(2)(A). Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 58 FLRA 630, 633-34 (2003), sustained an award of administrative leave to some employees for the day before the Christmas holiday. The award did not establish a tour of duty, it was not contrary to 5 CFR 610.102 (defining a tour of duty), and the award was consistent with the authority of agencies to grant administrative leave for short periods of time. <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 3917</span>, 64 FLRA 651 (2010), affirmed an award involving a contract clause providing for administrative leave for volunteer activities consistent with the agency's mission, including a Community Development Block Grant Program.<span class="Italic"> Dept. of Air Force, Westover ARB and AFGE Local 3707</span>, 55 FLRA 945, 949 (1999), approved an award of "constructive credit" of working hours for air reserve technicians who were required to take rest periods while participating in long distance flights.
