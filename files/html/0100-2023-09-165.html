<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-163"><span class="space">e.</span> Last Chance Agreement Superseded by Independent Adverse Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">To be effective as a bar to litigation, an agency must ensure that the LCA clearly recites a triggering action, that the agreement contains a clear waiver of appeal rights should the action occur, and that the underlying action and associated penalty be relied on (or be reactivated) by the agency should the LCA be violated by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Alexander v. USPS</span>, 264 F.3d 1067, 1068-71 (Fed. Cir. 2001), determined that the agency essentially ignored its LCA and could not rely on the appellant's waiver of appeal rights when the agency instituted an entirely new adverse action against the appellant (while the agency could have relied upon the agreement it earlier negotiated):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 29, 1997, the United States Postal Service proposed to remove Alexander as a mail handler for "IMPROPER CONDUCT/THREATENING A POSTAL MANAGER." The notice alleged that in August 1997 Alexander, after a "verbal argument" with his supervisor, was told repeatedly to go home, but refused to leave; that he became "enraged and started screaming"; that subsequently, he "moved quickly and aggressively towards [his supervisor] throwing [his]left shoulder forward and attempting to slam [his]shoulder into [his supervisor's] right shoulder"; and that he had to be escorted from the area by the town police.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The matter was settled on June 11, 1998 by a "Last Chance Agreement" between Alexander and the Postal Service. The agreement stated that "in reference to the removal notice dated 9/29/97, proposing to remove you from the U.S. Postal Service," the agency would hold "the subject removal...in abeyance for a period of two (2) years" to give Alexander "a Last Chance Opportunity to demonstrate his/her dependability, reliability and suitability for employment." Alexander agreed that he would "meet all terms and conditions listed in this agreement" for two years, that "[i]f for any reason you are found incapable of safely performing the duties of your position, no further consideration under this agreement will be granted and your removal will be effected," and that "future performance deficiencies, including, but not limited to, attendance, or failing to perform his/her assigned duties will also be grounds for removal." Paragraph 14 of the Agreement provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is agreed by all parties to this agreement that any violations of the terms or conditions of this agreement by the grievant will result in the removal being effected. In the event that the 9/29/97 removal is effected, grievant agrees <span id="Page_1136"></span>to forego any appeal of the removal action in any forum including grievance/arbitration, (MSPB) merit system protection board [sic], or under EEO complaint processing procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sixteen months later, on October 20, 1999, the Postal Service again proposed to remove Alexander, this time for "VIOLATION OF LAST CHANCE AGREEMENT [sic]FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LAST CHANCE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY YOU ON June 11, 1998/FAILURE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS." The notice alleged that on October 4, 1999, Alexander "engaged in a verbal altercation with [another]employee [and]would not comply with [his supervisor's] repeated instructions to return to duty," and that Alexander's "failure to follow instructs [sic]resulted in your not completing the remainder of your work assignment on October 4, 1999."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering Alexander's response, the Postal Service removed him on December 8, 1999. It ruled that "the charges as stated in the notice dated October 20, 1999 are fully supported by the evidence and warrants your removal." It told Alexander that "[a]s a preference eligible, you have a right to appeal this decision in writing to the Merit Systems Protection Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alexander appealed his removal to the Board. After an evidentiary hearing, the Board's administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing Alexander's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which became final when the Board refused to review it<span class="Italic">. Alexander v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, No. PH-0752-00-0129-1-1 (Merit Sys. Prot. Bd. May 3, 2000) ("Initial Decision"). The Board found that "[t]he agency demonstrated that [Alexander]failed to follow [his supervisor's] instructions and therefore breached the [last chance] agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6. The Board further found that "the instructions in question [to return to work] were those that Mr. Williams, as the appellant's supervisor, was entitled to give and have obeyed, notwithstanding the attendant circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8. Finally, the Board ruled that in the Agreement Alexander waived his right to appeal his removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board erred...in ruling that in the Agreement Alexander waived the right to appeal to the Board his removal for violating the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agreement stated that it related to "the removal notice dated 9/29/97, proposing to remove you" for threatening a postal manager. The "subject removal" that under the Agreement would be held in abeyance for two years was the removal proposed in the September 1997 notice. Paragraph 14 of the Agreement, which contained the waiver of appeal rights, began by stating that any violation by Alexander of the Agreement "will result in the removal being effected." Once again, the "removal" to be effected was that proposed in the prior notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next sentence of paragraph 14 stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the event that the 9/29/97 removal is effected, grievant agrees to forego any appeal of the removal action in any forum including grievance/arbitration, (MSPB) merit system protection board [sic], or under EEO complaint processing procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That provision unambiguously and explicitly waived the right of appeal in one circumstance: if "the 9/29/97 removal is effected," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, if Alexander were removed for the reason stated in that notice of proposed removal--for having threatened a postal supervisor in August 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That was not the basis upon which the Postal Service removed Alexander on December 8, 1999. That removal was explicitly stated to be for violation of the Agreement by disobeying his supervisor's order to return to work on October 4, 1999. Nothing in the October 1999 notice of proposed removal or in the December 1999 removal notice indicates, or even suggests, that the Postal Service's action was "effect[ing]" "the 9/29/97 removal"--the only matter for which Alexander waived his right to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further evidence that the appeal waiver in the Agreement did not cover Alexander's present removal is the statement in the notice of removal that "[a]s a preference eligible, you have a right to appeal this decision in writing to the Merit Systems Protection Board." The notice also gave Alexander information concerning such an appeal. There would be no reason for those statements if Alexander previously had waived his right to appeal his removal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The limited nature of the waiver of Alexander's appeal rights sharply contrasts with the broad waiver at issue in <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1988), where a last chance settlement agreement provided: "[a]ppeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, Grievance-Arbitration and Equal Employment Opportunity complaint procedures are waived during this 1 year probationary period on any disciplinary action against Mr. McCall." The day after signing that agreement, the employee signed a further statement in which he stated: "I know and understand that I have appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board with respect to appealing a removal action against me. By this agreement...I...of my own free will waive my rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board...for the period of my 1 year probation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the oral argument before us, the government contended that by removing Alexander for violating the Agreement, the Postal Service "effected" the earlier 1997 proposed removal. As previously discussed, the fatal flaw in that argument is that the Postal Service removed Alexander for disobeying his superior's order on October 4, 1999 to return to work (thereby violating the Agreement), and not for his threats to a postal manager in 1997, on which the earlier proposed removal was based.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board is affirmed insofar as it determined that Alexander disobeyed the orders of his supervisor to return to work on October 4, 1999. The decision is reversed insofar as it held that in the Last Chance Agreement Alexander, waived the right to appeal his 1999 removal to the Board and that the Board therefore had no jurisdiction over his appeal. The case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings relating to the merits of Alexander's challenge to his removal consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A similar situation arose in <span class="Italic">Fiori v. USPS</span>, 104 MSPR 278, 281-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2006 MSPB 355 (2006), when the LCA permitted the agency to reissue the original removal and the appellant agreed to waive an appeal, but the agency then issued a new removal based on the appellant's violation of the agreement, with the result that the Board had jurisdiction over the ensuing appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may waive the right to appeal a disciplinary action to the Board in a last-chance settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Buchanan v. Department of Energy</span>, 247 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Gibson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 160 F.3d 722, 725 (Fed. Cir. 1998)); <span class="Italic">see also McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of Defense</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 653, 656 (1996). However, the Board has found that it has jurisdiction over an appeal where an agency has effected a new and different action that was not subject to the waiver. <span class="Italic">See Moody v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 319, &#x00B6; 11 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant's argument on PFR that the agency effected a new removal action, and that it is therefore not subject to the LCA's waiver provision. The appellant's prior removal was proposed based on improper conduct for consuming alcohol while on duty on May 5, 2004. This removal was held in abeyance under the terms of the LCA, which also provided that, should the appellant breach the LCA, the former removal action would be reissued. The LCA concludes with the appellant's acknowledgement that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">should I fail to follow the provisions of this settlement, either singly or collectively...this removal notice shall be reissued. I understand that, if the removal is reissued, my termination will be immediate upon receipt of this removal notice. I understand that if the removal action is reissued as a result of any material breach of the settlement, I waive any and all rights to appeal the removal action in any forum....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Based on the foregoing language, the removal to be effected after a breach of the LCA was the prior removal for consuming alcohol on May 5, 2004, and the waiver would apply only to that removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, nothing in the proposed removal notice, or the notice of removal, indicated that the agency was effecting the prior removal, the only removal to which the appellant's waiver would apply. Instead, the agency proposed and effected a new removal action against the appellant for breaching the LCA because she tested positive for alcohol on August 4, 2005. The agency informed the appellant of her right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There would be no need to inform the appellant of her Board appeal rights if she had waived them. Because the agency issued a new removal action based on the appellant's breach of the LCA, rather than reissuing the prior removal, the waiver in the LCA does not bar Board jurisdiction over the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 264 F.3d 1067, 1070-71 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Alexander</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Moody v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 319, 322 &#x00B6; 11 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the last-chance agreement expired, the agency proposed and effected the appellant's removal for falsely requesting sick leave. The agency, however, did not state that it was effecting the appellant's removal based upon the last-chance settlement and instead only noted the last-chance agreement in considering both the appellant's excuse for his conduct and his prior disciplinary record. Further, the agency informed the appellant of his right to file an appeal of this action with the Board. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">Alexander</span>, the appellant waived only his right to appeal the re-issuance of the action held in abeyance in the last-chance agreement, and the agency did not reissue that action. Instead, it effected a new and different action that was not subject to the waiver. The last-chance agreement, therefore, does not bar Board jurisdiction over the appellant's removal.</p>
