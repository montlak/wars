<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-170a"><span class="space">c.</span> Intervening Abolition of Position</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the original position no longer exists after the reinstatement order, a permanent position must be created at the same level of pay, duties, and grade as the original job. The agency cannot shuffle the employee from one temporary job to another. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 24 MSPR 550, 553 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf. Tripodi v. DOJ</span>, 26 MSPR 458, 462 (1985) (a pre-Reform Act case: "[A]?t the time of its abolishment, there was no outstanding Board order requiring appellant's reinstatement...the position would have been abolished even if appellant had still occupied it"; appeal remanded for a determination of whether agency would have been required to use RIF procedures or whether it could have used reassignment to deal with abolition of the position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Abolition of a position should be made known by an agency to the Board if the agency is in a position to supply that information during the portion of an appeal leading up to a corrective action order. The agency, having cooperated in the abolition of a job, and not being in a position to restore the job, must make an effort to find an analogous job, if one exists. <span class="Italic">Wainwright v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 01-3295), explained in a whistleblower reprisal appeal that resulted in a reinstatement order incapable of fulfillment because the appellant's job had, by operation of law, been transferred to an external entity not under the agency's control:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is incorrect for the Board, as a matter of law, to relieve the agency of its <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> duties, merely because the agency has cooperated in the abolition of Ms. Wainwright's former positions. The agency must attempt to return Ms. Wainwright to some job that reasonably approximates the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. What and where that job might be are not for this court to determine. The corrective order in this case is legally flawed. The promise of restoration to the previous position of Associate Director is illusory. The Board, perhaps unaware of the transfer by the agency of all of its power over the Viral Hepatitis Program, has excused the agency of any responsibility to seek a return to a situation approximating the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. This it cannot do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5020"></span>The fact that the agency cannot deliver a particular job does not relieve it of its duty to provide an analogous one, if one exists. Although the Board and the agency apparently do not work together to fashion corrective orders, the agency should at least alert the Board to the likelihood that a particular corrective order may have little, if any, possibility of fruition. This did not occur in this case. Compliance with a legally flawed corrective order is hardly satisfactory relief for a violation of the WPA. Absent a showing by the agency that there is <span class="Italic">no</span> currently available job in its control that it can offer to Ms. Wainwright, the agency must be held to be in noncompliance with its duties under <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency claims that a job has been abolished, making reinstatement to the job impossible, the agency must prove that the job was truly abolished. One appeal found the Board disregarding the agency's representations concerning a job when the agency only introduced two position descriptions for two different positions. Neither description indicated that a job had been abolished. The second description did not show that it had been classified, approved by agency management, or substituted for appellant's former position. The Board also commented, <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, that, even if the job had been abolished, the agency would still have to adhere to a settlement agreement calling for the appellant to be placed into a particular position. <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Dept. of Army</span>, 51 MSPR 601, 606 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Marion v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 443, 445 (1998) ("[a]ppellant has not disputed the administrative judge's finding that his former position no longer exists or contended that someone else is assigned to it.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept. of Transp</span>., <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211216171">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), sustained an arbitrator's determination that the position assigned to the grievant following her reinstatement was appropriate although it did not duplicate the duties of the position she held when she was first taken out of the job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have explained that when an agency is directed to comply with an initial decision reinstating the employee, the purpose of the reinstatement is to place the employee "as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante." Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). "[A]ppropriate steps to enforce compliance must include more than the formal determination that an individual was reinstated to a position bearing the same title, grade, and pay." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The steps must also include a "substantive assessment" of the actual duties and responsibilities to which the employee returned to ensure they are either "the same as or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities...held prior to the wrongful discharge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We have recognized that "in some cases appointment to the position at issue may not be possible because the particular position may have substantially changed or may no longer exist." <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Hum. Servs</span>., 587 F.3d 1310, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2009). In instances where the previous position no longer exists, as is the case here, the agency must restore the employee as nearly as possible to the previously existing position given restoration would be impossible. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, substantial evidence demonstrates that Ms. Reid's position was no longer available. Consistent with precedent, the FTA was obligated to restore her to a position as close as possible to her prior position. The FTA proposed an Economist position in the TSO, and the arbitrator found the position similar in duties and responsibilities to her prior position. The arbitrator correctly performed the requisite substantive assessment, comparing the duties of the TBP Economist position with that of the proposed new TSO Economist position to conclude that the proposed TSO Economist position was consistent with the initial award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator clarified that the initial award required Ms. Reid to be placed in a position with her former job description "to ensure that [Ms. Reid] was not only placed in an Economist position but also was assigned the duties and responsibilities commensurate with the [GS-13] Economist position that she previously held." The arbitrator then explained that the TSO Economist job "would require economic expertise in the transportation industry" and that the position was "clearly an Economist job requiring an economist's skills." We see no error in the arbitrator's assessment that the two positions are substantially equivalent and commensurate with Ms. Reid's skills and experience, and that appointment to the proposed TSO Economist position would be as close as possible to her prior TBP Economist position. This is so even though Ms. Reid's prior position focused on lending and financing policies, whereas the TSO position would focus on economic analysis of the FTA's oversight activities. Because we conclude that the FTA was not required to reinstate Ms. Reid to her exact same prior position to comply with the arbitrator's award--particularly where, as here, her exact same prior position no longer exists--and because Ms. Reid was offered a position the arbitrator found to be substantially equivalent to her prior position, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 88 MSPR 260, 264 &#x00B6; 10 (2001), involving an intervening RIF the Board compared the old and new jobs and found the agency in compliance: "[i]t appears that the range of duties and work assignments that the appellant can expect in his new position are similar, though not precisely the same, as his former responsibilities and assignments." The appellant did not suggest that any of the positions listed as existing or vacant at the time of the abolishment of his former position would be more suitable. <span class="Italic">Carson</span> added as to a training requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Further, the requirement of additional training for the FR position does not, without more, require a finding that the appellant's assignment to this position is improper. Certainly if the assignment were to change the appellant's tenure so that he would be viewed as a probationer, the assignment would not establish compliance with the Board's February 3, 2000 order. We do not, however, view the training period described by the agency here as equivalent to a probationary period. We expect the agency to make every effort to assist the appellant in completing the training and reject, as speculative, the appellant's assertion that the training program will provide the agency with a pretext for reprisal.[7] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (there is a presumption that public officials perform their duties in good faith).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Given the cost of the training it is in the agency's interest to ensure that the appellant successfully completes it. Additionally, the leader of the FR Group states that to his knowledge all of the individuals who have entered the FR training program have successfully completed it. The appellant is well aware of his appeal rights in any event.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a reassignment resulting from an intervening reorganization, the agency's action was unobjectionable when applied to an individual who prevailed in a RIF appeal, <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 65 MSPR 447, 451 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the reassignment of the appellant was valid since it was part of an agency reorganization necessitated by budget and manpower reductions. Further, since the agency announced its intent to reorganize on August 6, 1993, prior to the Board's decision on appellant's RIF action, there is no indication that the reorganization was done to circumvent compliance. Under <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, the employee must be placed <span class="Italic">as nearly as possible</span> in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. The new position evolved from appellant's former position and the agency has shown that it is a similar position. The grade level and pay, the level of work supervised, the scope and effect of the program supervised, and the degree of contact with other federal employees and agencies are in all respects the same. Given the circumstances of this case and the agency's assertion that the appellant's former position was abolished by reorganization, the Board finds no record basis for finding the agency in noncompliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Higashi v. Department of the Army</span>, 26 MSPR 330 (1985). We, therefore conclude that the agency has complied with the Board's order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 361, 368-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1998), remanded to determine the appellant's rights during a reorganization that occurred during the period he was improperly separated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the initial decision does not specifically address the issue, the Board generally considers the abolishment of the position as a compelling reason for not reinstating the appellant to his former position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 191, 199 (1996); <span class="Italic">Sink v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 628, 634 (1994). Therefore, the administrative judge compared the appellant's former duties with his current duties and concluded that the agency restored the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> because the duties of his former position were substantially equivalent in scope and status to those of his current position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In both the petition for enforcement and the petition for review, the appellant has argued that the agency improperly assigned Deer to the appellant's position. According to a declaration from the appellant's supervisor, the agency did not assign Deer to the appellant's former position; it assigned him to the position vacated by the retiring Electrical Systems Supervisor, Billy Lambert. Nevertheless, it appears that the agency may have appointed the appellant to replace Lambert if the agency had not removed the appellant prior to Lambert's retirement. According to an affidavit that the appellant submitted on June 20, 1997, Lambert supervised the appellant although they each held the same grade. It also appears that the appellant was senior to Deer since the agency originally intended to reinstate the appellant to Deer's position after subjecting Deer to RIF procedures. The appellant also claimed that Deer was promoted when the agency appointed him to replace Lambert. Because the appellant held the same grade as Lambert and was apparently senior to Deer, there is a question as to whether the agency would have appointed the appellant rather than Deer to replace Lambert if the agency had not removed the appellant. If this is the case, the appellant would be entitled to the position that Deer held prior to the appellant's reinstatement unless the agency could show that this appointment would cause undue interruption or administrative hardship. <span class="Italic">Broadnax</span>, 35 MSPR at 225-26. The administrative judge did not discuss this possibility in the initial decision, and this issue cannot be resolved from the record as it currently exists. We are therefore remanding this issue to the regional office for further adjudication. If Deer was appointed to the position that the appellant would have occupied but for his removal, then the agency did not restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> when it appointed him to a second Electrical Supervisor position that it created upon his reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5021"></span>Following remand, the AJ, the Board, and the Federal Circuit each considered, and each upheld, the agency's determination that returning Mr. Bullock to the position of electrical high voltage supervisor would have caused the agency undue interruption or administrative hardship. <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3027) (evidence "raised legitimate concerns about his ability to work in a high-stress environment").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency abolished the appellant's job during the period of the appellant's separation, the AJ may be required to adjudicate a RIF appeal following the appellant's favorable decision in his adverse action appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 246, 248 (1988) (remanding for consideration of RIF appeal when appellant petitioned for enforcement of unfiled settlement rescinding his removal; his petition raised the issue of abolition of his position after his return to duty); <span class="Italic">Brown v. GPO</span>, 13 MSPR 242, 244-45 (1982) (intervening abolition of a job was legitimate; the Board went on to consider whether new position was a sham). In <span class="Italic">Washington v. TVA</span>, 22 MSPR 377, 380 (1984), an employee was removed by adverse action in October of 1980. The Board mitigated the penalty to a reprimand in September of 1981. In November of 1981, the agency told the employee that he had been subjected to a RIF in March of 1981, his last day of work being in February of 1981. The employee was given back pay from October of 1980 through February of 1981. The AJ ordered the RIF canceled because the employee had not been included on the original RIF register due to his discharge. The Board reversed, deciding that the Board's reinstatement decision constructively placed the employee on the agency rolls during the RIF. Because the agency gave the appellant the opportunity to challenge the reconstruction of his RIF rights, it was permissible to RIF the employee retroactively; otherwise, the Board concluded, it would be placing the employee in a better position than he would have occupied had he not been removed. The cancelation of the removal should make appellant whole, but it should not result in a windfall. The agency RIF error caused by the reconstruction process, the lack of a 30-day advance notice, was subject to the harmful error rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. DHHS</span>, 36 MSPR 496, 501-02 (1988) (intervening RIF was treated as a new appealable action); <span class="Italic">Wright v.
