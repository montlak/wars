<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-246"><span class="space">p.</span> Brief Periods of Overtime</h5>
<p class="noindent">FLSA overtime may be noncompensable if it is less than ten minutes for preliminary or postliminary work closely related to the employee's principal duties, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 68 FLRA 52, 56 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412 because the Arbitrator awarded overtime pay for officers' preparatory and concluding activities that did not last more than ten minutes per workday. Section 551.412 provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If an agency reasonably determines that a preparatory or concluding activity is closely related to an employee's principal activities, and is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities, <span class="Italic">and that the total time spent in that activity is more than [ten]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> minutes per workday</span>, the agency shall credit all of the time spent in that activity, including the [ten] minutes, as hours of work.[49]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[49]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving the Agency's exception, it is necessary to distinguish between the relief officers and the non-relief officers. With regard to the relief officers, as discussed previously in section IV.A., the Arbitrator found that those officers were engaged in principal activities after they entered the gate and before they arrived at posts to relieve other officers. And we have denied the Agency's exception to that finding. Further, by its plain terms, the ten-minute rule in &#x00A7; 551.412 applies only to "preparatory or concluding activit[ies]" that are "closely related to," and "indispensable to the performance of[,]...principal activities"--not to principal activities themselves. Thus, the ten-minute rule does not apply to the relief officers' activities in this case. Although the Arbitrator discussed both the relief officers and the non-relief officers in her "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" discussion, her statements regarding the relief officers were dicta--and, thus, provide no basis for finding the award deficient. For these reasons, we find that the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 551.412 with respect to the relief officers.</p>
<p class="noindent">Preparatory work, involving picking up or exchanging equipment, of less than ten minutes is not compensable under OPM regulations, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FPC Bryan and AFGE Local 3978</span>, 67 FLRA 236, 237-38 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that awarding five minutes of overtime compensation per shift for equipment exchanges violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1). Section 551.412(a)(1) provides that, if a "preparatory or concluding activity is closely related to," and is "indispensable to the performance of," an employee's principal activities, and "the total time spent in that activity is <span class="Italic">more than [ten]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> minutes</span> per workday, the agency shall credit all of the time spent in that activity, including the [ten] minutes, as hours of work."[13] Because the Arbitrator found that officers spent less than ten minutes exchanging equipment per workday, the Agency argues that awarding them overtime compensation is contrary to &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1)--which concerns "preparatory or concluding" activities--does not apply because the Arbitrator properly found that the equipment exchange constitutes a principal activity. Further, the Union asserts that, even if the regulation applies, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that officers' equipment--exchange duties are so insubstantial that they are not compensable (the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine).[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;Opp'n at 20-22 (citing <span class="Italic">Lindow v. United States</span>, 738 F.2d 1057 (9th Cir. 1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously discussed, the Arbitrator determined that the equipment exchange is a principal activity, not a preparatory or concluding activity, as defined by &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1). Although the Union claims that the Arbitrator's conclusion constitutes a factual finding to which the Authority should defer, the characterization of a duty as a principal activity is a legal conclusion, which the Authority reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Principal activities are the activities that an employee is "employed to perform."[16] By contrast, preparatory activities are activities that are "closely related...and...indispensable to the performance of the principal activities."[17] Although the Authority has suggested that "activities that are integral and indispensable to an employee's principal...activities are themselves principal activities,"[18] we clarify that applicable Office of Personnel Management regulations distinguish principal activities from preparatory activities for federal employees.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator made no finding, and there is no claim, that equipment exchanges are the duties that guards are "employed to perform."[20] Therefore, there is no basis for the Arbitrator's conclusion that the equipment exchanges are the guards' principal activities. To the extent that the Arbitrator found that the equipment exchanges are closely related and indispensable to the performance of the guards' principal duties, that supports a conclusion that the exchanges are preparatory, not principal, activities.[21]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 551.412(a) states that a preparatory activity is not compensable unless "the total time spent in that activity is more than [ten] minutes per workday."[22] The Authority also consistently has held that an award entitling employees to overtime compensation for performing preparatory or concluding activities for ten minutes or less per workday is contrary to &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1).[23] And, although the Union cites court decisions in support of its argument that the Agency has not established a defense to liability based on the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, those decisions are inapposite because they do not concern the application of &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1), a government-wide regulation that is generally applicable to federal-government employees and contains the ten-minute requirement.[24] Consequently, because the total time awarded by the Arbitrator for the equipment exchange does not exceed ten minutes per workday, we find that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1). Therefore, we grant the Agency's exception and set aside this portion of the award.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Arbitrator found that employees assigned to the work-corridor and recreation-department posts reported to the control center ten minutes before their shifts began in order to pick up equipment, and he directed the Agency to pay those employees for that time. The Agency argues that this direction conflicts with regulations implementing the FLSA in the federal sector. Under those regulations, if a pre-shift or post-shift activity "is closely related...and is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities, and...the total time spent in that activity is <span class="Italic">more than ten minutes</span> per workday," then the time spent performing that "preparatory" or "concluding" activity is compensable under the FLSA (the ten-minute rule).[58]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, the ten-minute rule does not apply because the Arbitrator found that employees who reported early were performing principal activities during those ten minutes. To the extent that the Union argues that the Arbitrator implicitly found any activity to be a principal activity because the activity was "indispensable" to a principal activity, that argument is misplaced. As discussed above, in the federal sector, a pre-shift or post-shift activity that is "closely related" and "indispensable" to a principal activity is a preparatory or concluding activity--<span class="Italic">not</span> a principal activity.[61] Moreover, in his award, the Arbitrator made no findings that any particular activity was a principal activity. And the Arbitrator did not find that the employees were required to report ten minutes early or that reporting ten minutes early was a principal activity that the employees were "employed to perform."[63] Accordingly, <span id="page_2159"></span>the award does not support the Union's argument that, when certain employees arrived at their posts ten minutes early, they were performing a principal activity.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, if, on remand, the Arbitrator finds that the officers performed compensable preparatory or concluding activities for more than ten minutes per workday, then he should specify how much time was spent performing which activities, including security screening. We note, in this connection, that in determining whether an employee has engaged in a compensable preparatory or concluding activity, the Authority has assessed whether the activity is "an integral and indispensable part of" the employee's principal activities.[38] We also note that while this case was pending before the Authority, in <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk</span> (<span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span>),[39] the U.S. Supreme Court clarified that an activity is "integral and indispensable to the principal activities that an employee is employed to perform if it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities."[40] If the Arbitrator clarifies, on remand, that officers performed preparatory and concluding activities for more than ten minutes per workday, then he should apply the <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> standard to assess whether those individual activities are integral and indispensable activities. And, although it is premature at this time to resolve the Agency's exception regarding liquidated damages and interest (because there may be no compensation remaining after remand), we note that Authority precedent firmly holds that employees may not recover the full amount of both liquidated damages and interest under the FLSA.[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that pre-shift "preparatory" activities are activities, in contrast to principal activities, that are "closely related...and indispensable to the performance of the principal activities."[18] In the private sector, courts have held that activities that are integral and indispensable to principal activities are <span class="Italic">themselves</span> principal activities.[19] But OPM regulations that implement the FLSA and the Act in the federal sector clearly distinguish principal activities from preparatory activities.[20] In this regard, the regulations state, in pertinent part, that "a preparatory activity that an employee performs prior to the commencement of his or her principal activities...[is] not [a] principal activit[y]."[21] Thus, in the federal sector, a pre-shift activity that is "closely related" and "indispensable" to a principal activity is a preparatory activity--<span class="Italic">not</span> a principal activity.[22] And, as such, preparatory activities are only compensable if the federal employee performs them for <span class="Italic">more than ten minutes</span> per workday.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator erroneously concluded that the information exchanges are "principal" activities. As discussed above, the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span> that "integral and indispensable" activities are themselves "principal" activities does not apply in the federal sector. Consequently, the Arbitrator's application of that aspect of <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span>--and his resultant legal conclusion that the information exchanges are "principal" activities--are contrary to law.[26]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;Moreover, private-sector court decisions addressing what types of activities employees are "employed to perform" further support a conclusion that the information exchanges here were not principal activities. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bonds v. GMS Mine Repair &#x0026; Maint., Inc</span>., No. 2:13-cv-1217, 2015 WL 5602607, at *10 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 23, 2015) (employer "did not employ [employees] to attend [pre-shift safety] meetings or otherwise conduct any pre-shift activities, but to perform underground labor related to its contracted mining operations--constructing (ventilation) walls, building track, masonry, spraying walls, gopher drilling, longwall set up/recovery, etc.--as well as the above-ground activities (such as readying parts and resupplying) which were actually necessary to conduct and complete that work"); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-1">As such, the information exchanges were not principal activities. Even if they were preparatory activities, they fail to meet the ten-minute rule in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412 which requires the officers to participate in the exchanges for more than ten minutes per day in order to receive compensation under the FLSA. Accordingly, the first award is contrary to &#x00A7; 551.412, and we set it aside. As a result, there was no lawful basis for the Arbitrator to award liquidated damages or attorney fees in the second award, and we set aside that award as well.</p>
