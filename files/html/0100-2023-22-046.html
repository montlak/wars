<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-47"><span class="space">7.</span> Retirement Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A retirement appeal places the burden of proof on the employee to demonstrate the factual or legal error of OPM. If the evidence demonstrating the error was provided to OPM prior to the completion of the agency's reconsideration process, a fee request following a successful Board appeal is considered under the "knew or should have known" standard, subsequently discussed. If the determinative evidence was first introduced at the Board hearing, the determinative standard for the fee is whether the failure of OPM to modify its position prior to the Board decision was clearly without merit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Triplett v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 377, 381 n.4 (1987). The "clearly without merit" standard most often comes into play when the focus is not on the reconsideration decision, but instead on OPM's failure to grant retirement when, during the MSPB appeal, it is presented with but fails to act on evidence that should cause OPM to change its retirement determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farrero v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 630, 634 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 28 MSPR 106, 108-09 (1985)). The Board's analytical approach is explained in a series of 1987 decisions. [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-22-010.html#sec15-11">Retirement Appeal</a>" concerning the "<a href="0100-2023-22-050.html#sec15-51">Knew or Should Have Known</a>" standard.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The focus in retirement fee cases under the clearly without merit standard may be whether it was blameworthy for OPM to have failed, at some point prior to the close of the appellate record, to acknowledge the appellant's entitlement to benefits. <span class="Italic">Sargent v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 416, 420 (1987) (remanding for credibility determinations to permit findings on whether the evidence provided by the appellant at the hearing was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to the appellant's eligibility for annuity). The "record" includes the evidence before OPM as well as the evidence produced to MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kinard v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 265, 275 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Regnier v. OPM</span>, 72 MSPR 229, 234 (1996) (AJ's evaluation of the demeanor of the appellant did not control the analysis of annuity entitlement and should not have defeated a fee request when evidence in the possession of OPM should have resulted in a grant of retirement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kent v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 361, 367-69 (1987), outlined the basic considerations governing fee applications in successful retirement appeals. Concerning the clearly without merit standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record on which OPM's reconsideration decision was based may have been such that it would not have known that it could not prevail on the merits, the Board recognizes that there are circumstances when fees nevertheless will be warranted in the interest of justice. When the agency's reconsideration decision would not have been reversed in the absence of the evidence adduced during the appellate process, it is appropriate to resolve the request for a fee award based on an analysis of the "clearly without merit" category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e are aware of no concept of justice that compels an award of fees simply because an applicant introduces evidence before the Board that rectifies his failure of proof....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we conclude that the fact that the appellant finally prevails does not end the inquiry into whether the agency's denial of the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement was clearly without merit. Rather, we must consider presentation of evidence by the appellant and determine whether the agency's failure, at some point prior to the close of the appellate record, to acknowledge the appellant's entitlement to benefits was blameworthy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making such a determination, we must consider the totality of the evidence and consider, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, (1) whether the appellant was misled by OPM to his detriment or whether OPM's initial decision was insufficient under the circumstances to permit a reasonable person to identify the kind of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration; (2) the extent to which the reversal was based on evidence that the appellant did not present to OPM, but that nevertheless was readily available to OPM; and (3) the extent to which the appellant produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for an annuity and OPM's continued refusal to approve a disability retirement annuity for the appellant prolonged the adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Kent</span> analysis was further explained in <span class="Italic">Callan v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 150, 154-55 (1987), interpreting the "clearly without merit" standard under the rubric of the "compelling evidence" standard or test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third <span class="Italic">Kent</span> factor can be termed the compelling evidence standard or test. Although the <span class="Italic">Kent</span> decision explained the general rationale which led the Board to develop the three <span class="Italic">Kent</span> factors, it did not explicitly discuss the special considerations which support the compelling evidence test....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize the fact that the compelling evidence test is a significantly higher standard than is applicable to other attorney fee cases where the appellant seeks to prove that the agency's action was clearly without merit. However, requiring appellants in employee-initiated retirement actions to meet this higher burden is fully justified by public policy considerations and the special nature of such appeals. First, as we explained in <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, the position of an appellant in a retirement case who fails to marshall sufficient evidence before OPM is entirely different from that of an appellant in a chapter 43 or 75 action who is wrongfully accused of misconduct or unacceptable performance....&#8197;Second, when retirement applicants choose to forgo their opportunity to submit sufficient evidence to OPM where they are on notice of what kind of evidence was needed, they must take responsibility for the ensuing Board proceeding....&#8197;Thus, the compelling evidence standard serves to encourage retirement annuity applicants to present sufficient evidence to OPM and to not rely on the Board proceeding to rectify their failure of proof. This will in turn discourage unnecessary proceedings before the Board and the courts and the attorney fees that are incurred as a result of those proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Callan</span>, a factually close case, evidence at the hearing that "tips the scales" is not so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to annuity eligibility. <span class="Italic">Leppelman v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 204, 210 (1987) (dispute as to the competency of an annuitant was resolved through psychiatric evidence introduced for the first time at the hearing); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 31, 35 (1993) (denying fees based on a close choice between physicians' conflicting opinions); <span class="Italic">Mansfield v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 602, 607 (1997) ("The evidence of record does not reflect a factually close case in which the evidence at the hearing acted simply to tip the scales, but rather was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to annuity eligibility.")<span class="Italic">. Callan</span> noted of the method of analysis of the "compelling evidence" standard, 34 MSPR at 156:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for our inquiry is the initial decision which reversed OPM's reconsideration decision and became the Board's final decision on the merits in this case....&#8197;The appellant's entitlement to attorney fees must be viewed from the vantage point of that decision. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1984).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In determining whether an appellant is entitled to an award of attorney fees, it is not appropriate for the Board or its administrative judges to reweigh or recharacterize the evidence....&#8197;However, the question of whether the evidence of record, given the weight attributed to it on the decision on the merits, meets the compelling evidence standard is a conclusion of law. Consequently, the Board is not bound by the conclusion of an administrative judge on this point.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mansfield v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 602, 605 (1997), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, we identified the two <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories which are the most relevant in determining whether an award of attorney fees may be warranted in the interest of justice in a disability retirement appeal: (1) Whether OPM "knew or should have known" that it would not prevail on the merits when it issued its reconsideration decision; and (2) whether the reconsideration decision was "clearly without merit," i.e., when OPM's reconsideration decision would not have been reversed in the absence of evidence adduced during the appellate process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ortiz v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 47, 50-53 (1987), elaborated on the criteria applying the clearly without merit standard to retirement cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4576"></span>OPM asserts specifically that the administrative judge erred in finding that its action was clearly without merit while also finding that the appellant provided it with insufficient proof of his continued disability. The administrative judge correctly found that, in general, the clearly without merit criterion for awarding attorney fees focuses on the result of the case before the Board, not on the evidence and information available to the agency prior to the hearing. <span class="Italic">Grant v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Transportation,</span> 28 MSPR 106, 108-09 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kent,</span> however, the Board determined that although the clearly without merit standard may apply in a disability retirement case, it does not apply in precisely the same way as it does in cases where the agency has the burden of proof. Rather, the Board must consider the presentation of evidence by the appellant and determine whether OPM's failure, at some point before the close of the appellate record, to acknowledge the appellant's entitlement to benefits was blameworthy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 368. In making that determination, the Board will consider <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>: (1) Whether the appellant was misled by OPM to his detriment or whether OPM's initial decision was insufficient under the circumstances to permit a reasonable person to identify the kind of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration; (2) the extent to which the reversal was based on evidence that the appellant did not present to OPM, but that nevertheless was readily available to OPM; and (3) the extent to which the appellant produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for an annuity and OPM's continued refusal to approve a disability retirement annuity for the appellant prolonged the adjudication. When a fee award is based on OPM's continued, improper refusal to approve an annuity, the award will be limited to those fees incurred after OPM was made aware of the dispositive evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 368-69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant was not misled or provided with insufficient information by OPM concerning the type of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration. The administrative judge found that the appellant did not provide OPM with sufficient proof of his continued disability even though it asked for such evidence. In addition, the record shows that before it issued its initial decision, OPM requested medical documentation detailing the status of the medical condition that caused the appellant's disability and addressing the appellant's ability to perform useful and efficient service. Despite OPM's finding in its initial decision that the appellant was no longer disabled, the appellant did not submit additional medical evidence with his reconsideration petition, but rather relied on the statement submitted with his initial petition. In the reconsideration decision, OPM concluded that the medical evidence failed to establish that the appellant's condition rendered him incapable of performing useful and efficient service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the second factor, we find that the evidence that caused the reconsideration decision to be reversed was not readily available to OPM. This information did not come from OPM's files or sources, but from the appellant, his wife, and his personal physician.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third <span class="Italic">Kent</span> factor can [be] termed the compelling evidence standard or test. In <span class="Italic">Callan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 34 MSPR 150, 154, (1987), we recognized that this was a significantly higher standard than is applicable to other attorney fee cases where the appellant seeks to prove that the agency's action was clearly without merit. In <span class="Italic">Callan,</span> we further discussed the policy reasons which justify this higher burden for appellants who seek attorney fees on this basis in employee-initiated retirement actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that the appellant in the instant case did adduce evidence at the hearing that was so compelling--viewed in the context of the totality of the evidence--that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion in this regard is supported by the evidentiary findings of the administrative judge, as well as by our own assessment that the evidence, given the weight attributed to it by the administrative judge, meets the compelling evidence standard (footnote omitted). In the initial decision in this case, which became the Board's final decision on the merits, the administrative judge concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In sum, the expert testimony of appellant's treating physician clearly explains why appellant is still precluded from performing his former federal job. The physician's testimony is corroborated by the credible testimony of appellant and his wife. The total hearing testimony, thus, goes far beyond a mere showing of stress and discomfort,...and overwhelmingly establishes that appellant continues to be unable to render useful and efficient service in his former federal position due to a severe gastrointestinal disability which is inextricably related to stress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This finding clearly supports the conclusion that, by the end the hearing on February 27, 1986, the appellant had adduced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for an annuity. The record does not reflect that OPM either attended the hearing or was otherwise actually informed thereafter of the testimony received. Nevertheless, we consider the <span class="Italic">Kent</span> decision, at 369 n.6, to include constructive knowledge of hearing evidence that an agency in litigation would normally acquire by its presence in the court room. Otherwise, OPM could prolong meritless cases and concurrently insulate itself from an attorney fee award simply by failing to attend Board hearings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A second factor that leads us to conclude that the appellant met the compelling evidence test is the nature and quality of the evidence on which the administrative judge relied in reversing OPM's action. We note particularly, as the administrative judge did, the testimony of Dr. Garcia, the appellant's treating physician. Dr. Garcia was a board certified physician in the fields of Gastroenterology and Internal Medicine, both of which were highly relevant to the medical conditions at issue in this appeal. A review of the record demonstrates that Dr. Garcia's testimony was consistent with his previous medical reports (footnote omitted), consistent with the other medical evidence (footnote omitted), and corroborated by the credible testimony of the appellant and his wife. Because the total hearing testimony left little room for doubt that the appellant was entitled to continue receiving an annuity, we find that it met the compelling evidence standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OPM unduly prolonged the adjudication by submitting a brief after the appellant presented compelling evidence of his entitlement to an annuity. We find that OPM's action in prolonging the proceeding beyond the hearing was clearly without merit, and that attorney fees for the counsel's subsequent service are therefore in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holmes v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 330, 335-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15 (2005), provides an example of the "clearly without merit" analysis as to an annuity benefit that was denied, and later granted, when it was determined that a dispositive certificate pertaining to eligibility was the product of forgery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To award fees under the "clearly without merit" standard in a retirement appeal, the Board must determine that, at some point prior to the close of the appellate record, OPM's failure to acknowledge the appellant's entitlement to the benefits he sought was blameworthy. <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. at 551; <span class="Italic">Goldbach</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 15. To make this determination, the Board considers whether the appellant was misled by OPM or whether OPM failed to put him on notice of the kind of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration; the extent to which reversal was based on evidence not presented by the appellant but readily available to OPM; and the extent to which the appellant produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for an annuity and OPM's continued refusal to approve the annuity prolonged the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 551. When a fee award is based on OPM's continued, improper refusal to approve an annuity, the award will be limited to those fees incurred after OPM was made aware of the dispositive evidence. <span class="Italic">Goldbach</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that OPM did not mislead the appellant or fail to put him on notice of the type of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration. Although we do note that the record indicates that OPM failed to apprise the appellant of any particular information it would require in order to reverse its initial decision, OPM's initial decision was clearly based on its belief that the appellant had signed a consent form. In fact, OPM provided the appellant with a copy of the signed consent form on which it relied. The appellant was, therefore, on notice that he would need to provide evidence persuading OPM that the signature on the consent form was forged. In fact, he provided handwriting samples, and sent a letter stating that additional evidence, including a handwriting expert's analysis and information regarding the appellant's incarceration, would be forthcoming, <span class="Italic">id</span>. The appellant's response clearly indicates that he was on notice of the type of evidence he would need to prevail on reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we note that the reversal of OPM's reconsideration decision was not based on evidence readily available to it. On appeal, the AJ considered the written opinion, dated January 22, 2004, of a handwriting expert, an affidavit, dated March 2, 2004, of an official at the prison where the appellant is incarcerated, and a sworn affidavit, dated February 19, 2004, of the notary who supposedly witnessed the appellant's signing the consent form. Clearly, this evidence was not available to OPM when it issued its December 2, 2003 reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the record does not show that OPM prolonged the proceedings after the point at which the dispositive evidence was submitted. The opinion of the handwriting expert was not submitted to the Board until February 6, 2004, and the affidavits of the notary and the prison official were not submitted until March 12, 2004. The March 12, 2004 submissions were the last by either party before the AJ's initial decision, which was issued on March 24, 2004. We note that the Board has found that OPM does not needlessly prolong the proceeding merely by awaiting the AJ's decision rather than vacating its decision and granting the annuity immediately. <span class="Italic">Short v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 136, 143 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its PFR, OPM also takes issue with the appellant's arguments below that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice <span id="Page_4577"></span>because the appellant is incarcerated, and because OPM should have retained its own expert to do a handwriting analysis after the appellant claimed that the signature on the consent form was a forgery. We are aware of no legal authority for the proposition that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice on the basis that the appellant is incarcerated and, therefore, is allegedly unable to prosecute his appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. Moreover, because the burden of proof is on the appellant to prove entitlement to survivor annuity benefits, <span class="Italic">see Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986), OPM was not obliged to retain an expert to analyze the appellant's handwriting, particularly when the appellant promised to submit expert evidence himself but failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the dispositive evidence is received by OPM after the close of the record, fees will not be awarded under the clearly without merit standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Overton v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 8, 12 (1993). <span class="Italic">Walls v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 368, 372 (1987), noted a result reached under the third <span class="Italic">Kent</span> factor, i.e., production of compelling evidence not acted upon by OPM. The appellant's exhibits were submitted to the AJ shortly before the briefing deadline. The Board concluded that even if the exhibits plainly demonstrated entitlement to retirement, no fees would be awarded. There was no expenditure of legal time between the submission of the exhibits and issuance of a favorable initial decision. <span class="Italic">Lee v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 650, 654 (1987), explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the "compelling evidence" standard, an appellant is only entitled to those fees incurred after the OPM has been made aware of the dispositive evidence....&#8197;In the instant case, the dispositive evidence was adduced at the hearing, and there is no showing that any attorney fees were incurred after the hearing. The case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 MSPR 47, 53 (1987), where the OPM unduly prolonged the proceedings by submitting a posthearing brief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the "compelling evidence" formulation, the Board considers whether evidence submitted during the appeals process was so clear that reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome. <span class="Italic">Myrick v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 533, 538 (1988); <span class="Italic">Belcher v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 362, 366 (1988) (reciting <span class="Italic">Kent</span> criteria); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Biscaha v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 500, 506-07 (1992) (once the agency submitted the revised certification that appellant could not be accommodated through reassignment, reasonable minds could not differ as to the appellant's eligibility for disability annuity; fees were warranted from that point forward). If the evidence adduced at the hearing is controlling, but no fees are incurred after the hearing, the "compelling evidence" test is considered immaterial. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chiodo v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 479, 484-85 (1988). If a fee award is warranted on the basis of OPM's continued improper refusal to approve an annuity, the award is limited to the fees incurred after OPM became aware of the dispositive evidence. <span class="Italic">Kinard v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 265, 271 (1988). Under <span class="Italic">Kinard</span>, if OPM grants the annuity immediately after it receives the dispositive evidence, no fees are warranted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barron v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 607, 615-16 (1991) (fees denied: OPM acted upon the receipt of controlling evidence concerning a service credit; OPM did not mislead the appellant or contribute to a delay in obtaining information about appellant's service credit history); <span class="Italic">Craven v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 128, 135 (1989) (fees awarded for time spent after the submission of compelling evidence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Obremski v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 554, 556-57 (1986), awarded fees under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 2 ("clearly without merit" or "wholly unfounded") to an individual who successfully challenged the agency's denial of early retirement benefits as a result of his status as a law enforcement officer. 5 USC 8336(c)(1). The basis for the award was that fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]hould be awarded in a legal retirement case if the Board finds that the agency based its case on incredible or unspecific evidence or reasoning fully countered by the record. We base this holding on the rationale that the agency's denial of benefits or credit, in the absence of justifiable reason supported by specific credible evidence or analysis, results in the expenditure of unnecessary fees by the applicant, and that such fees should be reimbursed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stewart v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 544, 551-53 (1996), provided analysis under the clearly without merit standard applied to both OPM's treatment of the appellant's reconsideration request and to OPM's subsequent actions in the Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To award attorney fees under this criterion, the Board must determine that, at some point prior to the close of the appellate record, OPM's failure to acknowledge the appellant's entitlement to the benefits he sought was blameworthy. To make this determination, the Board considers: (1) Whether the appellant was misled by OPM or whether OPM failed to put him on notice of the kind of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration; (2) the extent to which reversal was based on evidence not presented by the appellant but readily available to OPM; and (3) the extent to which the appellant produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for a waiver and OPM's continued refusal to approve the annuity prolonged the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Overton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 MSPR 8, 11-12 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that the evidence does not show that OPM misled or failed to put the appellant on notice of the kind of evidence needed to prevail on reconsideration. As previously stated, the evidence indicates that OPM provided the appellant with an FRQ [Financial Resources Questionnaire] with its initial decision concerning the overpayment or, at the least, provided the appellant with sufficient notice that he should request such a document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the reversal of OPM's reconsideration decision was not based on evidence that was readily available to OPM. A review of the initial decision reveals that the administrative judge based his decision to reverse OPM's denial of waiver on the appellant's amended FRQ, which was submitted to the Board and to OPM on March 20, 1995, and on the appellant's June 8, 1995 affidavit. Obviously, this evidence was not available to OPM when it reissued its reconsideration decision on January 11, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, although this evidence could be considered so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to the appellant's eligibility for a waiver, the record shows that OPM did not prolong the proceedings after this point. The appellant appears to argue that OPM needlessly prolonged the proceedings by belatedly questioning the accuracy of his March 20, 1995 FRQ. As noted above, however, even before the appellant submitted his March 20, 1995 FRQ, the administrative judge expressed his belief during a March 13, 1995 telephonic status conference that the appellant could not obtain a waiver of collection of the overpayment if he prevailed on his involuntary retirement appeal and suggested placing the appeal on hold or dismissing the appeal without prejudice until the involuntary retirement appeal was resolved. Moreover, in submitting his March 20, 1995 FRQ, the appellant agreed with the administrative judge that his appeal concerning the overpayment should be stayed because the issue would be moot if he obtained backpay from his involuntary retirement appeal. He reiterated this position in an April 14, 1995 submission. Accordingly, as previously noted, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice on this basis. Thus, the appellant has not explained why OPM should have continued to engage in proceedings related to his annuity overpayment appeal by reviewing and questioning his FRQ, when both parties had agreed that the appeal could be rendered moot and the administrative judge had in fact dismissed the appeal. Thus, he has not shown that OPM needlessly prolonged the proceedings by not questioning his FRQ until he refiled his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant has not shown that OPM acted unreasonably in questioning the FRQ after he refiled his appeal. The amended FRQ listed the appellant's average monthly income as $317 and his average monthly expenses as $897. It stated that he paid the difference by sharing some living expenses with his mother and getting some assistance from his family. It further noted that he was paying one debt on installment. In questioning the FRQ, OPM stated that it did not find credible the appellant's claim that his reasonable and necessary expenses exceed his monthly income by more than $500 on a continuing and recurring basis. OPM further stated that the appellant listed no substantial liquid assets, did not sufficiently explain what happened to his VSIP, and did not indicate that he had a spouse or spousal income although its records showed that he had elected an annuity reduction to provide a survivor annuity for his spouse and his annuity was being reduced for that purpose. OPM explained that family income must be considered in determining repayment capability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that OPM did not needlessly prolong the proceeding by questioning the FRQ. As the administrative judge himself found in his initial decision, "an individual obviously cannot financially survive for long when his monthly expenses exceed his monthly income by $580." Thus, OPM's decision to question such a large discrepancy between income and expenses cannot be considered blameworthy. Similarly, the appellant did not explain the disposition of his lump-sum VSIP until he filed the affidavit, in which he explained that he used it to pay outstanding debt when he retired. OPM's decision to question the appellant's claim that he had no substantial liquid assets, after he had admittedly received a $25,000 lump-sum payment when he retired cannot be considered blameworthy. Finally, the appellant explained for the first time that, although he is married, he has been separated from his wife for twelve years and he receives no income from her. Nonetheless, he chose to provide a survivor annuity for his wife. Certainly, OPM cannot be faulted for questioning an FRQ that lists no spousal income when its records indicated that the appellant had elected a survivor annuity for his wife. Indeed, the initial decision reflects that OPM did not have this information until after it filed its final submission on the merits in this case. As previously noted, the administrative judge relied on the appellant's affidavit in reversing OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only documents in the record after the appellant submitted his June 8, 1995 affidavit are an order from the administrative judge urging OPM to settle the case and the initial decision. The Board has indicated that requiring an administrative judge to issue an initial decision does not constitute needlessly prolonging the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Walls v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 MSPR 368, 372 (1987). OPM did not file a <span id="Page_4578"></span>petition for review of the initial decision, and thus OPM did not prolong the proceedings by requiring review of the administrative judge's decision to grant the waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we conclude that the appellant has failed to establish that he is entitled to an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goldbach v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 9, 15 (1991) (restating criteria).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Initially, the Board determined that OPM was deemed constructively aware of evidence even if it did not participate in the Board's hearing. <span class="Italic">Short v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 219, 222 (1994) ("OPM needlessly prolonged the adjudication by choosing not to participate in person at the hearing, or in any other way making itself aware of the evidence presented there by the appellant"). <span class="Italic">Short v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 136, 141-44 (1996), reconsidered the earlier decision and explained that fees should not be awarded when dispositive evidence is introduced at a hearing not attended by OPM and OPM fails to reverse its retirement decision before filing written closing argument with the AJ. OPM was not required to revise its decision based on the hearing evidence to avoid fees; whatever work was performed after the hearing by appellant's counsel could not fairly be charged to OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director contends that the Board rested its award of fees solely on the fact that OPM did not personally appear at the hearing, in effect requiring such an appearance by OPM in every retirement appeal. Such a requirement, he contends, is contrary to <span class="Italic">McEachern v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 776 F.2d 1539, 1544 (Fed. Cir. 1985), and <span class="Italic">Pitzak v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 710 F.2d 1476, 1480 (10th Cir. 1983), which rejected arguments that OPM's failure to participate in the hearing in a retirement appeal warranted reversal of its decision. To the extent the Board based its finding of liability on OPM's failure to participate in the hearing, rather than on its conduct after the hearing, we agree that the Board misinterpreted <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 MSPR 47, 53 (1987), which held that OPM needlessly prolonged the proceeding by filing a brief after the appellant submitted compelling evidence in support of his claim. However, with respect to the ruling in <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> that OPM is deemed to have knowledge of the hearing evidence even if it did not participate in the hearing, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 52, we disagree that this rule requires OPM to appear in person at the hearing. The rule merely recognizes that OPM has an opportunity to appear and therefore makes OPM, rather than the appellant, responsible for additional fees unnecessarily incurred after the hearing. It does not require an award of fees in every case where the appellant prevails at the hearing, as OPM mistakenly argues. The rule applies only in those cases where the appellant has presented evidence so compelling that OPM cannot thereafter reasonably dispute the appellant's entitlement to benefits, but where OPM continues to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> the Board awarded fees not because of anything OPM failed to do at the hearing but because it found that OPM unduly prolonged the adjudication beyond the hearing by submitting a brief after the appellant presented testimony at the hearing which was compelling evidence of his entitlement to an annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 53. <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> concluded that an award of fees for the appellant's counsel's "subsequent service" was therefore in the interest of justice and ordered OPM to compensate the appellant's counsel for the two hours which he spent preparing the appellant's closing argument. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in contrast to the award in <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span>, attorney fees were awarded for the bulk of the appellant's counsel's time during the hearing, as well as for hours which followed the hearing. In this respect, the Board's decision departed from its precedents. For example, in <span class="Italic">Goldbach v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 MSPR 9, 18 (1991), the Board found that the appellant presented compelling evidence of her entitlement to an annuity at the hearing and awarded her attorney fees "for work performed after the hearing at which this evidence was submitted." <span class="Italic">See also Biscaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 54 MSPR 500, 506-07 (1992) (awarding the appellant fees for work performed after the date on which OPM received the dispositive evidence supporting her claim).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other cases where the dispositive evidence was presented at the hearing, no fees were awarded because OPM took no further action to oppose the appellant's claim and no additional legal services were performed on the appellant's behalf after the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barron v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 MSPR 607, 611, 616 (1991) (where OPM after evaluating the appellant's hearing evidence rescinded its reconsideration decision shortly after the hearing, OPM did not needlessly prolong the proceedings); <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 MSPR 131, 134 (1988) (even if the hearing testimony was compelling, OPM did not persist in defending its decision and so did not generate more fees for appellant by causing more work by his counsel); <span class="Italic">Chiodo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 MSPR 479, 485 (1988) (even if the appellant's hearing evidence was compelling, appellant incurred no fees between the end of the hearing and OPM's submission indicating that it had complied); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 35 MSPR 650, 654 (1987) (OPM submitted no documents following the hearing at which the dispositive evidence was adduced and the appellant incurred no attorney fees after the hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under the Board's precedents fees should not have been awarded for time spent presenting the appellant's evidence at the hearing. Awarding fees for this time is inconsistent with the Board's previous implicit recognition of OPM's need to evaluate the weight of the appellant's new evidence. <span class="Italic">See Barron</span>, 47 MSPR at 611, 616 (OPM did not needlessly prolong the proceeding where two days after the hearing at which the appellant's compelling evidence was presented it moved to dismiss on the ground that, after evaluating the evidence, it had determined to grant the retirement credit at issue). It would be unreasonable to find OPM's conduct blameworthy where its actions occurred prior to its having even a constructive opportunity to review the appellant's dispositive evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A different issue is presented by the award for counsel's posthearing services. In opposing an award for these services, OPM relies on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Walls v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 MSPR 368 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Walls</span> the Board declined to decide whether the appellant's evidence was compelling because, although OPM submitted a closing brief after receiving the appellant's dispositive hearing exhibits, there was no indication in the record that the appellant made any additional submissions. Once the initial decision issued, OPM complied "and thereby obviated the need for any further fees to be incurred." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 372. Thus, even if the appellant's evidence was compelling, the Board found, "no fees would be awardable because none were incurred after the time at which OPM was apprised of the dispositive evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, the appellant submitted no response to the written closing statement which OPM filed on the day of the hearing. Although the appellant's counsel did perform additional services for him after the hearing, the time was not spent on replying to OPM's arguments. The Board's prior decision awarded four hours of posthearing time, but upon further examination we find that the record actually supports only one hour of post-hearing time spent by the appellant's counsel on review of the Board's decision and "follow-up." OPM contends that it should not be required to pay the appellant's attorney fees for this time because its closing statement did not prolong the proceeding or cause fees to be incurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that under the third prong of the "clearly without merit" standard, as explained in <span class="Italic">Kent</span> and subsequent cases, OPM is liable only for those fees which it causes to be incurred by actions unjustifiably prolonging the proceeding. Counsel's review of the Board's decision would presumably have occurred in any event and was not the result of action by OPM. Apart from its brief, OPM took no other action after the appellant's evidence was submitted which would make it liable for fees under <span class="Italic">Kent.</span> OPM does not needlessly prolong the proceeding merely by awaiting the administrative judge's decision rather than vacating its decision and granting the annuity immediately. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 MSPR 544, 552-53 (1996), citing <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, 34 MSPR at 372. Because the post-hearing time spent by the appellant's counsel was not caused by OPM's conduct, we find that no fees for it are awardable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goldbach v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 9, 18-19 (1991) (although fees may not be appropriate under the compelling evidence test for time spent on the case before the hearing, fees may be justified for that time under some other <span class="Italic">Kent</span> factor, e.g., OPM's negligent initial consideration of the case); <span class="Italic">Farrero v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 630, 635 (1987) ("Despite the persuasiveness of this evaluation, however, OPM prolonged the adjudication by allowing the case to proceed to the Board hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it is possible to construct a theory that OPM should have obtained evidence or clarification on its own initiative (e.g., through further inquiry to the employing agency), MSPB will evaluate the likely outcome of any inquiry that might have been made and fees will be denied if it is not likely that the inquiry, if reasonably required on the part of OPM, would have resulted in production of determinative information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Biscaha v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 500, 506-07 (1992).</p>
