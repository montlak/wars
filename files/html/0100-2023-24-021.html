<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-21"><span class="space">c.</span> Court Practice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Practice before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is aided by the clerk and his staff. It is complicated by detailed rules governing briefing and by an unforgivingly complex electronic filing system. The court operates in accordance with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and local rules published by the Federal Circuit. The clerk's office publishes and distributes a set of "United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Rules of Practice," most recently revised and reissued in printed form in December 2021, supplemented by additional guidance, available on the court's website, concerning complex electronic filing procedures and associated briefing and appendix requirements. The rules booklet contains Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Federal Circuit Rules, "practice notes," checklists, and links to standardized forms, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/RulesProceduresAndForms/FederalCircuitRules/FederalCircuitRulesofPractice.pdf">https://cafc.uscourts.gov/wp-content/uploads/RulesProceduresAndForms/FederalCircuitRules/FederalCircuitRulesofPractice.pdf</a>. The practice notes are permissive and do not establish legal obligations. <span class="Italic">Byrne v. United States</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-5006). On the website of the court is also a "Guide for <span class="Italic">Pro Se</span> Petitioners and Appellants." Mention is made of the description from the court, "The Life of an Appeal," complete with flowchart. All these materials are on the court's website, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/">cafc.uscourts.gov</a>. The circuit website also contains a "Guide for Motions Practice." If counsel has a question concerning procedure, an answer can generally be obtained from the Clerk's helpful staff by a telephone call to the Federal Circuit Clerk's office at (202) 275-8000. Check for revisions to the Circuit's rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2005 the Federal Circuit instituted a mediation program in an effort to settle appeals. <span class="Italic">Pro se</span> appeals are excluded, but other civil service cases appear to be within the scope of the program. Information and forms relating to use of the mediation program are available from the court's website, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/home/case-information/mediation/">https://cafc.uscourts.gov/home/case-information/mediation/</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Starting in 2012, the court began using mandatory electronic filing of briefs and appendices through the PACER system. It takes a time to learn how to use the system. A help desk is helpful. Eventually the material gets filed once counsel properly follows the process to put filings into the machine-readable pdf format and successfully navigates the uploading system. Appeals litigated <span class="Italic">pro se</span> may permit paper filings of some documents, and the Federal Circuit website should be consulted for the state of current procedures, or call the court clerk's office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit publishes guidance on courtroom decorum, including a dress code (one would not think necessary for the patent bar). The instructions, taken from the court's section on "Courtroom Attire," <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/home/oral-argument/attending-oral-arguments/">https://cafc.uscourts.gov/home/oral-argument/attending-oral-arguments/</a>, must result from interesting experiences of a court that is unknown to most of the public, well-guarded, and seemingly isolated from the hurly-burly of other courts of a more general jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dignity of the Court is to be respected and maintained at all times.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attire for counsel and spectators should be restrained and appropriate to the dignity of a Court of Appeals of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Court security officers and Court staff are authorized to open and inspect any item carried into a courtroom.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Everyone in the courtroom, unless physically unable to do so, must rise when the judges enter and remain standing until the presiding judge invites everyone to be seated. Similarly, when court adjourns, everyone stands in place until the judges are no longer visible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Standing in the courtroom may be permitted only at the discretion of the Clerk. Areas marked as reserved are for Court Staff and Federal Circuit Law Clerks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Only members in good standing of the Federal Circuit bar may sit either at counsel tables or within the well of the court when court is in session.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel may address the court when invited to do so. Only counsel associated with the appeal being argued may address the Court, unless a judge directs otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Coats, outerwear, and large bags must be stored at the coat racks outside the courtroom areas. Arguing counsel may bring in bags containing materials necessary for argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Only material relating to the Court's business can be read in the courtroom while court is in session.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Government representation in the Federal Circuit for MSPB cases is generally conducted by the attorneys in the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division of the Justice Department; MSPB attorneys appear as counsel in appeals involving jurisdictional or timeliness issues. A word of caution to agencies with independent litigating authority: the Federal Circuit has come to rely upon the Justice Department for its expertise in civilian personnel cases. Some Circuit judges are drawn from the Justice Department.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On rare occasion, the Federal Circuit has criticized the defense conducted by the Justice Department in an appealed Board decision, and the court has pointed out that the role of the Justice Department is to assist in the administration of justice, rather than to simply attempt to win cases, as in a retirement benefits appeal, <span class="Italic">Byrum v. OPM</span>, 618 F.3d 1323, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2010), in an opinion written by Judge Plager for the court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... The Justice Department's defense of OPM's decision and of the Board's affirmance is simply inexplicable. It is not the duty of the Justice Department simply to try to win cases for the Government; as President Lincoln famously said, "It is as much the duty of Government to render prompt justice against itself, in favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same, between private individuals."[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;First Annual Message to Congress (Dec. 3, 1861). This quotation is engraved at the entrance to our courthouse.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are hundreds of Federal Circuit <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appeals each year in addition to the appeals from represented appellants. Concerned with the confusing notices about judicial review rights drafted by the MSPB, the Federal Circuit's clerk wrote to the Board's clerk on January 10, 1986, asking that the Board include notice in its final decisions of the statutory nature of its review authority and the time limits for filing a judicial petition for review. The letter also asked the Board to include a notice to counsel for appellants in its final decision: "You are requested to advise appellant of the right under 5 USC section 7703 to petition for judicial review of this action of the Board and whether in your opinion there are nonfrivolous grounds to support such a petition."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court expects that counsel will meet established deadlines and follow its rules. Failure to file an appeal on time will not be excused. Counsel's ignorance or neglect as to the timeliness of other filings will not lightly be excused. Appeals have been dismissed for failure of counsel to timely file a brief or a formal waiver of EEO claims. Counsel throughout the country who find other courts more forgiving of occasional lapses would do well to take special care in meeting the deadlines imposed by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and by the Federal Circuit Rules. When in doubt about the application of a particular rule or the customs followed in the Federal Circuit, call the Clerk's office. If technical rules are not followed, e.g., rules governing compilation of briefs and appendices, counsel may be on the receiving end of a letter <span id="Page_5183"></span>rejecting the materials he has so carefully prepared and attempted to file. Although an extension for proper filing will likely be granted, the aggravation of performing twice what should be properly completed once is punishment enough for failure to carefully follow the appellate rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning briefs to the court, keep the judges in mind as briefs are prepared. Judge Harry Edwards of the D.C. Circuit made a few suggestions at a conference that are worthy of note: a good advocate adds subtlety to a case; eye fatigue, and even irritability, set in long before the final page. Take the caustic comments concerning your opponent and the MSPB AJ out of the second draft. Explain with care what is at stake in the appeal.

<p class="Body-Text">As to the tone of briefs, keep them civil. Of the parties' submissions in <span class="Italic">Nissim Corp. v. ClearPlay, Inc</span>., 499 Fed. Appx. 23, 27 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), the court stated at n.4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The excessive hyperbole in the briefs makes them difficult to take seriously and unpleasant to read, and strips both parties of their credibility. Nissim characterizes ClearPlay's arguments as "moan[ing] ," "excuse[s] ," and "absurd"; it describes one of ClearPlay's communications with the special master as "bias-inducing screed." ClearPlay's briefs are no better; disparaging Nissim's suit as "unnecessarily time-consuming and expensive," "ill conceived," "wast[ing] the time and resources of ClearPlay and the [c]ourt," and a "massive waste of judicial time and resources," and referring to Nissim's arguments "inexplicable," "strange," and "baffling." The record reveals the parties' behavior in the district court proceedings to be even worse. The parties would be well-advised to take the advice of Justice Scalia and Bryan Garner: "Cultivate a tone of civility, showing that you are not blinded by passion.... A straightforward recital of the facts will arouse whatever animosity the appellate court is capable of entertaining, without detracting from the appearance of calm and equanimity that you want to project." Antonin Scalia &#x0026; Bryan A. Garner, <span class="Italic">Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges</span> 34-35 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' poor judgment extends beyond their choice of words. For example, Nissim stated that "the district court stuck Nissim with ClearPlay's trivial gesture" and that the court's decision "mock[ed] justice."These statements were at best unprofessional. <span class="Italic">See</span> ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct Rules 3.5, 8.4(d). ClearPlay's statements throughout its brief that Nissim had requested only prospective relief were obvious misrepresentations that cannot easily be explained away as mistakes. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Rule 3.3(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While we are speaking of rules and briefs, although many nonprecedential decisions of the Federal Circuit are noted in the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>, none of them may be cited to the court in a brief or during argument except as the Circuit's rules allow. The nonprecedential decisions are noted for three reasons: first, they are some indication of judicial thinking and provide citations to precedent that may be useful in research; second, if counsel is not aware of them, counsel is not in a position to take advantage of the rule that permits publication and citation of nonprecedential decisions; and third, they show the ultimate disposition of particular MSPB cases that are discussed in the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> (if you are going to rely upon an MSPB decision, it is comforting to know that it has not been reversed on appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Arguments in cases are usually 15 minutes per side, the time being announced through a notice from the Clerk to counsel well before the argument. Additional time may be requested by letter to the clerk or by motion (with an explanation) in complex cases. If several cases concern a common area of civil service law, they may be combined for argument in a single session of the court; this may be requested by counsel representing appellants in related appeals or in appeals raising related issues. The appeals are heard by a panel of three judges, unless, in the exceptional case, counsel requests and the court grants an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> hearing (a truly unusual procedure; according to remarks at a Federal Circuit judicial conference, only about one-half of 1% of the requests for <span class="Italic">en banc</span> consideration are granted). A precedential decision of a panel controls if there is no <span class="Italic">en banc</span> review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LKQ Corp. v. GM Global Tech. Ops., LLC</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP) ("We, as a panel, cannot overrule <span class="Italic">Rosen</span> or <span class="Italic">Durling</span> without a clear directive from the Supreme Court. <span class="Italic">Deckers Corp. v. United States</span>, 752 F.3d 949, 965 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (explaining panels are 'bound by prior panel decisions until they are overruled by the court <span class="Italic">en banc</span> or the Supreme Court'). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">California Inst. Of Tech. v. Broadcom Ltd.</span>, 25 F.4th 976, 990-91 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (explaining the panel only had authority to overrule circuit precedent without <span class="Italic">en banc</span> action given the Supreme Court's reasoning undermining said circuit precedent).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal Circuit panels are prepared for argument and do not learn about the appeal for the first time through oral argument. Counsel are normally cautioned by the judge chairing the panel of three judges hearing argument that the court has read the briefs and is familiar with the facts of the case, meaning that counsel should dispense with factual recitations and get into the issues and legal argument. It is interesting to watch a panel listen to a multimillion dollar patent case with intricate scientific issues and then switch to argument of a civil service appeal. Then there is the case of <span class="Italic">Lucky Litter LLC v. ITC</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 490, 492 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) ("After a cat leaves the box, there is a preset time delay to make sure the cat does not come back into the box with unfinished business"). All seriousness aside, both patent cases and civil service appeals receive attention if they are well briefed and reasonably argued. Chief Judge Michel gave his view of the panel process in <span class="Italic">Past, Present, and Future in the Life of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</span> (American University Law Review [Vol. 59:1199 (2010)] :</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5184"></span>So we are both patent specialists and nonspecialists, just as our court's docket is a mixture of many patent cases interspersed with an even larger number of veterans benefits cases, government personnel cases, tax refund cases, Fifth Amendment Takings Clause cases, government contract cases, international trade cases, and many others. The diversity of backgrounds seems entirely fitting to me, and it has worked well to bring both expertise and much breadth of experience to cases to cases. Thus, a typical panel--they are assembled randomly--will include one or two patent specialists and one or two nonspecialists, just as the appeals argued before that panel on that particular day will include one or two patent cases and two or three nonpatent cases, in addition to several <span class="Italic">pro se</span> cases--often personnel cases--to be decided solely on the basis of the briefs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the court is prepared does not mean that counsel can remain ignorant of the record. Because the court is familiar with the facts, some judges tend to ask for details about the appeal from the bench. An inability to provide those details through record citation can be an embarrassment to counsel and an impediment to an otherwise good argument. Counsel should know the vintage and subsequent judicial acceptance of the precedent relied upon, for the court may have questions on the development of decisions relied on in briefs. A judge is occasionally so inquisitive that argument might better be characterized as answers. Counsel should not view these questions as objectionable intrusions into a well-planned lecture.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On effective appellate advocacy, the author recommends listening to Chief Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, of the Seventh Circuit, who presented the Daniel M Friedman Appellate Advocacy Lecture for the Federal Circuit Bar Association on November 16, 2012, available at <a href="https://fedcirbar.org/Committees/Committee-Information/ArticleID/21/Friedman-Memorial-Committee">fedcirbar.org/Committees/Committee-Information/ArticleID/21/Friedman-Memorial-Committee</a>.

From the Circuit's <span class="Italic">Guidelines</span> we reprint these suggestions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel should not interrupt a judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assume the court is familiar with the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Minimize reading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Have a copy of the appendix and be familiar with the location of items.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assume the court is familiar with the briefs and appendix contents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When raising new authority at argument, provide a copy to opposing counsel ahead of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Stop your argument when your time expires unless the court permits you to continue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Answer questions directly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Avoid pejoratives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When referring to specific portions of the appendix, provided accurate page citations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Do not respond to a question with an unqualified citation to your brief in response to a question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel seated at counsel tables should neither make inappropriate facial gestures nor engage in exaggerated gesticulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From a small group of anonymous advocates come unofficial suggestions to counsel presenting oral argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A week or so before the argument, read the cases cited in the briefs (yours and theirs);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prepare an outline of the argument;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Review the record and annotate your outline of the argument with reference to the significant case documents, with appendix page numbers;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Practice the argument 10-12 times, keeping track of time (recognizing that you will likely reserve a few minutes of time for rebuttal and that there are likely going to be some questions from the judges), revising the argument as you go along;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If you can find someone with patience, have that individual read the briefs and listen to and critique your argument or ask difficult questions during the argument;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At court, when you begin your argument, remember to intone the traditional "may it please the court";</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Do not read your argument;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Speak up, speak distinctly, but do not sound as though you are yelling at the judges;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If there is a major and troublesome issue in your case, acknowledge it early on and address it;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">You may wish to quickly acknowledge strong points briefed by the respondent and address them early on;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Put yourself in the position of the judges on the panel: answer questions directly--do not evade the questioner; avoid promising that you will return to the issue later;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Expect the unexpected, including peculiar hypotheticals;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Avoid the response "But that is not this case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Maintain a conversational tone in argument--it is really a discussion;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Do not talk over a judge who is asking a question or making a comment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Avoid phrases such as and similar to "we submit," "if your honor please"; "it is our position that";</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not too conversational: the judges are not to be referred to as "you guys," or "dudes";</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Know when to sit down--even though the time allotted for argument may be insufficient, or the time allotted may be too much.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because reconsideration and rehearing are rare, the time for proper presentation is in the course of ordinary briefing. The court's Internal Operating Procedures call for circulation of draft panel dispositions to the entire court, "during which time a panel is free to modify, augment, withdraw or, indeed, reverse its tentative judgment and opinion." When the case is circulated, the court may determine that the case should be heard and decided <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, rather than by the assigned panel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. United States</span>, 917 F.2d 529 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Because panel decisions are circulated (other than summary affirmations), major issues requiring rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span> should surface before the panel decision is issued, assuming that the panel decision addresses the issues that counsel think are significant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To emphasize the rarity of successful rehearing petitions, and perhaps to discourage attorneys from unwisely attempting to obtain rehearing, the Federal Circuit created for counsel a capsule summary of its experience with rehearing petitions in question and answer format. The summary no longer appears on the court website:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT PETITIONS FOR REHEARING AND SUGGESTIONS FOR HEARING OR REHEARING <span class="Italic">IN BANC</span> IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When is a petition for rehearing appropriate?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Petitions for rehearing are rarely considered meritorious. Consequently, it is easiest to first answer when a petition for rehearing is not appropriate. A petition for rehearing should not be used to reargue matters already briefed and orally argued. If you failed to persuade the court then, you do not get a second chance. This is especially so when the court has entered a judgment of affirmance without opinion under Fed. Cir. R. 36, as a disposition of this nature is used only when the appellant has utterly failed to raise any issues in the appeal that require an opinion to be written in support of the court's judgment of affirmance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as a usual prerequisite, the court must have filed an opinion in support of its judgment for a petition for rehearing to be appropriate. In addition, counsel seeking rehearing by the panel must be able to identify in the court's opinion a material error of fact or law the correction of which would require a different judgment on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When is a suggestion for rehearing in banc appropriate?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In-banc</span> decisions are extraordinary occurrences. Consequently, to answer this question, one must first understand the respective roles of a three-judge merits panel of the court and the court <span class="Italic">in banc</span>. The responsibility of a merits panel is to decide individual appeals according to the law of the circuit as established in the court's precedential opinions. While each merits panel is empowered to enter precedential opinions, the ultimate responsibility of the court <span class="Italic">in banc</span> is to set forth the law of the circuit which merits panels are obliged to follow.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as a usual prerequisite, a merits panel of the court must have entered a precedential opinion in support of its judgment for a suggestion for rehearing <span class="Italic">in banc</span> to be appropriate. In addition, the party seeking rehearing <span class="Italic">in banc</span> must show that either the merits panel has failed to follow identifiable decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States or precedential opinions of the circuit or the merits panel has followed circuit precedent which the party seeks to have overruled by the court <span class="Italic">in banc</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">How frequently are petitions for rehearing granted by merits panels or suggestions for rehearing in banc accepted by the court in banc?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;The data about petitions for rehearing since 1982 show that merits panels granted some relief in only 4 percent of the more than 1800 petitions filed. The relief granted usually involved only minor corrections of factual misstatements, rarely resulting in a change of outcome in the decision. <span class="Italic">In-banc</span> suggestions were accepted less frequently, only 15 of 1000 times.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Historically, the court itself initiated <span class="Italic">in-banc</span> review in more than half (19 of 34) of the very few appeals decided <span class="Italic">in banc</span> since 1982. This <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, <span class="Italic">in banc</span> review is a by-product of the court's practice of circulating every precedential panel decision to all of the judges before it is published. No count is kept of <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, <span class="Italic">in banc</span> polls that fail to carry, but one of the reasons that virtually all of the more than 1000 suggestions made by the parties since 1982 have been declined is that the court itself has already impliedly "cleared" the precedential opinions before they are filed by merits panels.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5185"></span>Q.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Is it necessary to have filed either a petition for rehearing or a suggestion for rehearing in banc before filing a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;No. All that is needed is a final judgment in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a matter of interest, very few petitions for <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> from Federal Circuit decisions are granted. Since 1982, the Supreme Court has granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in only 34 appeals heard in the Federal Circuit. More than 900 petitions for <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> have been filed in that period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Information on rehearing and rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span> at the Federal Circuit is on its website. <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/home/case-information/case-filings/petitions-for-rehearing-rehearing-en-banc/">https://cafc.uscourts.gov/home/case-information/case-filings/petitions-for-rehearing-rehearing-en-banc/</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it may be rare for the court to grant a rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc,</span> the process is significant and is probably best employed when there is a clear conflict between decisions of panels of the court. Judge Newman pointed out the need for rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span> when there is a question concerning uniformity within a national system of laws (an example being the Civil Service Reform Act--albeit not the example in the appeal before Judge Newman), in <span class="Italic">Pfizer Inc. v. Apotex, Inc.</span>, 488 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Stability of precedent and the uniform application of correct law to achieve the correct result are the assignment of the Federal Circuit, for our rulings are of nation-wide effect. A primary purpose for which our court was formed was to provide the judicial stability that supports commercial investment--this was a unique judicial role, and was adopted in recognition of the dependence of technology-based industry on an effective patent system. It was recognized that a nationally uniform, consistent, and correct patent law is an essential foundation of technological innovation, which is today the dominant contributor to the nation's economy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">En banc</span> consideration may be sought to overrule a precedential decision, since one panel cannot overrule the decision of a prior panel on a point of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">MacLean v. DHS</span>, 754 Fed. Appx. 950, 954 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP) ("This panel, however, does not have the authority to grant Mr. MacLean the relief that he desires. A panel cannot simply overrule its precedent. <span class="Italic">George E. Warren Corp. v. United States</span>, 341 F.3d 1348, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2003). To overrule a precedent, the court must rule <span class="Italic">en banc</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>."). <span class="Italic">Fall Line Patents, LLC v. Unified Patents, LLC</span> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200728138">No. 2019-1956</a>), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"In this Circuit, a later panel is bound by the determinations of a prior panel, unless relieved of that obligation by an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> order of the court or a decision of the Supreme Court." <span class="Italic">Deckers Corp. v. United States</span>, 752 F.3d 949, 959 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Of course, we should not follow our precedent blindly. <span class="Italic">See Ramos v. Louisiana</span>, 140 S. Ct. 1390, 1405 (2020) ("[<span class="Italic">S</span>]<span class="Italic">tare decisis</span> has never been treated as 'an inexorable command.'"). "Indeed, we have said that it is the province and obligation of the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court to review the current validity of challenged prior decisions." <span class="Italic">Lighting Ballast Control LLC v. Philips Elecs. N. Am. Corp</span>., 744 F.3d 1272, 1298 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (O'Malley, J., dissenting) (internal quotations marks omitted). But we do not overturn our decisions lightly, particularly those that we so recently issued. We recognize that "today's legal issues are often not so different from the questions of yesterday and that we are not the first ones to try to answer them." <span class="Italic">June Med. Servs., LLC v. Russo</span>, 140 S. Ct. 2103, 2134 (2020) (Roberts, C.J., concurring).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Counsel may submit appeals on the briefs rather than argue them, and many cases are decided on submission. If cases are argued (and if they are not), counsel must treat the record fairly and avoid misrepresentation of the facts of record. The author recalls watching a lawyer tell the court that an objection had been made during the course of the proceedings below. Respondent's counsel said it had not been made. The judge chairing the panel halted the argument of respondent's counsel, asked the petitioner's counsel to step to the podium and explain where the record demonstrated the objection he referenced was made. In another argument, a patent case, counsel was asked by a judge whether a drawing that appeared in a brief was in the record. It was not, and the judge explained that because the lawyer had not mentioned the source of the drawing in his brief, the judge wasted time looking for it in the record. Other lawyers have suffered the embarrassment of being told that their statements in briefs were not supported by the record. Then there is the lawyer whose argument is painfully prefaced by a statement to the court that there is an error in the organization or typing of the brief. This is not the way to win favor from the bench. These incidents are not of great judicial moment, but they disrupt the momentum of an oral argument, they impair the reputation of counsel, and do his client's cause no credit. The best way to ensure fidelity to the record is for the lawyer who presents argument to write his own brief and carefully study the record, especially the contents of the appendix.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of representations in the appeals court, counsel (those who read nonprecedential decisions) were cautioned, <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 83-1333):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An attorney has a duty to the court not to present arguments that he or she knows or should know are based upon incorrect facts. A corollary is that the attorney must ascertain that any facts he or she relies upon are correct.... &#8197;Here the attorney did not make the necessary inquiry but instead presented a legal argument based upon a factual assumption that has now proven incorrect. We cannot condone that practice. To the contrary, we think that the attorney failed to meet the high standards we expect and demand of those who practice before us. This unfortunate incident also underscores the importance and wisdom of the principle that appellate review is to be based upon the record before the appellate court and that counsel should not attempt to argue a case on the basis of facts not in the record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The point was again made in <span class="Italic">Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co.</span>, 797 F.2d 1564, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notion that counsel may strenuously and repeatedly emphasize a fact contrary to the record, may consider that conduct mere "error," and may still consider his preparation "diligent," is anathema to the proper, fair, and expeditious administration of appellate justice. That conduct constitutes a dereliction of duty owed the court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of high standards, the court is interested in counsel's arguments but has little patience for invective, observing in, of all arenas, a patent case, <span class="Italic">Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co.</span>, 797 F.2d at 1568 n.5:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel on appeal have each engaged in lamentable attribution of ulterior motives to the other. Having unprofessionally charged unprofessionalism, each then cites that charge as warranting an award of costs and attorney fees. Pointing to misstatements of the record is appropriate. Motivational analysis is not. Nor will the latter prejudice the court. Judges have much and many better things to do than to referee irrelevant cat-fights of counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">First on an annual, then on a sporadic basis, the Federal Circuit hosted and hosts a judicial conference in Washington, an event well attended, at least by patent lawyers. Some proceedings, including those of the MSPB breakout sessions, are transcribed and reported in the Federal Rules Decisions. For those interested in reports of the proceedings, the publication list for each reported conference follows:</p>
