<p class="noindent">Management should have provided to the union portions of an Inspector <span id="Page_337"></span>General's report that commented on working conditions in response to a request the union made to assist in negotiations and to ensure that management adhered to provisions of the existing agreement. It was immaterial that negotiations were not ongoing; the information could be requested in preparation for negotiations. <span class="Italic">DMA and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 24 FLRA 154, 168-69 (1986) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, Minot AFB and NFFE Local 1041</span>, 42 FLRA 235, 249 (1991) (ALJ Decision) (union was entitled to unredacted Unit Effectiveness Inspection evaluating administrative and management procedures when that report could be used to assist employee who challenged removal based on unacceptable performance). Management was required to bargain over a proposal that the union be provided copies of reviews and evaluations conducted by an accreditation organization to the extent the material impacted on unit members. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 547-48 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 and Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, </span>49 FLRA 470, 479 (1994) (approving as negotiable Proposal 2, demanding release to the union of general information concerning the activity security system that does not relate to internal security investigations or to any evaluation of the effectiveness of system). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-199.html#sec8-199">Questioning by Inspectors General and Agency Criminal Investigative Units; Executive Order 12171</a>," and <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1979 (1999), as to relation between agencies and their inspectors general.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Under more recent decisions, some internal evaluative material will not be ordered disclosed unless the union demonstrates a particularized need for it. Following <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (discussed, <span class="Italic">post</span>, as to disclosure of internal agency information), an agency internal safety audit conducted by the agency IG constituted "guidance, advice and counsel for management officials," disclosable only on a showing of a particularized need, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force and AFGE</span>, 49 FLRA 603, 607-09 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Park Service, National Capital Region</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Park Police</span>, 48 FLRA 1151 (1993) (Member Talkin concurring in part and dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">National Park</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>), the majority of the Authority addressed the standard to be applied to determine whether certain documents are necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4). In particular, the Authority adopted the court's decision in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, and stated, as relevant here, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]n agency is not obligated to provide a union with requested documents containing advice, guidance, counsel, or training materials provided for management officials under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute unless the union demonstrates a particularized need, as set forth by the court [in <span class="Italic">NLRB </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>], for such information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, 48 FLRA at 1160. The Authority noted that the court in <span class="Italic">NLRB </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span> set forth two examples of instances where a union could establish a particularized need for advice, guidance, counsel, or training provided for management officials. In particular, the court stated that a union might establish such a need "where the union has a grievable complaint covering the information." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 532 (emphasis omitted). As an example of such a demonstration, the court posited a situation where a statute or a bargaining agreement "may impose a duty on the agency regarding predecisional deliberation, and the duty may then ground a grievable claim of right in the employee or union." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 532-33. The court also stated that particularized need for information could be established "when the disputed document creates a grievable action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 533.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear and undisputed that both requested IG Reports constitute managerial guidance, advice, and counsel. In this regard, the reports were created at the request of management officials for use by management officials in making decisions regarding safety processes in five Air Logistics Centers, and in assessing whether previous recommendations for improvement by the IG have been carried out. The reports contain not only an assessment of current safety operations but also opinions and recommendations to management for correcting deficiencies and making improvements in such operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the requested IG Reports constitute guidance, advice and counsel for management officials, it is necessary, consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, to determine whether the Union has established a particularized need for the reports. In this regard, at the time of the Judge's decision and the exceptions in this case, the Authority had not adopted <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, and there was no other basis on which the parties should have concluded that it was necessary to establish a particularized need, as discussed in <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, for the requested information. Further, the Judge did not determine whether such need had been established for the IG Report and, although he cited <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span> in determining that the Union did not establish such need for the Follow-Up IG Report, the Judge did not discuss or address whether this case encompassed either of the two examples of particularized need set forth in that opinion and discussed in <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the complaints in Case Nos. CH-CA-20193 and CH-CA-20459 must be remanded to the Judge for further proceedings. On remand, absent settlement, the Judge should provide an opportunity to the parties to address whether the Union established a particularized need for either or both of the requested IG Reports. In this regard, we do not address what circumstances, in addition to the two examples set forth by the court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, may establish such need....</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand, the union still did not obtain the information. The requisite demonstration of a particularized need for the intramanagement recommendations contained in the IG report was not made. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force and AFGE</span>, 52 FLRA 1000, 1008-09 (1997), explained that "[t]he union is required to articulate its disclosure interests at or near the time of the request--not for the first time at the unfair labor practice hearing," and:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's request stated that the Follow-Up IG Report was necessary to assist in developing proposals for contract negotiations and to "determine whether any employee or Union rights have been violated and if they have, so the Union can take appropriate remedial action through our negotiated grievance procedures." In reply, the Respondent asserted that the Union had not established a particularized need for the Follow-Up IG Report because, among other things, the Union had not "identified which portion of the MLA this relates to, nor...identified how the report relates to a potential grievance by an employee or the union."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's reply explained its reasons for concluding that the request did not adequately explain the Union's need for the report. The Respondent's reply did not expressly request "clarification" from the Union. However, to find that it did not at least implicitly invite further discussion of the Union's asserted need would elevate form over substance. The Union did not respond to the Respondent and, instead, filed the second ULP charge in this case less than 2 weeks after receiving the agency's response. Given this response, we analyze this complaint in a manner similar to our analysis of the complaint regarding the IG Report, and consistent with the analyses in other cases where a union provided no further explanation of its need for requested information despite specific matters raised in an agency's reply<span class="Italic">. E.g., IRS, Oklahoma City</span> [51 FLRA 1391]. That is, we limit our examination to the Union's initial information request to determine whether it established particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its request, the Union asserted two needs for the Follow-Up IG Report: to determine whether any employee or Union rights had been violated, and to assist in developing proposals for MLA negotiations. With respect to the first--the asserted need to determine whether employee or Union rights had been violated--the request did not address which statutory or contractual rights might be implicated by the report, and the Union provided no clarification after the Respondent questioned how the report related to a potential grievance. With respect to the second--the Union's asserted need to develop bargaining proposals--preparing proposals for collective bargaining is without doubt a central Union representational responsibility under the Statute, and the importance of health and safety issues, in general, is evident. However, an assertion that requested information is necessary to "assist in developing proposals for MLA negotiations," is similar to the conclusory or bare assertions previously found by the Authority to be insufficient to establish particularized need. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., INS, Twin Cities</span>, 51 FLRA at 1480-82 (union stated that it needed exhibits to inspector general reports and related materials "to properly respond to the allegations" in notice of employee's proposed removal); <span class="Italic">IRS, Oklahoma City</span>, 51 FLRA at 1392 (union asserted that employees' performance appraisals were "necessary in order to support [its] allegations" that grievant's lowered appraisal constituted discrimination based on sex). Particularly in circumstances where the agency questions the assertion, such a conclusory assertion is at odds with the concept of particularized need. In this case, the Union did not explain how the reports would assist in developing its bargaining proposals. Accordingly, application of Authority precedent leads to the conclusion that this asserted need also falls short of the specificity required under <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's failure to articulate its need for the Follow-Up IG Report with the requisite specificity precluded the Respondent from making an informed judgment about whether the Follow-Up Report was "necessary," and from considering ways to accommodate the Union's interest in the information or attempting to reach agreement on the extent to which the requested information could be disclosed. <span class="Italic">IRS, Oklahoma City</span>, 51 FLRA at 1396. Accordingly, we find that the Union did not satisfy its burden of articulating and establishing with the required specificity why it needed the Follow-Up IG Report.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to investigative materials compiled prior to interviews of agency employees suspected of misconduct, there was no ULP when the employer refused to provide the information in <span class="Italic">FAA, New England Region and NAATS</span>, 35 FLRA 645, 650-54 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, an exclusive representative's function of representing an employee to be examined in connection with an investigation under section 7114(a)(2)(B) is as much a representational function under the Statute as are the representative's activities in negotiating and administering the collective bargaining agreement and determining whether to file an unfair labor practice charge....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_338"></span>The right to representation at an examination is designed to protect employees during meetings with their employers in connection with an investigation that the employee reasonably believes may result in disciplinary action....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The union representative must be granted a full opportunity to assist the examined employee and to fully participate in the investigative examination....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Inasmuch as effective representation...would be difficult...in the absence of necessary information, we conclude that information requested in connection with a union's representation of an employee...is relevant to the representational function....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question we must decide is what constitutes information that is "necessary" for a union to effectively represent an employee in an investigatory examination....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[U]nder <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, an employer has a legitimate interest and prerogative in achieving the objective of the examination and preserving the integrity of the investigation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In construing the NLRA...the NLRB has held that in order for the representation to be effective, the employee and the union representative are entitled to consult before the interview and to be informed of the nature of the prospective interview. <span class="Italic">Pacific Telephone &#x0026; Telegraph Co.</span>, 262 NLRB 1048 (1982)....&#8197;The NLRB noted that the requirement to inform the employee and the union representative of the subject matter of the interview "does not dictate anything resembling 'discovery.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The NLRB defined the obligation of the employer as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The employer does not have to reveal its case, the information it has obtained, or even the specifics of the misconduct to be discussed. A <span class="Italic">general</span> statement as to the <span class="Italic">subject matter</span> of the interview, which identifies to the employee and his representative the misconduct for which discipline may be imposed, will suffice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the NLRB's approach and adopt it for the Federal sector as an analytical tool....&#8197;Consequently, we find that the right of a union, under the Statute, to obtain relevant information for an investigatory examination must be balanced against the interests of an agency employer in investigating and disciplining misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We agree with the NLRB that the representational rights at the investigatory examinations do not include the right to have the employer "reveal its case" or "the information [the employer] has obtained" and do not "dictate anything resembling 'discovery.'"...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that after the Respondent proposed discipline against the unit employees who were represented by the Union, the Respondent furnished the Union with all of the requested information. The Union was, therefore, furnished with the information after the Respondent's investigation was complete and the parties' dispute became "adversarial."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But Dept. of Labor, Office of the Ass't Sec'y for Admin. and Mgmt. and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 26 FLRA 943, 951-53 (1987), directed the agency to produce tapes and witness statements of individuals interviewed by the employer concerning a proposed suspension that the union was evaluating in the course of its representation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 552a(k)(2)...permits an agency to exempt from disclosure investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes....&#8197;The Respondent has not established that the material was compiled for law enforcement purposes....&#8197;Rather,...the information was collected in an employee conduct investigation....&#8197;The investigation was not directly focused on alleged illegal acts which could, if proved, result in civil or criminal sanctions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly...[s]ection 552(b)(7) of the FOIA exempts from disclosure "investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes."...&#8197;As we found above, the Respondent fails to establish that the information was compiled for law enforcement purposes. Moreover...the Freedom of Information Act does not prohibit release of data within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)...<span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span>, 26 FLRA No. 52 (1987)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise...Respondent has failed to establish that disclosure of the information to the Union would interfere with Respondent's right under section 7106(a)(1)...to determine its internal security practices....&#8197;[T]he interviews were not given under any pledge of confidentiality and there is no question of impeding any on-going investigation of the employee's alleged misconduct since the investigation was completed and the employee suspended for the alleged wrongdoing. Moreover, information compiled in connection with the exercise of management actions under section 7106 of the Statute is not necessarily prohibited by law from disclosure under section 7114(b)(4) and a union's right to negotiate for disclosure of information under section 7117 is not coextensive with an agency's obligation to furnish information under section 7114(b)(4). <span class="Italic">National Park Service, National Capital Region, United States Park Police</span>, 26 FLRA No. 53 (1987)....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Warren AFB and AFGE Local 2354</span>, 44 FLRA 452, 457 n.3 (1992), considered whether a balancing test should be applied to a request for information from a confidential source that was "compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation" within the meaning of the second clause of FOIA exemption 7(D). Relying on circuit court opinions, FLRA decided against the use of a balancing test. Instead, it determined that once it has been determined that the requested information was procured from a confidential source and was part of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, all of the information is exempt from disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union could not compel the agency to negotiate on a proposal requiring the agency to allow the union copies of agency working files containing confidential information. The union desired the files to facilitate grievance processing. Although the agency must provide information requested in individual cases not exempt from disclosure by law, the union proposal was nonnegotiable because it limited that agency in determining its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">NLRB Union and Gen.
