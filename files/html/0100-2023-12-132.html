<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-131"><span class="space">e.</span> Issue of Timeliness of Appeal or Other Submission</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerns about the timeliness of submissions may arise when a pleading or appeal is not filed on time and the filing party seeks to justify the timeliness of the submission on PFR or reopening request. Timeliness may also be at issue when a party seeks to submit with a PFR or reopening request material that arguably should have first been presented to the AJ.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence concerning the timeliness of an appeal is new if it could not have been submitted to the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Dept. of Army</span>, 15 MSPR 720, 721 (1983) (untimeliness of an appeal was not excused if evidence of improper directions concerning its filing was not first presented to the AJ). The Board can bend its rules slightly to permit the introduction of evidence that is not new but that bears on the timeliness of an appeal. In <span class="Italic">Elza v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 33, 35 (1989), the appellant maintained that his union timely filed an appeal, but he was unable to obtain evidence of the filing, within the control of his union, until after the record closed on the jurisdictional issue. Although the Board could have faulted the appellant for failing to invoke formal discovery procedures to obtain the information from his union, the Board accepted the evidence offered with the PFR demonstrating an attempt by the union to file the appeal and remanded the appeal for further analysis of its timeliness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cloutier v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 411, 415 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (accepting late evidence concerning the agency's disposition of an EEO complaint that directly related to the initial dismissal of the appellant's appeal as premature).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 213, 215 (1994), accepted belated evidence concerning the mailing date of an appeal with the explanation that "we find that the appellant has established that the affidavit was 'unavailable' before the record closed because the administrative judge failed to inform him that his response regarding the timeliness of his petition for appeal must be in affidavit form." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Staats v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 65, 68-69 n.* (1995) (under somewhat analogous circumstances, the Board accepted evidence on the timeliness of the appeal when the evidence, produced with a PFR, was developed during discovery but not presented at the regional level prior to the issuance of the PFR: "[B]ecause the administrative judge decided this case without a hearing, the parties did not have the opportunity to file prehearing submissions, including proposed hearing exhibits such as excerpts of discovery materials. Furthermore, the agency was in possession of the statements that the appellant refers to on review, since they were made in response to the agency's own interrogatories."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Staats v. USPS</span>,68 MSPR 65, 68-69 n.* (1995) ("The responses to interrogatories as well as other material produced in discovery were not submitted as part of the record below, in accordance with the preferred practice of the Board's administrative judges. Nevertheless, we have considered the statements produced in discovery that the parties have submitted on review. The statements have been verified by the party making them, and they are material to the timeliness question that is at issue on review. In addition, because the administrative judge decided this case without a hearing, the parties did not have the opportunity to file prehearing submissions, including proposed hearing exhibits such as excerpts of discovery materials. Furthermore, the agency was in possession of the statements that the appellant refers to on review, since they were made in response to the agency's own interrogatories."); <span class="Italic">Perkins v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 425, 429-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2003) (evidence of timeliness of the appeal was accepted for the first time with a PFR when the acknowledgment order, generally raising an issue of timeliness, was not received until after the initial decision was issued). The Federal Circuit determined evidence to be new, and therefore evidence that should have been considered with a PFR, that tended to demonstrate that the representative who handled the initial Board appeal misrepresented his efforts in timely filing an appeal. The evidence concerning the initial representative's conduct of the case was not developed until the appeal was dismissed as untimely. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coakley v. MSPB,</span> 136 Fed. Appx. 370, 375 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board will consider evidence submitted for the first time on PFR that was available before the record closed below when the party was not put on notice of the nature of a dispositive issue until the issuance of the initial decision." <span class="Italic">Bell v. DHS</span>, 95 MSPR 580, 584 &#x00B6; 11 (2004) (timeliness of appeal: considering evidence from the appellant concerning the status of an EEO complaint); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 550, 554 &#x00B6; 9, 2009 MSPB 22 (2009) (appellant could submit evidence with his PFR when the agency raised an evidentiary issue in its final submission on the day the record closed). In <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 28, 32 (1994), the question was whether the appeal was timely filed. At issue was the date of mailing of the appeal. The appellant submitted with her PFR a certified mail receipt that preceded by a day the meter mark on the envelope carrying the appeal to the Board. The Board excused the belated submission of the evidence because it was the AJ's duty to explain to the appellant that the postmark date of her submission was at issue. Because the appellant first learned of the issue following receipt of the initial decision, her evidence responsive to that issue was properly submitted with the PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manker v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 405, 410 &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (the same approach in an enforced leave case: the Board considered evidence submitted with the PFR when the AJ failed to inform the appellant of the governing burden of proof); <span class="Italic">Anthony v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 45, 51 (1997) (similarly, in an enforcement proceeding: "[W]here the administrative judge did not provide the appellant with sufficient notice that he must address an issue or of the required burden of proof, the Board has considered such newly-submitted evidence and newly-raised arguments on the basis that they were previously unavailable."); <span class="Italic">Williams v. VA</span>, 74 MSPR 472, 474-75 (1997) (the same approach to a counsel fee petition rejected as untimely because of a postal delivery problem that was not brought to the appellant's attention either by the AJ or by an agency motion to dismiss the petition); <span class="Italic">Shivaee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 383, 386 (1997) (considering evidence initially submitted with a PFR that was available before the record closing when the party was not notified of the nature of a dispositive issue until the issuance of the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board permitted evidence to be presented with a PFR by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who was not informed of the importance of the information in the AJ's acknowledgment order raising a timeliness issue and when the AJ did not provide the appellant a chance to supply the information by way of reply to an agency submission prior to the close of the record at the regional level, <span class="Italic">Saturley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 522, 526 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, based on the circumstances of this case, due diligence does not require that the evidence in question should have been produced before the record closed. The Acknowledgment Order issued by the administrative judge raised the timeliness issue, and gave the appellant 15 days to respond and the agency 10 days to reply to the appellant's submission on timeliness, at which time the record on the issue would close. Nothing in the Order, however, suggested that the appellant could respond to the agency's submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While these newly-submitted statements would not normally be considered because they were filed for the first time with the petition for review, we find that they may properly be viewed as previously unavailable. As in <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 213, 215 (1994), the administrative judge's Acknowledgment Order provided no guidance as to what proved to be a crucial issue in the appeal. Here the agency raised the issues of the appellant's ability to drive and her failure to complain about the medication in its response to the administrative judge's order on timeliness. That order provided no indication that she could reply to the agency's response. Accordingly, we find that it is appropriate to consider the documents submitted with the appellant's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McIver v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 103, 106-07 (1996), justified consideration at the PFR level of medical evidence concerning the appellant's ability to meet an appeal deadline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that this letter does not constitute "new" evidence under the Board's regulations because the appellant might have secured it prior to the close of the record. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(d)(1); <span class="Italic">Avansino v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPB 308, 3 MSPR 211, 214 (1980). However, under the circumstances of this case, and for the reasons set forth below, we have determined to consider it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, while the Board's acknowledgment order properly advised the appellant that he had the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness and ordered him to file evidence and argument showing that his appeal was timely or that good cause existed for the delay, the order did not apprise him that, to establish good cause for his untimely appeal on the basis of mental incapacity, he had to submit corroborating medical evidence, and explain how his condition prevented him from timely filing his appeal. Thus, the appellant was not on notice of what was required to either establish timeliness or warrant waiver of the time limit for filing. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 28, 32 (1994). It appears that, by submitting the July 6, 1995, letter, he was attempting to clarify what was said below, once he understood what the issue was. Accordingly, it would not be in the interest of justice to dismiss the appellant's appeal as untimely filed without allowing him to submit relevant evidence with his petition for review, once he was put on notice by the initial decision of what the administrative judge considered to be the dispositive timeliness issue<span class="Italic">. Id.; cf. Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board must provide the appellant a fair opportunity to make the required jurisdictional showing before dismissing his appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consideration of the July 6, 1995, letter is further warranted in this case because of the evidence that was submitted in the proceeding before the administrative judge stating that the appellant currently suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition that may have added to his confusion as to what was required of him in connection with the processing of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span> before the Board. His <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status is a significant factor in our decision to remand this case for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 580, 584 (1995); <span class="Italic">Neal v. Dept. of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 26, 30 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that the July 6, 1995, submission, considered in conjunction with the consistent evidence submitted below, raises the <span id="Page_1718"></span>issue of the appellant's incapacity to meet filing deadlines, warranting further adjudication on the issue of timeliness. Accordingly, we find it appropriate to remand this case to the regional office. On remand, the administrative judge shall afford the appellant the opportunity to submit additional evidence on the specific issue of his mental incapacity to timely file an appeal from OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board excused an appellant's belated submission of evidence of a timely appeal in <span class="Italic">Felder v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 312, 313-14 (1995), when the agency could or should have rectified the problem while the appeal was pending before the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the acknowledgment order, the administrative judge informed the appellant that his appeal appeared to have been untimely filed, and ordered the appellant to file evidence and argument that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause exists for the delay. Shortly thereafter, the agency submitted a response to the appeal, stating that the appellant's removal was effective on November 26, 1993, and moving that the appeal be dismissed as untimely filed. The appellant did not respond to either the acknowledgment order or the motion to dismiss. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely, finding that it was filed more than a year after the removal was effective, and that the appellant had not shown good cause for the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that his appeal was untimely filed. Attached to his petition is a copy of the December 23, 1994, final agency decision on his equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1) (1995), if an appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination regarding a matter otherwise appealable to the Board, a Board appeal is timely if filed within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency's final decision on the discrimination issue. Here, the agency issued a final decision on the merits of the appellant's EEO complaint on December 23, 1994, and the appellant filed his Board appeal on January 16, 1995. Regardless of the date that the appellant received the final agency decision, therefore, his Board appeal was timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party may be subject to sanctions for failing to respond to an administrative judge's order, including being prohibited from introducing evidence concerning the information sought.... Thus, the appellant should have timely responded to the show cause order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the petition for appeal was timely on its face, however, we find that the appellant's failure to respond does not bar adjudication of its merits. In the appeal, the appellant stated that he was seeking Board review of a final agency EEO decision and predicated jurisdiction on the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Moreover, the agency had full knowledge of the appeal's timeliness, because it was aware of its own final EEO decision, and knew that the appellant's time limit for filing ran from receipt of that decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marjie v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 95, 99-100 (1996), employed analysis similar to <span class="Italic">Felder</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges on review that his petition for appeal was timely filed because he did not receive the final agency decision on his discrimination complaint until August 3, 1995. In support of this allegation, he has submitted a copy of the envelope that contained the final agency decision, which the agency sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. The article number on the envelope matches the number set forth on the first page of the final agency decision; notations on the envelope show attempted delivery on "7/21" and "7/26," and show receipt on "8-3-95."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board normally will not consider evidence submitted for the first time with a petition for review absent a showing that the evidence was unavailable before the record closed below despite the filing party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115; <span class="Italic">Avansino v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPB 308, 3 MSPR 211, 214 (1980). As explained below, however, we find it appropriate to consider the appellant's newly-submitted evidence on timeliness, based on the recent decision of <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, the appellant filed a formal complaint of discrimination contesting her removal, and filed a Board appeal 53 days after the date of issuance of the final agency decision on the complaint. The administrative judge, after soliciting evidence from the appellant on the date she mailed her appeal, dismissed the appeal as untimely filed, based on the presumption that she received the final agency decision five days after it was issued. <span class="Italic">See</span> 75 F.3d at 641-42. The appellant submitted evidence with her petition for review showing that she actually received the final agency decision one month after the administrative judge had presumed she received it, and that her appeal was filed within the applicable time limit following such receipt. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 642. The full Board nonetheless denied her petition for review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the court reversed the final Board decision, concluding that the appellant was denied a "full and fair opportunity to litigate the [timeliness] issue." <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d at 645. Specifically, the court held that the administrative judge should have advised the appellant, prior to dismissal, of the date that he would presume she had received the final agency decision in the absence of evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 646-47. The court also noted that the agency did not submit any evidence of the date the appellant received its final decision, and held that the administrative judge should have ordered both parties to submit whatever evidence they had concerning the date of receipt. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 646-47 ("we reject the [agency's] argument that it had no obligation to come forward with relevant evidence [on timeliness] in its possession"). In light of these deficiencies in the administrative judge's treatment of the timeliness issue, the court considered the appellant's evidence of the date she received the final agency decision, and found that the appeal had been timely filed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 647.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, the administrative judge did not advise the appellant, prior to dismissal, that he would presume that the appellant received the final agency decision five days after it was issued in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Furthermore, as in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, the agency did not come forward with evidence showing the date of receipt, nor was it asked to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant did not have an opportunity to make a meaningful response to the agency's motion to dismiss, we find it appropriate to consider his evidence on timeliness submitted for the first time on review. Based on that evidence, which is uncontroverted, we find that he received the final agency decision on August 3, 1995. His petition for appeal, filed on September 2, 1995, was timely under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1). The portion of the initial decision that concluded that the appeal was untimely filed is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 671, 675 &#x00B6; 11 (2002) (accepting evidence with a PFR, bearing on the timeliness of the appeal, withheld by the agency during adjudication by the AJ; the agency may not conceal evidence that would change the case result).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding decisions that permit new evidence involving the timing of an appeal, the usual rule, expressed in <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 118, 122 (1992), is that the Board will not consider for the first time on PFR argument not presented to the AJ on the issue of timeliness.</p>
