<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-54"><span class="space">11.</span> MSPB Processing</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The initial decision becomes a final decision if no one files a PFR (or if the Board does not reopen on its own motion) within 35 days after its issuance. 5 CFR <span id="Page_1639"></span>1201.113 (2022); 5 USC 7701(e). The filing of a PFR suspends the finality of the initial decision: no one wins or loses until the Board issues a final decision. A single member of the Board may grant a PFR or otherwise direct Board review pursuant to 5 USC 7701(e)(1) unless, as to a decision by an administrative law judge, the law requires the full Board to grant review. <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 35 MSPR 381, 384 n.1 (1987). In practice PFRs result in decisions. There is not a two-step process involving the granting of a PFR followed by a later decision on the petition. A party briefs the case but once--in the PFR (or in opposition to the PFR). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Maxfield v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 13 MSPR 28, 29-30 (1982). If the Board wants further briefing, an unusual event, it notifies the parties or publishes a Federal Register request for submission of <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs. The Board does not have a procedure in its rules for an accelerated or expedited PFR process. <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State</span>, 112 MSPR 587, 591 &#x00B6; 6, 2009 MSPB 218 (2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Extensions of time to file the PFR, cross-petition, or response to either, may be obtained under 5 CFR 1201.114(f) (2022), involving a request directed to the Board's Clerk. The Clerk is liberal in granting extensions of reasonable length, for a stated reason--if the extension request is filed before the PFR deadline. A good reason for an extension would be the agency's failure to receive the appellant's PFR after the agency receives the Board's notice acknowledging receipt of the PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 16, 18 n.2 (1999). But there is no list of reasons for requesting extensions. The request is based on the circumstances confronting the prospective petitioner. After the issuance of an initial decision, an AJ does not retain jurisdiction over a case for the purpose of granting an extension of the time for filing a PFR. <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 60 MSPR 5, 7 n.* (1993). Late pleadings are treated under 5 CFR 1201.114(g) (2022). If additional time is needed for a filing, request an extension before the deadline--a much better course than a late filing that must be justified under a discretionary "good cause" standard. The Board rejects a lot of PFRs as untimely filed. Be sure to comply with 5 CFR 1201.114(f) (2022): "A motion for an extension must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Separate sections of Board regulations govern extensions of time to file PFRs prior to the deadline for filing and waiver of the timeliness rule for belated filings, 5 CFR 1201.114 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Extension of time to file</span>. The Board will grant a motion for extension of time to file a pleading described in paragraph (a) only if the party submitting the motion shows good cause. Motions for extensions must be filed with the Clerk of the Board on or before the date on which the petition or other pleading is due. The Board, in its discretion, may grant or deny those motions without providing the other parties the opportunity to comment on them. A motion for an extension must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746. (See Appendix IV.) The affidavit or sworn statement must include a specific and detailed description of the circumstances alleged to constitute good cause, and it should be accompanied by any available documentation or other evidence supporting the matters asserted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Late filings</span>. Any pleading described in paragraph (a) that is filed late must be accompanied by a motion that shows good cause for the untimely filing, unless the Board has specifically granted an extension of time under paragraph (f) of this section, or unless a motion for extension is pending before the Board. The motion must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746. (See Appendix IV.) The affidavit or sworn statement must include: the reasons for failing to request an extension before the deadline for the submission; and a specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing, accompanied by supporting documentation or other evidence. Any response to the motion may be included in the response to the petition for review, the cross petition for review, or the response to the cross petition for review. The response will not extend the time provided by paragraph (e) of this section to file a cross petition for review or to respond to the petition or cross petition. In the absence of a motion, the Board may, in its discretion, determine on the basis of the existing record whether there was good cause for the untimely filing, or it may provide the party that submitted the document with an opportunity to show why it should not be dismissed or excluded as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may join or consolidate PFRs involving the same parties to different regional adjudications to expedite adjudication of the cases if neither party will be adversely affected. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Storm v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 14, 19 (1994); <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 72, 73 (1990) (joining two appeals involving PFRs of two initial decisions dismissing the appeals); <span class="Italic">Arndt v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 221, 221 n.1 (1983) (consolidating a group of PFRs that raised the same issues, allegations, were nearly identical, and that arose from a group of consolidated appeals). The Board may decline to consolidate PFRs in related cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bryant v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 473, 473 n.* (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A request to reopen an appeal filed with the AJ who issued what became a final decision should be forwarded by the AJ to the Board for consideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">New v. VA</span>, 72 MSPR 574, 584 (1996); <span class="Italic">Moriarty v. Rhode Island Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 56 MSPR 144, 147 (1992) ("judges do not have the authority to reopen appeals in which there has been a final Board decision"). The Clerk of the Board occasionally characterizes these requests filed by appellants and agencies as PFRs under 5 CFR 1201.114 (2022) and, if the PFR would be late, requests the party to explain the filing delay. <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 180, 180 n.1 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Biddle v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 270, 272 (1995) (if an appellant characterizes his request as one to reopen the appeal, the Board may recharacterize the pleading as a PFR if the appellant seeks to challenge the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What does a PFR look like? Format will be discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-12-202.html#sec5-201">Format and Substance of PFR; Reply; Response to Reply</a>." For now it is sufficient to observe that it may be a letter to the Board (or Clerk of the Board) stating why the initial decision is wrong. It may be an elaborate legal brief, replete with citations to both legal decisions and materials in the record. Whether the PFR is a letter, a memo, a legal brief, or a document bound in ribbons and suitable for framing, its purpose is to succinctly demonstrate to an anonymous attorney in the Board's Office of Appeals Counsel (and to the legal advisors to the Board members and to those members) the facts of the appeal, the analysis used by the AJ in reaching the result obtained in the initial decision, and the factual or legal errors of the decision. Although the petition should be succinct, it should be specific as to factual and legal errors. The petition is meant to persuade, but it must also be accurate. Because the Board's reviewing attorneys will have the record of the case, it is not necessary to attach materials from the record to the petition; although it may be useful to attach a critical document. There are regulatory limits, subsequently discussed, on the size of the PFR and response.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A quick statistical computation suggests that the Board issues at least several decisions per working day--a pattern interrupted after January of 2017 when the Board lost its quorum. (restored in March 2022). It is impossible for each Board member to read the entire record in each case and issue that volume of decisions. The Board depends on its staff in the Office of Appeals Counsel (and attorney advisors to the Board members) to conduct informed review of case records. In significant cases--in any case for that matter--a Board member may undertake complete or partial review of the record. Once the review process is understood, the preparation of a PFR can be enhanced through a recognition that it will be reviewed by the Board's staff attorneys who examine one case after another, a task unremitting in volume and, sometimes, tedium. PFRs should be concise, without personal attacks on opposing counsel or Board officials (unless there is a truly meritorious claim of bias or obstruction of justice). The PFR should accurately cite Board law and controlling court law. Moral imperatives do not count for much.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally the PFR process is complete after everyone who can, and who desires to, files a PFR, a cross-petition, a reply to the PFR, and a response to the reply. A motion filed in response to a PFR, e.g., a "motion to dismiss," may be treated as a response to the PFR. <span class="Italic">Stiles v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 250, 252 (1987). If the objection to an agency PFR is that it has not supplied interim relief, the appellant's objections will be treated as a motion to dismiss the agency PFR. <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. DOJ</span>, 53 MSPR 610, 614 (1992). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-077.html#sec5-77">Interim Relief</a>."] The Board does not seem inclined to receive supplements to a PFR after the filing deadline passes (one could supplement the PFR before the filing deadline), although a supplement will be received if it qualifies for admission as new and material evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hart v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 279, 281 &#x00B6; 5 (1998) (declining, when no new evidence was filed, to consider an "addendum" submission filed two months after the record on the PFR closed); <span class="Italic">Lawson v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 345, 349 n.1 (1995) (Board declined to consider the second PFR submitted by counsel after the close of the record on an initial PFR); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOD</span>, 41 MSPR 160, 164 n.2 (1989) (misinterpretation of the Board's regulations concerning submission of evidence did not excuse belated supplemental filing with PFR). The Board has accepted an amended PFR past the filing date for the underlying PFR when the two documents were essentially identical but the second was "far easier to read." <span class="Italic">Cohen v. GSA</span>, 48 MSPR 451, 456 (1991). The Board accepted an "Attachment to Appellant's Petition for Review," filed prior to the "close of the record," and after the initial, timely, filing of the PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Willis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 9, 10 n.1 (1991). The Board has considered two PFRs from the same party--one from the appellant, the other from appellant's representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shires v. DOD</span>, 60 MSPR 13, 16 n.1 (1993) (submissions from multiple representatives); <span class="Italic">Parker v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 603, 607 n.2 (1993) ("The appellant and his representative have each submitted a separate letter of petition, which together comprise the appellant's petition for review."). The Board decides the PFR once the record closes on the PFR. It is inappropriate to move to dismiss the PFR for failure to meet regulatory review criteria. The party opposing the PFR files an opposition to it, a cross-petition, or both. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">St. Clair v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 634, 635 n.2 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under current regulations, a party may file a reply to an opposition to a PFR, and that is an opportunity to further address significant arguments. Under 5 CFR 1201.114(a) (2022), the concluding filing will be:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;A reply to a response to a petition for review is limited to the factual and legal issues raised by another party in the response to the petition for review. It may not raise new allegations of error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board speaks of the "closing the record" in the PFR process, but in practice, unless there is some unusual event, the record closes without notice or fanfare once all the usual submissions have been filed or after the time has expired for the last submission. 5 CFR 1201.114(k) (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1640"></span>(k)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Closing the record</span>. The record closes on expiration of the period for filing the reply to the response to the petition for review or on expiration of the period for filing a response to the cross petition for review, whichever is later, or to the brief on intervention, if any, or on any other date the Board sets for this purpose. Once the record closes, no additional evidence or argument will be accepted unless it is new and material as defined in &#x00A7; 1201.115(d) and the party submitting it shows that the evidence or argument was not readily available before the record closed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once a PFR is filed, assuming no timeliness problems, it is logged in by the Clerk of the Board. After the response to the PFR is filed (along with the reply to the response) and the appeal file is received from the region, the package is reviewed by the Office of Appeals Counsel, the industrious lawyers who wade through the record and fashion a draft opinion for circulation among the Board members. When the draft decision is ready, it is circulated with supporting material among the three Board members and their counsel. If none of the Board members puts a "hold" on the case, the members check a box indicating their approval of the draft opinion, and the Board's Clerk is directed to issue the decision prepared by the Office of Appeals Counsel by signing it on behalf of the Board. If there is a timeliness problem with the PFR, the Clerk will issue a show cause order directing the party who apparently filed late to demonstrate timeliness or to request and justify a request to waive the PFR time limit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Board member who determines that the case is worthy of deeper consideration may prevent referral of a summary or other decision to the Clerk and obtain more intensive review of the appeal by the Board. Members may write their own decisions or issue under their own names the decisions prepared by the Office of Appeals Counsel. They may also return the cases to OAC for further research, analysis or rewriting. (Statement of Policy of June 29, 1981, concerning "Board Member Consideration of Petitions for Review from Field Office Decisions").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulatory process that the Board is to follow when it decides to review (or reopen) a case is described by 5 CFR 1201.117 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;In any case that is reopened or reviewed, the Board may:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Issue a decision that decides the case;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Hear oral arguments;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Require that briefs be filed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Remand the appeal so that the judge may take further testimony or evidence or make further findings or conclusions; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Take any other action necessary for final disposition of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The Board may affirm, reverse, modify, or vacate the initial decision of the judge, in whole or in part. The Board may issue a final decision and, when appropriate, order a date for compliance with that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;The Board may issue a decision in the form of a precedential Opinion and Order or a nonprecedential Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opinion and Order</span>. An Opinion and Order is a precedential decision of the Board and may be appropriately cited or referred to by any party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nonprecedential Orders.</span> A nonprecedential Order is one that the Board has determined does not add significantly to the body of MSPB case law. The Board may, in its discretion, include in nonprecedential Orders a discussion of the issue(s) to assist the parties in understanding the reason(s) for the Board's disposition in a particular appeal. Nonprecedential Orders are not binding on the Board or its administrative judges in any future appeals except when it is determined they have a preclusive effect on parties under the doctrines of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> (claim preclusion), collateral estoppel (issue preclusion), judicial estoppel, or law of the case. Parties may cite nonprecedential Orders, but such orders have no precedential value; the Board and its administrative judges are not required to follow or distinguish them in any future decisions. In contrast, a precedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified by the Board as significantly contributing to the Board's case law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Practice is simpler than the regulation suggests. In almost all cases, a PFR is filed, cross petitions are filed, responses and associated replies are filed, and the Board issues a decision either denying the PFR (and cross-PFR) and affirming the initial decision, or granting the PFR (or cross-PFR) and modifying the initial decision. The appeal may be remanded to the AJ for further development. Although starting in 2010 the Board received oral argument in a few appeals, the Board rarely hears oral argument, and it is rare for the Board to request further briefing, except in those few cases presenting significant issues leading the Board to request <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs. Denying oral argument in <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 387, 390 n.1 (1992), the Board summed up its view of public contact:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record in this appeal shows...that the parties had an adequate opportunity to present evidence and argument to support their respective positions both through written submissions and through testimony presented at the hearing. Further, the appellant does not explain why he believes that additional oral arguments are necessary....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Carr</span>, 78 MSPR 313, 320 (1998), denied oral argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We deny the respondent's request to present oral argument. While the Board's regulations at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117(a)(2) permit oral argument in a petition for review, the respondent has not stated any reason to grant her request. Her request does not indicate what evidence and argument she would present at oral argument or how such oral argument would add to the proceeding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Special Counsel v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 70 MSPR 41, 49 (1996) (the Board denied the intervenor's request for oral argument because it would not assist the Board significantly in deciding the case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Little v. TVA</span>, 20 MSPR 563, 565 n.2 (1984) ("Additionally, appellant has requested an opportunity to present oral arguments before the Board. While appellant has both a statutory and a regulatory right to a hearing on his initial appeal to the Board, appellant has no right to oral presentations on review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(l) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24 (c).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Santella v.</span>, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SANTELLA_FRANK_CB_1215_91_0007_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248436.pdf">86 MSPR 48</a>, 54 &#x00B6; 11 (2000), commented on a request for oral argument in a complex case involving a petition seeking a counsel fee award against OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117(a)(2) permit oral argument on a petition for review. A request for oral argument must indicate what evidence and argument the party would present at oral argument or how such oral argument would add to the proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Carr,</span> 78 MSPR 313, 320 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Here, although OSC is correct that this case raises several issues of first impression, because the resolution of those issues is largely a matter of statutory construction and each party has extensively briefed its position, we do not believe oral argument would aid the Board in making a decision<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Special Counsel v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 70 MSPR 41, 49 (1996) (the Board denied the intervenor's request for oral argument because it would not assist the Board significantly in deciding the case). Therefore we DENY OSC's request for oral argument.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Oral argument was received in <span class="Italic">Stephens v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 292, 296 (1987) (concerning retroactivity of a decision establishing a new basis for counsel fee awards). In 2010 and 2011, the Board received oral argument in several cases presenting what the Board considered to be major policy issues. Generally, however, oral argument is denied. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. DOJ</span>, 99 MSPR 256, 261 n.4 (2005) ("We also deny the appellants' requests for oral argument because they have not shown what evidence or argument they would present at oral argument or how such oral argument would add to the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.117(a)(2)<span class="Italic">; Social Security Administration v. Harty</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 117 Fed. Appx. 733 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Sakagawa v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 418, 420 n.1 (1993).") <span class="Italic">SSA v. Harty</span>, 96 MSPR 65, 71 &#x00B6; 13 (2004) (denying oral argument for all the usual reasons and adding: "contrary to the respondent's assertion, we discern no issues of first impression in this case that would warrant oral argument").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's disposition of a PFR may take several routes. The Board may close the case out with a precedential final decision or with a nonprecedential final order. The Board decides the case, reversing, affirming, or modifying the initial decision and deciding what penalty or remedy is to be issued. Its job is done. Collateral litigation over counsel fees, damages, or enforcement takes place, if at all, in the regional office where the appeal began, subject to possible further Board review of ensuing initial decisions on those collateral claims. Or it may occur that the Board may call for further briefing on issues, and public comment on those issues may be solicited, usually through a Federal Register notice. The Board may remand the case to the regional office to permit additional discovery, to conduct another hearing (or a supplemental hearing), or to fashion an appropriate remedy. If the initial decision is factually incomplete or inconsistent on a point critical to the resolution of the case, the Board may return the case to the region for another decision that resolves the conflict, or properly analyzes the law and applies it to the facts, and decides the appeal through another initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 55, 56 (1983). A PFR may then lie from points decided in the remand decision, but the PFR may not raise points that could or should have been addressed in a PFR from the original initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Detherage v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 30 MSPR 411, 414 (1986). It has occurred that, on timeliness, the Board accepted evidence directly rather than requiring remand for receipt and consideration of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 85 MSPR 607, 610-11 &#x00B6; 8 (2000).</p>
