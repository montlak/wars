<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-194"><span class="space">8.</span> Burden of Proof</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement agreements pose different burdens of proof than cases involving the enforcement of Board orders directing remedial action. The burdens of proof governing a petition seeking enforcement of a settlement were summarized, <span class="Italic">Ortega v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 422, 424-25 &#x00B6; 6 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement in this case because the underlying appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction and the settlement was entered into the record for enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 80 MSPR 459, 461 (1998). Because a settlement agreement is a contract, the Board will adjudicate an enforcement proceeding relevant to a settlement agreement in accordance with contract law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In a breach of contract action, the burden of proof rests on the party claiming breach. <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 541, 546 (1998). Therefore, an appellant asserting noncompliance bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that the agency breached the settlement agreement; however, following the appellant's filing of a petition for enforcement, the agency must produce relevant, material evidence of its compliance with the agreement. <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 80 MSPR at 461; <span class="Italic">Gannon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 660, 664 (1995). Mere assertions of compliance are insufficient to make that showing. <span class="Italic">Edmonds v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 68 MSPR 677, 680 (1995). The agency must produce documentation or affidavits showing compliance. <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 80 MSPR at 461. In sum, both parties are required to produce documentation or affidavits to prove assertions in a petition for enforcement concerning compliance with a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 80 MSPR at 461; <span class="Italic">Edmonds</span>, 68 MSPR at 680.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Torres v. DHS</span>, DA-0752-07-0066-C-2 (NP 4/4/2022) ("The appellant, as the party alleging noncompliance, bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that the agency breached the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Haefele v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). In response to a petition for enforcement claiming breach of a settlement agreement, the agency should submit evidence of the measures it took to comply, but this is a burden of production only; the overall burden of persuasion on the breach issue remains with the appellant. <span class="Italic">Turner v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). An administrative judge should hold an evidentiary <span id="Page_5058"></span>hearing if there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning the agency's breach of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(3)."); <span class="Italic">Azmat v. DHS</span>, PH-0432-12-0020-C-1 (NP 12/18/2014) ("A settlement agreement is a contract, and, as such, will be enforced in accord with contract law. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 7 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 420 F. App'x 980 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The Board will enforce a settlement agreement which has been entered into the record in the same manner as a final Board decision or order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Where the appellant alleges noncompliance with a settlement agreement, the agency must produce relevant material evidence of its compliance with the agreement or show that there was good cause for noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prevail, the appellant bears the ultimate burden of showing material noncompliance by the agency with the terms of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See Lutz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 9 (2009).

Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Where, as here, the facts are undisputed, the determination of whether there has been material noncompliance with the terms of the agreement necessarily reduces to a question of law. <span class="Italic">Lutz</span>, 485 F.3d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, and, as such, it will be enforced in accordance with contract law. <span class="Italic">Allen v.

Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Galatis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10 (2008). The Board has no authority to unilaterally modify the terms of the parties' settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">Galatis</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10, or to read a nonexistent term into an agreement that is unambiguous, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). The Board will consider parol evidence only if the agreement is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Galatis</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Haefele v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 11 (2008). The terms of an agreement are ambiguous as a result of differing interpretations as to the meanings or intent given to those terms by the parties only when the respective interpretations are both reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 7 (2003). When an agreement's words and meaning are unambiguous, its terms are not subject to variation. <span class="Italic">Slattery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge did not inform the appellant that, as the party asserting that the settlement agreement was breached, she has the burden of proving that the agency breached the agreement<span class="Italic">.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 MSPR 252, 254 (1994). Nor did the administrative judge inform the appellant of what she must do to meet her burden of proof. That is, the administrative judge did not inform the appellant that mere assertions of the agency's noncompliance are insufficient to show noncompliance, and that, instead, the appellant must offer evidence in the form of documentation or affidavits to support her claim that the agency has not complied with the terms of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See Vincent v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 263, 268-69 (1987) (party claiming noncompliance with a settlement agreement must offer evidence in the form of documentation or affidavits to support his claim of noncompliance); <span class="Italic">accord Edmonds v.

Under <span class="Italic">Golsby</span> a declaration by an agency official relating to compliance may be deemed insufficient, and documentary evidence of compliance may be required, if the declaration does not fully meet the appellant's allegation of agency noncompliance with the agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not raised by the parties on petition for review, the Board notes that the enforcement decision in this case implicitly placed the burden on the appellant to prove her assertions of agency noncompliance with the settlement agreement. It is well settled that the resolution of an appeal on the basis of a settlement agreement that is made a part of the record "constitutes a final decision issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, and, as a result, the Board has the authority to enforce the settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, 5 MSPR at 250. Should either party believe that the settlement agreement is not being properly implemented, the proper remedy is to petition for enforcement under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182 to the appropriate regional office. <span class="Italic">See Doster v.</span> <span class="Italic">Agency for International Development,</span> 9 MSPB 732, 10 MSPR 521, 522 (1982).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that this judicial precedent and analysis is generally applicable to the Board's enforcement proceedings. Therefore, the Board concludes that in a proceeding seeking the enforcement of a settlement agreement that was made a part of the record under <span class="Italic">Richardson,</span> 5 MSPR 248, the burden rests on the party asserting that the settlement agreement has been breached to prove such noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fredendall v. VA</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 371 (1988), also noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board acknowledges that the agency in this case has greater resources, expertise, and access to disputed records than does the appellant. Thus, the Board expects the agency in this case, and in all enforcement proceedings of a settlement agreement, to produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance with the agreement upon the request of the appellant.</p>

Nor does the agency's evidence of compliance include sufficient explanation regarding the steps it has taken to comply with the Board order.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis of the burdens of proof in enforcement litigation concerning settlements was modified to a degree in <span class="Italic">Perry v. Dept. of Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1993), involving a dispute over whether the agency complied with a settlement calling for the appellant's priority consideration for a position and determining that the agency has the duty to produce all of the evidence that it possesses to show that the provision was satisfied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The board held that Perry was required to prove that the Army did not comply with the agreement, citing <span class="Italic">Fredendall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 366 (MSPB 1988). The board then found that the agreement did not require the Army to explain its reasons for not selecting Perry, but only required that the Army consider Perry before considering anyone else. The board also found no evidence of bad faith because, among other things, there was "no evidence that the selecting official knew [Perry], was aware of either the disciplinary action against her or the settlement agreement, or had any other reason to act in bad faith (or in retaliation) with respect to her referral as a candidate for priority consideration." The board thus concluded that Perry failed to carry her burden of proof. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a party to a settlement agreement petitions for enforcement, the petitioner "must describe specifically the reasons the [petitioner] believes there is noncompliance" with the settlement agreement. 5 CFR 1201.182(a). The alleged noncomplying party must then file one of the following: (1) evidence of compliance; (2) evidence of compliance actions that have been taken, that are in process, and that remain, and a reasonable schedule for full compliance; or (3) a statement showing good cause for failure to comply completely. 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(1)(i)-(iii); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span>, 38 MSPR at 371 (discussing burden of production when agency asserted to be in noncompliance). Thereafter the petitioner may respond to the alleged noncomplying party's submissions. 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case the board placed on Perry the burden of proving the Army's noncompliance with the settlement agreement, citing the <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> case. There the board likened a petition for enforcement to an action for breach of contract, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The courts have determined that a court-approved settlement agreement of the parties is subject to the general rules of construction and enforceability regarding contracts. An action to enforce a settlement agreement is analogous to an action for breach of contract. In the usual case, the burden of proof in an action for breach of contract rests on the plaintiff. The courts, thus, require the plaintiff in an action based on the alleged breach of a settlement agreement to prove that the defendant committed such breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...Therefore, the Board concludes that in a proceeding seeking the enforcement of a settlement agreement...the burden rests on the party asserting that the settlement agreement has been breached to prove such noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fredendall</span>, 43 MSPR at 371 (citations omitted). In relying on these contract principles, the board made no mention of the requirements placed upon a noncomplying party by its own regulations, 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(1)(i)-(iii). It recognized, however, the greater resources, expertise and access to disputed records of the agency and said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, the board expects the agency in this case, and in all enforcement proceedings of a settlement agreement, to produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance with the agreement <span class="Italic">upon the request of the appellant</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fredendall</span>, 38 MSPR at 371.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is discernable tension between the board's regulations and its decision in <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span>. The regulations at a minimum obligate the respondent (usually the agency) to produce in most cases "evidence of compliance" within 15 days after the filing of a petition that merely "describes specifically the reasons the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance." Yet <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> indicates that the petitioner must request agency records and evidence before they have to be produced. Read more expansively, the regulations place a greater burden on the respondent than on the petitioner, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to prove complete compliance or when and how complete compliance will be achieved and to do so with "narrative explanation...and supporting documents," or to show good cause for noncompliance. Yet <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> expressly places the burden of proof on the petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without deciding whether <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> is reconcilable with the board's regulations, a matter that we believe should be considered by the board in the first instance, we conclude that it is sufficient to say in this case that both <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> and the regulations place a heavy burden of production on the agency. Here, the agency charged with failing to comply with the settlement agreement is wholly possessed of the evidence. It, therefore, has the duty of producing all of the evidence that it has to show that the provision of the agreement at issue has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, we are convinced that the agency has failed in this regard; it has not produced "all of the relevant material and credible evidence of its compliance" that was available to it. <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span>, 38 MSPR at 371. Thus, the board legally erred in denying petitioner's claim on the basis that she failed to satisfy her ultimate burden of proof as required by the <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perry</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Hansson v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3072). In <span class="Italic">Hansson</span>, the appellant complained that the agency did not abide by the agreement to expunge from all personnel files any record of the action taken against him. The Board found the agency in compliance based upon an ambiguous and brief response to the appellant's enforcement petition. The agency did not submit evidence supporting the assertions in its response. Lacking a proper evidentiary showing by the agency, the court remanded the case to the Board to permit the agency to satisfy its burden of production of evidence for proper Board adjudication of the enforcement petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sweet v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 28, 35 &#x00B6; 16 (2001) (agency representative's statement was not evidence of compliance with a settlement when it was not in the form of an affidavit or made under the penalty of perjury); <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. DOJ</span>, 80 MSPR 459, 462 &#x00B6; 9 (1998) (as to a promise in a settlement to ensure clean personnel files, agency's statement that it was 'in total compliance' with the agreement was not evidence of compliance because it was not in affidavit form or made under the penalty of perjury: "We find that the administrative judge erred by basing her compliance determination on the agency's unsworn, general statement of compliance and by not specifically addressing whether the agency had expunged the appellant's OPF of 'all other information relating to [the] demotion' as required by the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rickels v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 677, 680 (1996) (agency representative's unsworn statement that the record was purged did not overcome contrary allegations by the appellant supported by documentation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result of <span class="Italic">Perry's</span> requirement that the agency produce all the evidence it has to show compliance with a settlement, the Board modified the <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> analysis regarding the order of production of proof in compliance disputes involving settlements. <span class="Italic">Jones v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 252, 254 (1994), explained that "to the extent that <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> holds that the agency does not have to produce evidence until <span class="Italic">requested</span> by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> is modified to eliminate that holding":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law of contracts applies to settlement agreements in Board cases. <span class="Italic">See Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In an action for breach of contract, the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff, who is required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed breach. Thus appellant has the burden of proof here. <span class="Italic">See Fredendall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 38 MSPR 366, 371 (1988); <span class="Italic">Kolassa v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 59 MSPR 151, 154 (1993). <span class="Italic">See also Corbin on Contracts</span> (1986), &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 709 (one who asserts a breach is ordinarily required to prove facts establishing such a breach) and 1230 (the plaintiff must prove the fact of breach).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This burden must, however, be viewed in the context of the Board's procedural regulations. In <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed.

The agency's duty to produce evidence of compliance is triggered by the filing of a petition for enforcement, according to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(a). Therefore, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> holds that the agency does not have to produce evidence until <span class="Italic">requested</span> by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> is modified to eliminate that holding.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reniere v. USDA</span>, 62 MSPR 648, 650-53 (1994), was one of a series of decisions allowing an appellant to set aside a settlement after the employer breached a provision calling for a favorable employment reference. In <span class="Italic">Reniere</span>, the agency was faulted for failing to fully counter appellant's hearsay evidence of the breach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant initially filed an appeal with the Board's Washington Regional Office from the agency's action removing her from her position as a secretary, GS-6. On March 23, 1992, the parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving their dispute and providing, in pertinent part, that the agency would make no statement to possible employers <span id="Page_5060"></span>referencing unacceptable performance. The administrative judge found the agreement to be valid, entered it into the record for enforcement purposes, and dismissed the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently accepted employment with the National Headquarters of the Salvation Army and learned, upon her arrival, that the agency had not given her a good reference. She then filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement, alleging that the agency breached the agreement and that the breach diminished her opportunities for employment in the Federal sector. The administrative judge denied the petition, finding that the appellant had failed to prove the agency's breach of the agreement because the evidence presented in support was unsigned and unauthenticated. In addition, she found that the appellant had not been harmed because the appellant's present employer hired her despite any negative reference from the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a proceeding seeking enforcement of a settlement agreement, current decisions of the Board provide that the party alleging breach of the agreement bears the ultimate burden of proof on the issue of noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Fredendall v.

The regulations require that the petitioner for enforcement "must describe specifically the reasons [she] believes there is noncompliance" with the agreement. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). The party allegedly in breach must then file either: (1) evidence of compliance; (2) evidence of compliance actions that have been taken, that are in process, and that remain, and a reasonable schedule for full compliance; or (3) a statement showing good cause for failure to fully comply. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(1)(i)-(iii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While not deciding whether <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> is inconsistent with the Board's regulations concerning petitions for enforcement, the court held that "both <span class="Italic">Fredendall</span> and the regulations place a heavy burden of production on the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he regulations place a greater burden on the respondent than on the petitioner, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to prove complete compliance or when and how complete compliance will be achieved and to do so with "narrative explanation...and supporting documents" or to show good cause for noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Finally, the court found that, when the agency charged with breach of the settlement agreement is wholly possessed of the evidence, it must produce all of the evidence that it has to show that it is in compliance with the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This increased focus on the agency's burden of production in enforcement proceedings is especially important when the party petitioning for enforcement relies on hearsay evidence to show noncompliance. While hearsay is admissible in administrative proceedings before the Board, the assessment of the probative value of such evidence depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 258 (1988); <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR 77, 83-87 (1981). Hearsay evidence may constitute substantial evidence, but it may not be sufficient to constitute preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Tamburello v. US Postal Service</span>, 45 MSPR 455, 466 (1990). The administrative judge must assess the probative value of the hearsay evidence<span class="Italic">. See Scroggins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 558, 565 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the agency was clearly possessed of the evidence of compliance with the agreement, through the testimony of its employee, Dr. Stafford. Under the rationale of <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, the agency was required to produce all of its evidence showing compliance, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a straightforward statement from Dr. Stafford regarding the negative responses rather than the agency's attempt to circumvent the issue through its admission that Dr. Stafford "responded to some specific questions asked." <span class="Italic">Perry</span> decrees that the burden of proof does not rest entirely on the appellant; the agency must produce all of the evidence in its possession bearing on compliance. <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579. In this case, the agency's tacit admission that it had responded negatively to the request for a reference is sufficient to establish the appellant's allegations, and, therefore, we find that the administrative judge erred in concluding otherwise.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Additionally, part of the appellant's burden is to at least plead a breach of an agreement; without this argument the appellant fails to meet his burden of showing that the agency breached the settlement. <span class="Italic">See Baig, supra</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant fails to meet his burden of proving noncompliance with a settlement, his case is not rescued through an attack on the agency's evidence of compliance, <span class="Italic">Allen v. VA</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. 980, 986-87 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen also argues that, even if the agency was required to purge removal-related documents only from his OPF, the declarations submitted by the agency to demonstrate compliance with this obligation were insufficient to prove that the agency actually removed all such documents. This argument is unpersuasive, however, because it was Mr. Allen, and not the agency, who had the burden of proving breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a), which requires an agency accused of non-compliance with an agreement to come forward with evidence of compliance, the agency submitted two sworn declarations. In the first, Ms. Anderson averred that she "instructed the Health Resource Center" ("HRC"), which maintains the agency's OPFs, "to remove from the Appellant's OPF all documentation related to his removal from the VA, and to replace this information with an SF-50" reflecting Mr. Allen's resignation. The agency also submitted a declaration from Assistant Human Resources Officer Jennifer LuttJohan of HRC confirming that "the information contained in [Mr. Allen's] OPF which referenced his removal from [the agency] was replaced with an SF-50 stating that [Mr. Allen] resigned from the VA." Ms. LuttJohan further averred that "there is no <span id="Page_5061"></span>other documentation in [Mr. Allen's] OPF that shows he was disciplined or removed." Mr. Allen, on the other hand, presented no evidence showing that the agency failed to expunge all removal-related documents from his OPF other than the fact that the agency disclosed removal documents to OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen's contention that the agency's declarations were insufficient to prove compliance conflates the agency's burden of moving forward with evidence of compliance with the ultimate burden of proving breach. While the agency was required to produce evidence "of the compliance actions that the party ha[d] completed, and a statement of the actions that are in process and the actions that remain to be taken," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a), the Board found that the agency discharged this obligation by submitting declarations averring that: (1) the agency instructed HRC to remove the relevant documents from Mr. Allen's OPF; and (2) an inspection of Mr. Allen's OPF revealed that information related to his removal had been removed and was replaced with an SF-50 reflecting Mr. Allen's resignation. Once the agency satisfied this burden of production, it was Mr. Allen who had the burden of proving that the relevant documents were not removed from his OPF. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 252, 254 (M.S.P.B. 1994) (party asserting breach bears the ultimate burden of proving facts establishing breach notwithstanding 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)) (citing <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> (1986), &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 709 (one who asserts a breach is ordinarily required to prove facts establishing such a breach) and 1230 (the plaintiff must prove the fact of breach). The Board properly weighed the evidence presented by both sides and concluded that Mr. Allen failed to prove that the agency maintained removal related documents in his OPF, rather than in some other file. Because substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion, we find no error as to this issue.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 596, 602 (1992) (remand may occur if the appellant does not prove the allegation of noncompliance and the agency does not meet its obligation to respond to the appellant's claim); <span class="Italic">Perry v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency offers evidence of compliance that does not draw an objection from the appellant, the Board is likely to find the agency compliant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chojnacki v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 690 (1995) (Table) (settlement agreement calling for the payment of counsel fees: the Board found compliance when, without objection from appellant, agency responded to an enforcement petition by explaining that agency's chief counsel submitted a memo to the agency's financial manager requesting that the fees be paid). Applying the burdens of proof, the Board decided that an appellant who alleges that an agency has been improperly maintaining and disseminating information about a settled removal has the burden of establishing that the agency is maintaining records of his removal. <span class="Italic">Soffer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 402, 405 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Impossibility of performance may be a defense to an asserted breach of a settlement. The burden of showing impossible performance rests with the party making that assertion. <span class="Italic">Nance v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 55 MSPR 68, 71 n.2 (1992). Assuming a dispute over compliance rather than the impossibility of performance, the basic rule on compliance was stated in <span class="Italic">Lyon v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 179, 183 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a proceeding seeking enforcement of a settlement agreement, the agency must produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance with the agreement upon the request of the appellant. The ultimate burden, however, is on the appellant, as the party seeking enforcement, to show that the agency has failed to fulfill the terms of the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency's defense to enforcement proceedings is the appellant's noncompliance with a provision of a settlement agreement, the appellant may need to demonstrate compliance to obtain the <span class="Italic">quid</span> <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">quo</span> from the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v.
