<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-132"><span class="space">c.</span> Labor Arbitration Awards</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1570"></span>Employees in bargaining units with collective bargaining contracts may elect to pursue through contract grievance processes actions otherwise appealable to the Board. For employees who are not in the Postal Service, the Board may review at the headquarters level the otherwise appealable action that resulted in an arbitration decision or award if discrimination is alleged before the arbitrator. For Postal Service employees who would otherwise have Board appeal rights, arbitration may be pursued under a collective bargaining contract; those employees may also have the right to appeal to the Board, that is, they are not forced to elect their remedy. By way of a request for Board review of an arbitration award for a Title 5 employee, or by way of a Board appeal by a Postal Service employee whose case was already arbitrated, the question is whether at the Board the arbitration award receives deference or has collateral estoppel effect. [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-12-266.html#sec5-265">Postal Service Employees</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-12-267.html#sec5-266">Effect of Arbitration Award on Board Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit approved application of collateral estoppel to an arbitrator's decision during a later Board appeal by a Postal Service employee, <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 238 (Fed. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a preference eligible employee, Kroeger was entitled to appeal his removal to the Board.... On appeal to the Board, an appellant has a right to a hearing.... Kroger did appeal and did receive a hearing. Kroeger is simply wrong in equating his right to an appeal and a hearing with a right to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review that would preclude application of collateral estoppel. Preference eligibility cannot justify relitigation of conclusively determined factual matters. The statute provides for an appeal but nowhere does it provide for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review and nowhere does it preclude use of collateral estoppel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the decision of a labor arbitrator can result in collateral estoppel before the board is a matter of first impression in this court. Other courts, however, have given an arbitration decision that meets the appropriate standards the same preclusive effect as any other decision.... We <span class="Italic">see</span> no reason why an arbitrator's decision should not be given collateral estoppel effect before the board in the appropriate case, and no reason, in such cases, to force witnesses (if still available) to return for a repeat performance of their testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In [<span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 581 (1987)], after determining that Postal Service preference eligible employees should be treated no differently respecting the applicability of particular legal doctrines,...the board found it inappropriate to apply collateral estoppel in relation to arbitrators' decisions citing distinctive elements in the nature of an arbitral proceeding.... The board went on, however, to accord the arbitrator's decision "deference," saying "the board will, in most cases, only set them aside or modify them where the appellant shows that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The board's indication in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, that collateral estoppel may never be applied to preclude re-litigation of issues that had been submitted to binding arbitration, is incorrect. There are and will be cases in which application of collateral estoppel to the arbitrator's decision is justified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel is justified on the facts here. In [<span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 794 F.2d 661 (Fed. Cir. 1986)], this court identified the criteria for application of collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;the issue previously adjudicated is identical with that now presented, (ii) that issue was "actually litigated" in the prior case, (iii) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the end-decision then made, and (iv) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he board did not err in holding that the ALJ properly adopted the arbitrator's findings, and would not have erred if it had approved the ALJ's application of collateral estoppel in this case to bar Kroeger from relitigating facts found by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kroeger does not say he was denied opportunity to litigate the facts fully and fairly before the arbitrator. Nor does he set forth anything that was not presented to the arbitrator, but would be presented at a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing before the ALJ. Nor does he argue that the arbitration proceeding failed to meet any of the criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>. He simply labels the application of collateral estoppel "unfair." Some courts have cited fairness as a fifth criterion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Otherson</span>, 711 F.2d at 272. Unfairness, however, is not an abstract concept supportable by mere assertions that procedures may in some cases differ before the ALJ and the arbitrator. Unfairness sufficient to bar application of collateral estoppel requires a specific showing that the precise dispute was not fairly litigated and resolved before the arbitrator. Kroeger has made no such showing.</p>

In <span class="Italic">Kirkpatrick</span>, the court analyzed several specific arguments raised by the petitioner in an attempt to demonstrate that, on the facts or on the law, the dispute was not fairly litigated and resolved before the arbitrator.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board applied collateral estoppel to penalty review in USPS arbitration proceedings, other than as to EEO issues, involving preference eligible employees<span class="Italic">.

USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 230, 234-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2000) (collateral estoppel was applied to a penalty determination when the arbitrator considered factors analogous to those itemized in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>); <span class="Italic">Farmer v.

USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 348, 353 n.6 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Berkey</span>). But in <span class="Italic">Milligan v. USPS</span>, 106 MSPR 414, 417-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-19, 2007 MSPB 193 (2007), the appellant pursued a removal case to arbitration while he also <span id="Page_1571"></span>filed an EEO complaint that challenged the removal. The arbitrator sustained the charges but mitigated the penalty to a suspension for "time-served," along with a reassignment. After the agency issued a final agency decision finding no reprisal or discrimination, the appellant, a preference-eligible employee, filed an appeal with the Board. The AJ applied principles of collateral estoppel and upheld the penalty. The Board then issued a decision stating that time-served suspensions are contrary to <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis, and legal errors, such as that involved in the penalty analysis, constitute an exception to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The Board rejected application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to the preference eligible Postal Service employee's appeal because the arbitration award was contrary to Board precedent involving time-served suspensions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, the AJ's discussion of the penalty is flawed as it relies on case law related to the standard of Board review of arbitrators' decisions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). Section 7121 does not apply to Postal Service cases. A preference-eligible Postal employee can file a grievance pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) <span class="Italic">and</span> a Board appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 from the same adverse action. <span class="Italic">Mays v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 995 F.2d 1056, 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 811 F.2d 1498, 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Marjie v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 95, 98 (1996) (a Postal Service employee with Board appeal rights may file a grievance and a Board appeal from the same action, but such an employee does not have a right of Board review of an arbitration decision). An appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 is a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceeding. <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 607, 610-11 (1991). The burden and standards of proof in such a proceeding are governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, and do not include review of an arbitrator's findings under a deferential or any other standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, this case presents the question of whether collateral estoppel may be applied to the arbitrator's penalty selection. A party is collaterally estopped from relitigating an issue when (1) the issue is identical to one in a prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded by the doctrine had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action. <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005). Normally, when a Postal grievance goes to arbitration and the criteria for collateral estoppel are met, neither the employee, nor the Postal Service, may relitigate the propriety of the penalty in a subsequent Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Farrelly v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 13 Fed. Appx. 910 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Farmer v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 13 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the criteria for collateral estoppel have been met. However, the Board has repeatedly held that, even where these criteria have been met, there are circumstances in which it is improper to apply collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">E.g., Hay v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 167, &#x00B6; 9 (2006) (the Board may refrain from applying collateral estoppel if its application would result in injustice or compromise public policy); <span class="Italic">Fulks v. Department of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-27 (2005) (collateral estoppel should not be applied to an arbitration decision in which the penalty was determined by accident, i.e., by reference to the length of time taken by the appeal or administrative review process); <span class="Italic">Tanner v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 15 (2003) (the reviewing body may refrain from applying collateral estoppel if injustice or other public policy considerations would be compromised); <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 48, 50-51 (1991) (collateral estoppel does not apply to pure questions of law or where the prior decision is facially incorrect under the Board's interpretation of civil service law). "For example, 'redetermination of issues may be warranted due to the different nature of one forum as compared to the other, or where there is reason to doubt the quality, extensiveness, or procedural or substantive fairness of the prior adjudication.'" <span class="Italic">Tanner,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 15. The Federal Circuit and Supreme Court have recognized the propriety of declining to apply collateral estoppel in such circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Haring v. Prosise,</span> 462 U.S. 306, 313 n.7 (1983) (collateral estoppel is inappropriate when "controlling facts or legal principles have changed significantly" since the prior judgment, or when "special circumstances warrant an exception to the normal rules of preclusion"); <span class="Italic">Standefer v. United States,</span> 447 U.S. 10, 23 n.18 (1980) (the estoppel doctrine is "premised upon an underlying confidence that the result achieved in the initial litigation was substantially correct"; "[i]n the absence of appellate review, or of similar procedures, such confidence is often unwarranted"); <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (where the requirements for collateral estoppel have been met, it would not be error for the Board to decline to apply that doctrine).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, collateral estoppel may not be used to adopt a time-served suspension because doing so would be contrary to Board precedent. <span class="Italic">See Fulks,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-27; <span class="Italic">Montalvo,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. at 50-51. In the seminal case on this issue, <span class="Italic">Montalvo,</span> the Board held that collateral estoppel effect cannot be given to an arbitrator's decision if the arbitrator mitigated the appellant's removal to a time-served suspension without pay. <span class="Italic">Montalvo,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. at 50. The Board found that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to a pure question of law, such as whether the length of a suspension may be "determined by accident, rather than by a process of logical deliberation and decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Instead, arbitrators must apply the same substantive rules the Board must use when it reviews agency disciplinary actions, including application of Board precedent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 50-51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With that in mind, the applicable Board case law requires the body reviewing a disciplinary action to consider the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). Returning to <span class="Italic">Montalvo,</span> the Board in that case found that the arbitrator considered a number of factors in support of his mitigation decision, but he did not conduct a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis or articulate any rationale for mitigating the penalty to a time-served suspension. <span class="Italic">Montalvo,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. at 50. Thus, the Board held that the arbitrator's decision to mitigate Appellant Montalvo's penalty was contrary to prior court and Board rulings holding that suspension determinations made without articulation of a reasonable basis for the penalty selection are barred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 51. Using this rationale, the Board went on to make its own penalty determination based on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Montalvo,</span> the arbitrator failed to conduct a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis. Therefore, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Montalvo,</span> the Board must make its own penalty determination in the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Strengthening the argument that the Board must make its own penalty determination in this case is the recent Board decision of <span class="Italic">Fulks v. Department of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 228 (2005). Admittedly, <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> is distinguishable from the instant appeal because it involved the Board's review of a non-Postal Service arbitration decision. However, <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> is still relevant to the present case because in it the Board revisited and expanded its prior holding in <span class="Italic">Montalvo.</span> Specifically, the Board held that an arbitrator's penalty selection of a time-served suspension cannot stand even if the arbitrator considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. As was the case in <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span>, <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> discussed the propriety of giving arbitration decisions collateral estoppel effect in situations where the arbitrator mitigated the agency's chosen penalty of removal to a time-served suspension. However, in <span class="Italic">Fulks,</span> the Board further concluded that the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span> actually did consider at least some of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. In support of this conclusion, the Board noted that the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span> had set forth a number of factors that he considered in mitigating the penalty. Consequently, the Board held that the law in <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span> is clear; a time-served penalty is not improper simply because an arbitrator fails to consider the proper <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in deciding whether mitigation is appropriate. Rather, such a penalty is inappropriate if it is "determined by accident," i.e., by reference to the length of time taken by the grievance process (a time-served suspension). <span class="Italic">Fulks,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 27. To put it more simply, the Board cannot sustain penalties that are arbitrary on their face. If an arbitrator imposes a time-served suspension penalty, the Board must hold that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law pertaining to mitigation authority. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board may not apply collateral estoppel or otherwise impose the time-served suspension penalty selected by the arbitrator in this case. The proper course of action is to apply collateral estoppel to the arbitrator's decision with regard to the charged misconduct. Under <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span> and <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, the Board is free to adopt the arbitrator's factual findings and then apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to those findings to determine the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 50-51; <span class="Italic">see Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that it appears that under the CBA between the agency and its union, the agency may be required to comply with the arbitrator's decision to mitigate the removal, despite the impropriety of the time-served suspension penalty under Board law. Even so, as explained above, this is a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, and the case law precludes us from imposing the arbitrator's time-served suspension penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our dissenting colleague disagrees and would give <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect to the arbitrator's decision. We have found no case in which the Board has applied <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to an arbitration decision involving an employee of the Postal Service with Board appeal rights. Indeed, we believe that the application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> in such cases would essentially prevent Postal Service employees with Board appeal rights from pursing both a grievance under their negotiated grievance procedure and an appeal to the Board. In defining <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, the Supreme Court has stated: "Under <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action." <span class="Italic">Allen v. McCurry,</span> 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980). The Court has further noted "Because <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> may govern grounds and defenses not previously litigated...it blockades unexplored paths that may lead to truth...It therefore is to be invoked only after careful inquiry." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Felsen,</span> 442 U.S. 127, 132 (1979). The application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> in the instant case is tantamount to requiring an election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). That section provides that an individual affected by a personnel <span id="Page_1572"></span>action that is both appealable to the Board and covered by a negotiated grievance procedure may contest the action before the Board or via a grievance, but not both. This rule, however, does not apply to Postal Service employees who have the right to appeal actions directly to the Board. Such employees may file a grievance and a Board appeal from the same action. <span class="Italic">Marjie,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. at 98. Giving <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect to an arbitrator's decision in this context would make it effectively impossible to pursue both a Board appeal and a grievance because the resolution of the grievance through an arbitration decision would bar any litigation through a Board appeal. For these reasons, we find that it is inappropriate to apply the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to arbitration decisions involving Postal Service employees who have Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This does not, however, mean that other principles of preclusion are inapplicable. The Board has long applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel to arbitration decisions involving Postal Service employees with Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Farrelly,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12. In contrast to <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, collateral estoppel bars the relitigation only of those issues of fact or law actually decided in the initial litigation. <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 449 U.S. at 94. In further contrast to <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, collateral estoppel, as discussed earlier, need not be applied when the result in the initial litigation is incorrect or would compromise public policy. <span class="Italic">Standefer,</span> 447 U.S. at 23 n.18. <span class="Italic">Cf. Federated Department Stores v. Moitie,</span> 452 U.S. 394, 398 (1981) ("<span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> consequences" of a final judgment in a prior action are not altered by the fact that "the judgment may have been wrong.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although application of collateral estoppel may result in a bar of further litigation, that will not always be the case. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Farrelly,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 230, the Board applied collateral estoppel to give preclusive effect to all of the findings and conclusions in the arbitrator's decision denying the appellant's grievance. Yet in <span class="Italic">Hay,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 167, the Board declined to apply the collateral estoppel doctrine because to do so would result in injustice or compromise public policy. Because the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to issues or defenses not decided in the initial litigation and because it allows an exception for legally incorrect decisions, its application to arbitration decisions involving Postal Service employees with Board appeal rights does not result in an absolute bar to pursuit of a Board appeal. Instead, it provides a proper balance between the rights of such employees to pursue both a grievance and a Board appeal and the interest in conserving judicial resources that is served by the principles of preclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed earlier, we do not apply collateral estoppel to the arbitrator's penalty in this case. This would ordinarily require the Board to make the penalty determination. The Board, however, will not make that determination at this time because the litigation of this case raises an issue of fairness. In the prehearing conference, the administrative judge advised the parties that "the penalty that will be reviewed" in this appeal is the "time-served suspension and reassignment" imposed by the arbitrator. Again in her initial decision, the administrative judge indicated that she was reviewing the reasonableness of the time-served suspension. Thus, the appellant pursued his appeal with the objective of obtaining outright reversal of the disciplinary action taken against him, or alternatively, further mitigation beyond what the arbitrator ordered. The case was not litigated as a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> appeal of the removal action and the appellant was not aware of the possibility that the removal action could be upheld. In such circumstances, we find that fairness dictates that this case be remanded for the parties to litigate the propriety of the agency's removal penalty.</p>

In facts not clear from the opinion, the Board stated in <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that if an appellant's case was in some fashion related to a grievance prosecuted by the appellant, and if the AJ independently had jurisdiction over and independently reviewed the facts of the case, the agency's ultimate disposition of the appellant's grievance would not serve as a ground for reversal of the AJ's disposition of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Graham v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 47, 49, 4 MSPB 137 (1980) (apparently a grievance under a labor agreement). This point was more clearly made in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 184, 187 (1997), involving a grievance that was not pursued through arbitration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may apply collateral estoppel if: (1) The issue previously adjudicated is identical to that now presented; (2) that issue was actually litigated in the prior case; (3) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded by the doctrine was fully represented in the prior case. <span class="Italic">See Kroeger v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Peartree v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 332, 341 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "actual litigation" prerequisite for the application of collateral estoppel means that the issue must have been contested by the parties and submitted for determination by the court. <span class="Italic">See Raymond v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 34 MSPR 476, 480 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Otherson v. Dept. of Justice,</span> 711 F.2d 267, 273 (D.C. Cir. 1983)); <span class="Italic">see also Fisher v. Dept. of Defense,</span> 64 MSPR 509, 514 (1994) (the "actual litigation" criterion requires that the issue must have been contested by the parties and resolved by the adjudicator). Implicit in this requirement is the notion that, when the parties "contest" an issue, the issue will be submitted for determination and resolved by a court or other neutral adjudicator. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fisher,</span> 64 MSPR at 513-15 (applying collateral estoppel to a prior Board decision); <span class="Italic">Curry v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 336, 339 (1992) (applying collateral estoppel to Postal Service arbitration proceedings); <span class="Italic">Raymond</span>, 34 MSPR at 481 (applying collateral estoppel to a guilty plea conviction in a Federal district court).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Step 3 grievance, which accused the agency of violating various provisions of the Negotiated Agreement, was submitted by the appellant and his union for determination by an agency management official. In no sense can the issue of the voluntariness of the appellant's absence be deemed "actually litigated" when, in effect, the appellant presented his case to his opposing party and his opposing party ruled against him.</p>
