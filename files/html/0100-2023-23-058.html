<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-58"><span class="space">5.</span> Unfiled Settlement Agreement; Preappeal Settlement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under Wade v. VA</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 582-84 (1994), "a party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement resulting in the withdrawal of an appeal, even when that agreement is not entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held in <span class="Italic">Schultze v. Department of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 250, 255 (1993), that it lacked the authority to set aside a settlement agreement that had not been incorporated into the record of a Board appeal for purposes of enforcement of the agreement. The Board further held that coercion by an agency representative or an administrative judge might nonetheless invalidate the withdrawal of an appeal that results from such an agreement. The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Schultze</span> that the administrative judge erred by informing the appellant that she could request Board review of the initial decision if she believed that the settlement agreement was unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 254 n.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board does not have the authority to enforce a settlement agreement not entered into the record for enforcement purposes, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Diamond v. US Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 448, 450 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 972 F.2d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table), that principle does not preclude us from ensuring the validity and integrity of the appellate process. The essence of a settlement agreement is that it must be a voluntary action. An agreement that is reached by virtue of fraud or mutual mistake is, by definition, involuntary. Similarly, we do not countenance an agreement that is unlawful on its face or otherwise. Thus, we find that a party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement resulting in the withdrawal of an appeal, even when that agreement is not entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See King v. US Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 60, 64-65 (1991). We therefore overrule the holding in <span class="Italic">Schultze</span> to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not explain how conducting the settlement negotiations over the telephone caused his acceptance of the agreement to be involuntary. His allegation that the settlement agreement should be set aside because the negotiations were conducted over the telephone lacks specific support and does not show that he did not willfully and knowingly enter into the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 48 MSPR 330, 333 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the settlement agreement should be set aside because he had only a high school education and was unrepresented during the telephonic settlement conference, while the agency's representative during the conference was an attorney. The appellant apparently believes that he was somehow disadvantaged during the proceedings before the Board because the agency's representative was an attorney. The Board's regulations, however, allow parties wide discretion in choosing their representatives, subject only to disqualification for conflict of interest or position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.31; <span class="Italic">Walton v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 48 MSPR 462, 469 (1991). The appellant appears to have elected not to have his representative present during the telephonic conference, and must now accept any consequences of that election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, parties to a settlement agreement are presumed to have full legal capacity to contract unless they are under guardianship, an infant, mentally ill or defective, or intoxicated. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 57 MSPR 16, 20 (1993). The appellant did not assert below, and he does not now assert, that he lacked full legal capacity to enter into the settlement agreement. He has submitted no evidence showing that he was unable to understand the nature of the settlement agreement or that his decision was not an informed one. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Riley v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 671, 677 (1992).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review of the initial decision issued on September 14, 2010, that dismissed her individual right of action appeal as withdrawn pursuant to settlement.

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 580, 583 (1994). The appellant submits a declaration sworn under the penalty of perjury asserting among other things that the agency misled her during July 22, 2010 settlement negotiations of the agreement that was executed on August 30, 2010, by telling her that there were no positions open in the Hindi Department. The appellant's attorney also submitted a declaration sworn under the penalty of perjury supporting the appellant's claim of agency misrepresentation and stating that he would not have counseled his client to enter into the August 30, 2010 agreement if he had known the truth about the availability of a position in the Hindi Department. The agency responded by submitting an unsworn declaration generally objecting to the appellant's sworn declaration. Although the sequence of events is not entirely clear, the appellant's new evidence indicates that there was an overlap in time between the date that the parties signed the settlement agreement on August 30, 2010, and an opening in the Hindi Department that was advertised on the USAJobs website with an open application period from August 25, 2010, through January 28, 2011.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of facts, which if proven, could justify setting aside the settlement agreement.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wade</span> was extended to require analysis of last chance agreements entered before any appealable action, i.e., entered after an adverse action proposal and before a decision, and then implemented by adverse action, by <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 137, 140 (1994) [discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-087.html#sec2-86">Adverse Action or Performance-Based Appeal Arising from Last Chance or Other Settlement Agreement</a>"]. In <span class="Italic">Short v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 214, 218-21 (1994), an appellant's allegations were sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the Board to consider the voluntariness of a preappeal settlement leading to a demotion. The appellant raised the issues of duress and mental condition, i.e., depression:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x2003;An employee-initiated action, such as a resignation, is presumed to be voluntary unless the employee presents sufficient evidence to establish that the action was obtained through duress or coercion or shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ward v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 60 MSPR 306, 308-09 (1994); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 59 MSPR 4, 7 (1993). An involuntary resignation is tantamount to a removal and is subject to the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wilson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 212, 214 (1991). The appellant's resignation was, however, a term of the pre-appeal settlement agreement. The Board has the authority to consider the validity of a pre-appeal settlement agreement, by which the appellant agreed to resign, so as to determine its effect on a personnel action before the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vasquez v. US Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 128, 130-31 (1994); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 63 MSPR 649, 658-59 (1994). A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement if the party believes that such agreement was unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 583 (1994). Further, where an appellant alleges emotional distress as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board will consider whether the appellant was represented below; whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time of the settlement agreement; and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his representative in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. VA</span>, 50 MSPR 676, 678 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his contention that the settlement agreement and his resignation were involuntary because of his physical and mental conditions, the appellant submitted, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, his own affidavit, an affidavit from Betty Good, a Licensed Social Worker in the Mental Health Department in Kaiser Permanente, Ms. Good's certification of his medical treatment, and an affidavit from Diane Gray, his "close personal companion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his affidavit, the appellant described his mental and physical conditions before, on, and after February 1, 1994, when he entered into the settlement agreement. He stated that he was being treated for insomnia, depression, difficulty in concentration, stress, diabetes, cholesterol, and back pain. He stated that Ms. Good informed him that the agency's 1993 reorganization might have been the source of his stress, and he described his work-related problems leading up to the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her affidavit, Ms. Good stated that she saw the appellant professionally on several occasions from November 4, 1993, through February 1, 1994. She stated that she diagnosed him as suffering from "Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood," and that she "did not observe any significant improvement or deterioration" in his condition. She stated that she met with the appellant on February 4, 1994, at which time he reported "that for the two nights preceding February 1, 1994, he did not sleep and had experienced dry heaves, dizziness and a distinct feeling that "his world was closing in" [sic]. She stated that the appellant reported that he had almost jumped out of a moving car driven by someone else and that he had "other self-destructive urges." Ms. Good further stated that the appellant complained "that he was experiencing physical symptoms, including pain in his chest, right arm, and left leg; chronic nausea; headaches; blurring vision, cold sweats...high blood pressure and elevated blood sugars." She stated that, on February 4, 1994, she "assessed [the appellant] to be suffering from Major Depression, Single Episode," and that Dr. Michael Horn, a psychiatrist at Kaiser Permanente Mental Health Department, saw the appellant on the same day and concurred in her assessment. She opined that, on February 1, 1994, the appellant was incapable of making a rational decision concerning settlement relating to his employment. In her medical certification of <span id="Page_4848"></span>treatment, Ms. Good stated that, on February 4, 1994, the appellant received treatment for major depression.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her affidavit, Ms. Gray stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that, based on her observation of the appellant on February 1, 1994, he appeared to be very depressed, to be incapable of making rational decisions, and to be uncertain of his actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, as to his argument that the settlement agreement was procured under time pressure, the appellant stated in his affidavit that, on January 31, 1994, he received a call at home from the proposing official, Nearis Harvey, ordering him to report at 10:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> the following morning to pick up the decision letter on the removal proposal even though he had been granted an indefinite extension of time to find another position within the agency and was told that the agency would notify him when a written response to the removal proposal notice was required. The appellant stated that he requested postponement of the meeting because of his illness, lack of sleep, and need to seek medical attention but that the agency denied his request. In support of these assertions, the appellant presented affidavits from union official Jan Strickland and from Ms. Gray. The appellant also alleged that the agency had actual or constructive knowledge of the Board's stay order in his RIF appeal and used time pressure to obtain his resignation in order to avoid retaining him in his reassigned position pursuant to the stay order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the facts alleged by the appellant, if true, would establish that the settlement agreement was invalid and that his resignation procured through that settlement agreement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Riley v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 671, 677 (1992). Therefore, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal that entitles him to a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. United States Postal Service</span>, 39 MSPR 236, 238 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency has disputed the appellant's claim of involuntariness. Because, however, the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the Board may not weigh the evidence and resolve the parties' conflicting assertions, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v.

<p class="Body-Text">There is a limitation on the Board's authority under <span class="Italic">Wade</span> to consider the validity of an unfiled settlement. The Board must have jurisdiction over the appeal to consider the challenge to the settlement, meaning that an AJ may have to conduct a jurisdictional hearing to address the settlement, <span class="Italic">Evans v. Selective Service System</span>, 91 MSPR 376, 380 n.3 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement resulting in the withdrawal of an appeal, even when that agreement is not entered into the Board's record for enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Wade v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 580, 582-83 (1994). The <span class="Italic">Wade</span> principle applies if the issue of Board jurisdiction is unresolved or the Board has jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See Roberts v. Department of the Navy,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 519 (1999); <span class="Italic">Boucher v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 40 (1995); <span class="Italic">Wade,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. at 582-83. However, if, after conducting a jurisdictional hearing on remand, the administrative judge dismisses the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Board will lack authority to further address the validity of the settlement agreement. The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation<span class="Italic">. Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). "Once the Board has determined that there is no agency action over which it can exercise jurisdiction, it has no authority to make any other determinations or grant any relief." <span class="Italic">Moscato v. Department of Education,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 261, 263 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To challenge dismissal of an appeal based on an unfiled settlement, the appellant must file a PFR within the time allowed by Board regulations, or the appellant must explain to the Board's satisfaction why that time limit should be waived, <span class="Italic">Chapman v. TVA</span>, 67 MSPR 246, 249-50 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board lacks authority to enforce a settlement agreement not entered into the record for enforcement purposes. A party nonetheless may file a petition for review challenging the validity of such an agreement where it results in the withdrawal of an appeal and if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 582-83 (1994). A petition for review, however, must be filed within 35 days after the issuance of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(d). The Board will waive this time limit only upon a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, 1201.114(f). To establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that he exercised diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision dismissing the appeals as withdrawn based on the settlement agreement informed the appellant that he could file a petition for review of the initial decision no later than June 24, 1993. His challenge to the validity of that agreement, submitted to the regional office on June 11, 1994, is considered a petition for review filed with the Clerk of the Board on that date.... The petition for review therefore was filed almost one year late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a basis for waiving this untimeliness, the appellant's argument that he was unaware of the consequences of not entering the agreement into the record lacks merit. After the administrative judge advised him that the agreement would not be made part of the record for Board enforcement purposes, the appellant acknowledged those consequences by expressing his intent to pursue enforcement issues through the offices of elected officials. In any event, an appellant's claim that he was unaware that the settlement agreement did not serve his best interests does not show good cause for a delay in filing. <span class="Italic">See Malfitano v. Department of the Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 260, 262 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 94-3488, 1995 WL 7447 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 9, 1995) (Table). A claim of financial difficulties and lack of representation similarly does not excuse such a delay. <span class="Italic">See Georgeoplous v. US Postal Service</span>, 61 MSPR 411, 413 (1994). Further, the Board has held that an appellant's unfamiliarity with Board procedures does not show good cause for untimeliness. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. US Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 646, 648 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Simon v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 MSPR 176, 181 (1994) (an appellant's failure to heed notice of the actual deadline date for filing does not excuse his untimeliness). Finally, the appellant's discussion of the validity of the settlement agreement and related compliance issues does not pertain to the timeliness issue and does not establish good cause for the delay in filing. <span class="Italic">See Fritz v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force</span>, 59 MSPR 87, 90 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wade</span> overruled contrary authority in <span class="Italic">Schultze v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 250, 254-55 (1993). <span class="Italic">Schultze</span> and its antecedents had not entirely ruled out the possibility of review of the validity of an unfiled settlement, but the means of that review were indirect:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asks the Board to nullify the informal settlement agreement. The Board has no authority to invalidate a settlement agreement that has not been incorporated into the record of a Board appeal of an action over which the Board has jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Danelishen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 43 MSPR 376, 380 (1990)[5] ; <span class="Italic">Sitas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 41 MSPR 214, 216 (1989). At the appellant's request, the informal settlement agreement was not placed in the appellate record. Consequently, because we have no authority to invalidate the settlement, we decline to examine its terms. <span class="Italic">See Wexler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 513, 518 (1991) (in order to be examined by the Board, a settlement must be made a part of the record before the Board), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 954 F.2d 733 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). However, even though the Board does not have the authority to set aside a settlement agreement that is not submitted to the record for enforcement, coercion by an agency representative or administrative judge might invalidate a withdrawal of an appeal that results from such an agreement<span class="Italic">. See Cranfield v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 44 MSPR 384, 387 (1990) (alleged coercion by administrative judge); <span class="Italic">Doyle v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 566, 568 (1991) (case remanded to determine if withdrawal resulting from settlement was involuntary as a result of actions of agency representative). However, we find no ground on which to invalidate the appellant's withdrawal of her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Danelishen</span>, 43 MSPR 376 (1990), the Board found that even though it had no authority to invalidate a settlement agreement that had not been incorporated into the record, it nonetheless could examine the circumstances surrounding the settlement agreement to determine whether a basis existed for exercising Board jurisdiction over the allegedly involuntary resignation resulting from the agreement<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 380; <span class="Italic">see also Myslik v. Veterans Administration</span>, 2 MSPR 71 (1979) (a resignation found to have been forced is tantamount to a removal action and, as such, constitutes an adverse action falling within the Board's jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant acknowledges in her petition for review that the Board has no jurisdiction over the EEO action. Thus, even if we found that the appellant involuntarily withdrew her discrimination complaint, we would have no jurisdiction over such an action, standing alone<span class="Italic">. See Metzenbaum v. Department of Justice</span>, 54 MSPR 32, 37 (1992) (a claim of discrimination alone will not establish jurisdiction absent an otherwise appealable matter). Consequently, unlike <span class="Italic">Danelishen</span>, there is no basis here for examining the circumstances surrounding the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4849"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0752-15-0507-I-1 (NP 10/13/2015) ("To the extent that the appellant is attempting to repudiate the NSA, we note that the Board has no authority to enforce or invalidate a settlement agreement not incorporated into the record of a Board appeal of an action over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Danelishen v.

<p class="Body-Text">Earlier, the Board would not probe into the conditions of an unfiled settlement after the appeal was withdrawn. The settlement was treated as a contract. <span class="Italic">Clark v.
