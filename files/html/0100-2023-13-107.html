<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-106"><span class="space">7.</span> Bar Order Preventing Entry to Workplace</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Commanding officers can bar individuals from entering military establishments. Violation of the bar order may result in arrest and criminal prosecution. Exceptions to the bar may be made for limited purposes, e.g., an employee or applicant for a job who needs to meet with an EEO counselor. In <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 82 MSPR 444, 447-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9-10 (1999), appellant, a meatcutter, was accused of theft and of making a false statement during an inquiry. The employer, DCA, was a tenant entity at Fort Stewart. The Commanding General of Fort Stewart barred the appellant from the installation. Meanwhile, DCA proposed his removal. DCA informed the appellant, who inquired about his working and pay status, that he would not be paid since he could not perform work as a result of the bar order. The employee appealed a constructive suspension. The Board decided that the appellant made out a nonfrivolous case and should have been provided a hearing. DCA and Fort Stewart had agreements concerning security, and it could not be said that the decision from Fort Stewart was wholly beyond DCA's control, particularly when the appellant asserted that arrangements were previously made to allow similarly situated individuals limited access to the base:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has defined circumstances that constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated the absence and that the enforced absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Thibodeaux v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 178, 181 (1997); <span class="Italic">Dize v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 635, 639-40 (1997); <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 692 (1996). Taking guidance from <span class="Italic">Thibodeaux</span>, <span class="Italic">Dize</span> and <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, we find that the following circumstances constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that an agency initiated an employee's absence, and that the enforced absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board: (1) The employee is absent because of circumstances beyond his control; (2) he informs the agency, that, but for the circumstance beyond his control, he is ready, willing and able to work; (3) the agency is bound by agency policy, rule, regulation, contractual provision, or other authority to offer assistance to the employee with the circumstances beyond his control; and (4) the agency fails to offer the employee such assistance. <span class="Italic">See Thibodeaux</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 181; <span class="Italic">Dize</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 639-40; <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 692. <span class="Italic">See also Humphrey v. Department of the Army</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 519, 525-526 (1997) (the Board will hold agencies obligated beyond the requirements of the law to provide employees the benefits they have established by policy, rule, or regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2108"></span>Here, the appellant alleged that he was absent due to circumstances beyond his control, the bar letter, and that he informed the agency that, but for the bar letter, he was ready, willing, and able to work. He also alleged that it was common practice for affected organizations to request from the Commanding General a "limited bar" which would allow an employee in the appellant's situation the opportunity to report for work and to leave the installation by the most direct route, and that the agency failed to seek a limited bar for him. Although the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, he did not establish Board jurisdiction because he did not prove his assertion that it was common practice for affected organizations to request from the Commanding General a "limited bar" which would allow an employee in the appellant's situation the opportunity to report for work and to leave the installation by the most direct route. If the appellant can prove that there was indeed such a practice, and that the practice was mandated by a binding agency policy, rule, regulation, contractual provision, or other authority, then the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency,</span> 864 F.2d 1579, 1580-81 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (when an employee loses the security clearance that is a requirement for his position, if the agency had "an 'existing policy,' manifested by regulation," to reassign such an employee to an available non-sensitive position, the agency can "be held to that policy and the Board c[an] review its efforts").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition, the agency asserts that it is a part of the Department of Defense, and as such it is an agency separate from the Department of the Army, which issued the bar letter. It argues that, as a separate agency from the Department of the Army, it cannot be held responsible for actions taken by Fort Stewart in accordance with its own regulations. We note, however, that as a tenant agency, DCA performed certain functions in cooperation with the Department of the Army through memorandums of agreement (MOAs), memorandums of understanding (MOUs), interservice support agreements (ISAs), and other means. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> AR 405-80, Para. 4.31 (Oct. 10, 1997) (MOUs and MOAs document areas of responsibility or mutual understanding between the installation provider/host and the customer/tenant, and the requirements for recurring support are documented on ISAS). Thus, we find that, even if DCA established that it is a separate agency from the Department of the Army, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Francis v. Department of the Navy,</span> 53 MSPR 545 (1992), that fact is not dispositive of whether DCA constructively suspended the appellant under the circumstances of this appeal. Rather, the dispositive issue is whether DCA had a policy, rule, contractual provision, or regulation that obligated its cooperation with the Department of the Army to seek for the appellant a "limited bar," enabling him access to Fort Stewart so that, notwithstanding the bar letter issued by the Army Commander, the appellant could get to his job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> was applied and an AJ's finding of a constructive suspension was reversed when there was no evidence that the appellant asked the agency to help him seek a limited bar, that the agency was required to help him, and that it refused to do so, <span class="Italic">Rose v. DOD</span>, 118 MSPR 302, 303-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-14, 2012 MSPB 83 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a WG-4 Store Worker/Forklift Operator at the Department of Defense's Defense Commissary Agency (agency), which is a tenant activity of the Department of the Navy's Gulfport, Mississippi Naval Construction Battalion Center (NCBC). On June 10, 2011, NCBC Acting Commanding Officer Knudsen issued a notice, effective upon receipt, barring the appellant from entering the NCBC for "1) carrying a concealed weapon; and 2) threats of violence against persons inside the commissary." The notice informed the appellant that, if he entered, or was found in or around the NCBC, he would be in violation of the order and 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1382, and "may be subject to a fine of not more than $500.00 or imprisoned not more than six months or both." On June 11, 2011, the agency began carrying the appellant in an absence without leave (AWOL) status because of his failure to report for work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 1, 2011, the appellant filed an appeal alleging that the agency had constructively suspended him for more than 14 days. The agency moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.[1] After the appellant waived his right to a hearing, the administrative judge issued a decision on the written record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Effective October 21, 2011, the agency removed the appellant based on charges of absence from duty due to barment and AWOL. The administrative judge subsequently reversed the removal. The agency has filed a petition for review of that initial decision, and the appellant has filed a motion to join that case with this one. We DENY the motion because joinder will not expedite the processing of the cases. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.36(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the Board addressed the situation presented here--an employee being barred by one governmental entity from being able to report for duty to another governmental entity--in <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 444 (1999). He found that the Board there required an employee to prove the following four factors to prove that he was constructively suspended:[2] (1) He was absent because of circumstances beyond his control; (2) he informed the agency that, but for those circumstances, he was ready, willing, and able to work; (3) the agency was bound by agency policy, rule, regulation, contractual provision, or other authority to offer assistance to the employee with the circumstances beyond his control; and (4) the agency failed to offer such assistance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant must prove these elements to establish jurisdiction because he waived his right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">cf. Hollingsworth</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 444, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (remanding the appeal for a jurisdictional hearing and any necessary further proceedings because the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation satisfying the jurisdictional test).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant proved Board jurisdiction under the first two <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> factors. The administrative judge found that the second two <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> factors should not be applied to this appeal. He thus concluded that the appellant proved that he was constructively suspended, and he reversed the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge should have applied the test set forth in Hollingsworth, 82 M.S.P.R. 444, in adjudicating this appeal</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge should have applied all four factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> in adjudicating this appeal. The administrative judge declined to apply factors three and four, stating his view that "this aspect of the test unduly burdens the appellant and fails to give appropriate credence to the employer-employee relationship," and "ostensibly permits a tenant activity to have unfettered disciplinary authority, not subject to review," which is "against public policy." He also found that the agency is aware of the process for requesting a restrictive bar from the Commanding Officer that would allow an employee access to work and "has ready access to information about approvals and disapprovals of requests for restrictive bars." Thus, he stated his view that the agency, not the appellant, should have the burden of coming forward with such information. He reiterated that "parts 3 and 4 of the <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> test fail to give proper credence and weight to the employer-employee relationship and yield results contrary to public policy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the administrative judge should have applied all four factors. <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> is a precedential Board decision. The administrative judge acknowledged that it addressed the situation presented in this case, but simply declined to apply it. An administrative judge is bound by Board precedent and is not free to substitute his views for Board law. <span class="Italic">Cf. Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 10 n.9 (2012) (noting that the Board is bound to follow its reviewing court's precedent).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Under the Hollingsworth test, the appellant did not establish that the agency constructively suspended him</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the record does not support the administrative judge's findings concerning the first two <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> factors, i.e., that the appellant was absent due to circumstances beyond his control and that he was ready, willing, and able to work. The administrative judge found that it was entirely Knudsen's act of barring the appellant that caused his absence and that it was a matter beyond his control. The administrative judge concluded that the appellant proved the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal under the first and second <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find it unnecessary to determine whether the appellant proved that his absence was for a matter beyond his control because he did not show that he was ready, willing, and able to work, and, thus, did not satisfy the second <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> factor. The administrative judge did not cite any specific basis for finding that the appellant proved the second <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> factor. Further, although the appellant's attorney stated that the agency had denied the appellant's "request" to return to work, a representative's statements in a pleading are not evidence, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Santos v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 573, 577 (1998). In his sworn statement, the appellant did not aver that he asked to return to work, and the record contains no evidence establishing that he did so. Indeed, Knudsen's June 10, 2011 order instructed the appellant to submit a request to modify or terminate the order if he believed that any compelling reason existed that he believed would be sufficient. The appellant has presented no evidence showing that he contacted either Knudsen or the agency. Rather, the record shows only that he filed a Board appeal on July 1, 2011. Therefore, even applying only the second factor, the appellant cannot prevail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge failed to distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> in declining to apply factors three and four. The administrative judge found that every military department has a regulation that governs bars to the installation and provides for requesting a restricted bar with limited access, such as transit directly to and from the workplace. He cited the Department of the Navy's regulation as <span id="Page_2109"></span>containing a sample bar letter with the following language: "If you believe any compelling reason exists sufficient to justify modification or termination of this order, you may submit a request for consideration to my Staff Judge Advocate, at the above address." He found that "[h]ere, there is no indication that the agency informed the appellant he could make a request for a restrictive bar or made a request on his behalf." As previously noted, the administrative judge found that the agency is aware of the process of requesting a restrictive bar, and the agency has ready access to information about approvals and disapprovals of requests for such bars.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the administrative judge did not apply factors three and four of <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> because he found the <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> factors "against public policy," we agree with the agency that his finding was incorrect. As explained above, Knudsen's June 10, 2011 order contained language similar to the sample letter that the administrative judge cited, which notified the appellant that he could request termination or modification of the bar. Further, in <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span>, the Board simply found that, as a tenant agency of the Department of the Army, the agency performed certain functions in cooperation with the Department of the Army through agreements, and the fact that the agency was separate from the Department of the Army was not dispositive of whether the agency had constructively suspended the appellant. <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 444, &#x00B6; 10. Rather, the Board found that the dispositive issue was whether the agency had a policy, rule, contractual provision, or regulation that obligated its cooperation with the Department of the Army to seek a limited bar for the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It found that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing in that regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the appellant nor the administrative judge cited any evidence establishing that the appellant asked the agency to help him seek a limited bar, that the agency was required to help him, and that it refused to do so. Thus, the appellant did not show that he established factors three and four of the <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred to the extent that he found that it had taken any disciplinary action against the appellant related to the barment because its carrying of the appellant on AWOL status was not itself an appealable action. As the agency asserts, its decision to place the appellant in an AWOL status is not itself an action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 489, 491 (1988). For the reasons discussed above, we find that the appellant has failed to show that his absence was a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. Thus, we vacate the initial decision and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v. DOD,</span> AT-0752-12-0063-B-2 (NP 8/10/2015) (reversing removal based on AWOL resulting from bar order because the agency failed to supply due process in its decisional process through considerations of approaches other than removal, e.g., administrative leave or reassignment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span> was applied to support one charge of an adverse action case, <span class="Italic">McCurn v. DOD</span>, 119 MSPR 226, 238-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-26, 2013 MSPB 17 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's final pretext argument is based on a March 26, 2009 decision by the DDDSJ commander barring the appellant from the military installation "based on [his] possession of a switchblade knife and marijuana" on March 10, 2009, as he attempted to enter the base. Because he was barred from the base, the appellant was unable to report for duty and was charged with AWOL from March 27, 2009, until April 10, 2009, the date of the proposed removal. The arbitrator found that the agency, as a tenant on the military base, was subject to the security regulations and procedures of the host and had no authority to rescind the base commander's decision to bar the appellant from the facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 444, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9-11 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Defense</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 9-13 (2012), the Board addressed a situation where an employee, who worked for a tenant agency on a military base, was barred from the installation by the host entity. The Board held that, to establish that the bar was a constructive suspension (which would vitiate the AWOL charge in this case), the appellant must show that: (1) He was absent because of circumstances beyond his control; (2) he informed the agency that, but for those circumstances, he was ready, willing, and able to work; (3) the agency was bound by agency policy, rule, regulation, contractual provision, or other authority to offer assistance to the employee with the circumstances beyond his control; and (4) the agency failed to offer such assistance. <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Hollingsworth</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 444, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the arbitrator found that the appellant's employing agency, DRMS, was a tenant on DDDSJ, and the appellant does not dispute that finding. In addition, it is undisputed that the appellant was barred from DDDSJ by the military commander of that base and that the bar was outside of the appellant's control and was the reason for his absence from duty. The appellant does not allege that he informed the agency prior to his removal that, absent the bar, he was ready, willing, and able to work. Nor has the appellant pointed to anything, such as an agency policy or collective bargaining agreement provision, that obligated the agency to offer assistance in having the bar lifted or revised to allow him to return to work. Thus, the appellant has failed to establish that there was anything improper in the agency charging him with AWOL based on his failure to report for duty because of the bar issued by the DDDSJ commander. Because the appellant has failed to show that the agency's action was improper, he has not shown that it was a pretext for discrimination.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10] The arbitrator noted that the commander testified about his responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the base, and the arbitrator correctly observed that the "[p]rohibition of drugs and weapons is a security requirement." In addition, we note that the appellant has failed to submit evidence even suggesting that the commander's decision was the result of race discrimination.</p>
