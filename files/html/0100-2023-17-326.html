<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-324"><span class="space">a.</span> Critical Elements, Performance Standards</h5>
<p class="noindent">Through 1987, FLRA maintained that although a grievance challenging the application of performance standards to a particular employee did not interfere with management rights, an award entertaining challenges to the standards themselves infringed management's rights to assign work and to direct employees. <span class="Italic">SSA Office of Assessment and AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Assessment Locals</span>, 19 FLRA 246, 246-47 (1985). At the end of 1987, FLRA revised its position. <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station and AFGE Local 2221</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 626-27 (1987), involved exceptions to an award of an arbitrator who decided that he could not entertain a challenge to the grievant's performance standards and critical elements. The grievance challenged only the standards and elements, not their application. An extensive opinion, partially excerpted here, determined that an arbitrator may determine if a performance plan complies with applicable legal requirements and, if it does not, the arbitrator may direct the agency to establish a plan that meets those requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "grievance" is defined in section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute as any complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;by any labor organization concerning any matter relating to the employment of any employee; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;by any employee, labor organization, or agency concerning--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;the effect or interpretation, or a claim of breach, of a collective bargaining agreement; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Agreements that exclude from the negotiated grievance procedure only the five subjects specified in section 7121(c) are referred to as "broad scope" agreements; those that additionally exclude other subjects are "limited scope" agreements. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Locals 225, 1504, and 3723 v. FLRA</span>, 712 F.2d 640, 642 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties have the responsibility to determine the scope of their negotiated grievance procedure.&#x2003;Scope is a mandatory subject of bargaining....&#8197;If the parties do not exclude subjects from the scope of their grievance procedure, grievances regarding those subjects are within the scope, if they are not mandatorily excluded by section 7121(c) and if they meet the definition of "grievance" in the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As is evident from the wording of section 7103(a)(9), the Statute defines the term "grievance" expansively....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance in this case alleged that the grievant's performance appraisal plan containing the performance elements and standards for the grievant's position violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, FPM Chapter 430, and AFR 40-452. Therefore, the grievance clearly concerns a complaint by an employee concerning a claimed violation by management of law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute. Moreover, the grievance does not address one of the mandatorily excluded subjects in section 7121(c) of the Statute. Finally, it is clear from the record in this case that the parties did not agree to exclude the grievance from the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA observed in <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span> that the Federal Circuit and the MSPB consider arguments concerning the objectivity of performance standards in the context of employee appeals from performance based actions. Further, in <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648 (1985), the Supreme Court imposed on arbitrators the same substantive rules of decisionmaking that the MSPB would apply in civil service appeals. FLRA went on explain in <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span>, 30 FLRA at 630-38:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, it is clear that like the MSPB and the Federal Circuit, arbitrators have the power to consider whether performance standards comply with applicable legal requirements. The cases which we have discussed all arose in the context of employees' terminations or other adverse actions for performance reasons. However, that fact simply reflects the jurisdictional limitations on what sorts of cases can come before the MSPB and the Federal Circuit; it does not demonstrate that an inquiry by a third-party into the legal validity of performance standards can occur <span class="Italic">only</span> in that context.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find no provision in the Statute which would allow the question of the standards' conformity with law to be addressed only after the grievant <span class="Italic">has been</span> evaluated against the standards, as opposed to at the time the standards have been established for the employee and he or she <span class="Italic">will be</span> expected to perform under and be evaluated against those same standards. In either situation, the question is the same: whether the standards themselves comply with law....&#8197;The requirement that standards comply with law does not arise only at the time at which an employee is evaluated against those standards; the standards must comply with law at the time that management establishes them for employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The primary argument raised by the Activity and OPM...relates to the claimed interference with the exercise of management's rights if the grievance is found to be arbitrable. Relying on section 7106 of the Statute and Authority case law, the essence of the argument is the following: (1) management has the right under section 7106 to establish performance standards and critical elements for positions; (2) an arbitrator may not act in such a way as to deny management its rights under section 7106; and (3) finding a grievance which alleges that the establishment of standards and elements violates law to be arbitrable would be impermissible because an arbitrator would be substituting his or her judgment for that of management as to what the standards and elements should be....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe that this argument must be rejected because it fails to take into account the distinction between an arbitrator's decision as to the arbitrability of a grievance and an arbitrator's decision (including remedy) resolving the substantive issue presented by a grievance. In rejecting this argument, we will no longer follow certain Authority decisions in the performance standard area that, in our view, also did not properly take this distinction into account. Additionally, the argument does not explain satisfactorily why an arbitrator has the power to examine the content of standards and elements for consistency with law after an employee has had a performance-based action taken against him or her, but should not have the same authority before that point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The right of management to identify particular critical elements of positions and to establish performance standards is derived from its rights...to direct employees and to assign work in accordance with applicable laws....&#8197;The proper phase of the arbitration proceeding in which to determine the impact or application of section 7106 is not at the outset so as to preclude by law an arbitrator from having jurisdiction over the matter. Rather, the determination as to the impact or application of section 7106 is to be made in connection with the arbitrator's consideration of the substantive issue presented by the grievance and any possible remedy....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e note that the concern with arbitrators' "substituting their judgment" for that of management presents no basis on which to preclude the arbitrability of grievances challenging the legality of performance standards before an employee is evaluated against those standards. Resolution of the grievance in this case by an arbitrator would not require an arbitrator to do anything other than what arbitrators do routinely in resolving other disputes, including those involving the exercise of other management rights such as discipline. An arbitrator would simply be examining an action by management to determine whether that action was lawful; that is, whether the performance standards established by management complied with law, as it is beyond dispute that they must....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question of any impermissible arbitral interference with management's rights must be directed to the merits, including remedy, of an arbitration decision relating to performance standards' consistency with law. Although this case does not involve the merits of an award, we note the following limitations on an arbitrator's inquiry into the conformance of an employee's performance plan with applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding the merits of a grievance like the one in this case, an arbitrator may examine the performance standards and elements established by management for the grievant only in order to determine whether they comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, notably the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and 5 C.F.R. Chapter 430. If an arbitrator were to find that a grievant's performance plan did not comply with applicable legal requirements, the appropriate remedy would be for the arbitrator to direct the Agency to establish a plan which complies with applicable legal requirements. This type of remedy best effectuates Congress' dual intent that management comply with the statutory requirements and that it retain the flexibility to determine which lawful standards best serve its needs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator may not determine what the content of the employee's plan should be and may not establish new performance standards. Further, an arbitrator could not impose requirements on an agency beyond those mandated by applicable law and regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 25 FLRA 384, 394 (1987) (in which the Authority held nonnegotiable a proposal that would <span id="page_2308"></span>establish criteria governing the objectivity of performance standards and would authorize arbitrators to review whether the agency's standards complied with those criteria because the proposal was more restrictive than the requirements of law and thus did not merely implement legal requirements for the establishment of performance standards).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in our view, an arbitrator's award which addresses whether an employee's performance standards comply with applicable law should be consistent with the principles set forth in relevant MSPB and Federal Circuit cases....&#8197;We would expect parties to present relevant case law and other materials to an arbitrator to assist in the resolution of any dispute concerning this issue. Our review of exceptions to an arbitrator's award on such a matter would be limited to the narrow grounds set forth in section 7122(a) of the Statute--that is, an award would be found deficient only (1) if it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation, or (2) on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that a grievance alleging that management violated applicable law when it established a grievant's performance standards and elements, whether or not it has evaluated the grievance against the standards and elements, is arbitrable unless the parties have excluded it from the scope of their negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reaffirmed the jurisdiction of arbitrators to review standards prior to their adverse implementation. FLRA set aside an award of an arbitrator who eschewed his jurisdiction to review standards, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 858 and USDA, Fed. Crop Insurance Corp.</span>, 47 FLRA 481, 486-87 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Newark</span>, the Authority held that an arbitrator may examine the performance standards and critical elements established by management in order to determine whether they comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, particularly the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and 5 C.F.R. Chapter 430. <span class="Italic">Newark</span>, 30 FLRA at 636. Moreover, an arbitrator may make that determination regardless of whether an employee has been evaluated against the performance standards or elements in question. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 638. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Newark</span>, "[t]he requirement that standards comply with law does not arise only at the time at which an employee is evaluated against those standards; the standards must comply with law the time that management establishes them for employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 631. In this case, there was no stipulation or formulation of the issue that served to limit the Arbitrator's consideration of the EO/CR critical element to its application to a bargaining unit employee. Consequently, in denying the grievance solely because no bargaining unit employee had been evaluated against the EO/CR critical element, the Arbitrator failed to apply the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">Newark</span>, which permits an arbitrator to assess an element's compliance with law at the time of the element's establishment. The Arbitrator's conclusion that he lacked jurisdiction to assess whether the establishment of the EO/CR critical element was consistent with applicable law and regulation is contrary to Authority case law and must be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator correctly stated that he could not determine the content of established standards or establish new standards, the Arbitrator would not be required to make such a determination in resolving a grievance alleging that management established a critical element in violation of applicable law and regulation. Rather, if the Arbitrator were to find that the Agency did not comply with applicable legal requirements in establishing the EO/CR critical element, the appropriate remedy would be for the Arbitrator to direct the Agency to establish an element that did comply with applicable law and regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 636-37.

<p class="noindent">The arbitrator's review of standards are tested against law developed by the MSPB. The Board recognizes that "an agency may give content to an employee's performance standards by informing the employee of specific work requirements through other methods, including: written instructions regarding the employee's duties, evidence that an employee was informed specifically of deficiencies in his or her work and of methods by which the employee could improve his or her performance, and agency responses to an employee's questions concerning his or her performance." Board law will also be followed concerning interpretation of statutory requirements that standards be communicated to employees. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Chicago and AFGE Local 1346</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v35/35-133.html">35 FLRA 1180</a>, 1184, 1185-86 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">The standards set by the MSPB governing performance standards were summarized, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188 and Dept. of Air Force, Seymour Johnson AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 590, 591 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 requires agencies to establish performance appraisal systems that, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of performance on the basis of objective, job-related criteria. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Soc. Sec. Admin., Boston Region</span>, 48 FLRA 943, 948 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Boston</span>). To be objective, a performance standard should be "sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to its meaning and content<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Wilson v. HHS</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">Wilson</span>)). In the view of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), performance standards "may be more or less objective depending upon the job measured, but must be sufficiently specific to provide a firm benchmark toward which the employee must aim her performance." <span class="Italic">Melnick v. HUD</span>, 42 MSPB 93, 98 (1989). However, there is no requirement that standards must be quantitative or numerical, <span class="Italic">see Newark Air Force Station</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 628 (1987), and performance standards may permit subjective judgments of an employee's supervisor, <span class="Italic">see SSA, Boston</span>, 48 FLRA at 948-49.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the view of MSPB, a "performance standard that provides that only one incident of poor performance will result in an unsatisfactory rating on a job element is an absolute standard." <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 646, 651-52 (1990). Although the MSPB does not hold that absolute standards are <span class="Italic">per se </span>invalid, the MSPB does hold that "their establishment will generally constitute an abuse of discretion unless death, injury, breach of security, or great monetary loss could result from a single failure to meet the performance standard<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 652.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, after acknowledging the legal and regulatory requirements for performance standards, the Arbitrator rejected the Union's claim that the appraisal factors were invalid. He specifically found that the appraisal factors: (1) could not have been quantifiable; (2) clearly convey the requirements of the position and the standards for performance; (3) are sufficiently objective so as to permit an accurate evaluation of an employee's performance; and (4) are not subjective and vague. The Union has failed to establish otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's claim that the appraisal factors are impermissibly vague. The appraisal factors provide a firm benchmark toward which employees must aim their performance, and "most people [would] understand what they mean and what they require[.]" <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 770 F.2d at 1055. Therefore, as found by the Arbitrator, the appraisal factors are sufficiently precise and specific so as to invoke a general consensus as to their meanings. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Council 236</span>, 43 FLRA 982, 987 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson </span>and finding standards not impermissibly elusive); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1263</span>, 34 FLRA 697, 701 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson </span>and finding standard was sufficiently objective).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's claim that the appraisal factors are absolute. The Union has not demonstrated that the appraisal factors create absolute requirements. <span class="Italic">See NTEU Chapter 229</span>, 32 FLRA 826, 831 (1988) (relying on the arbitrator's finding to the contrary, the Authority rejected claim that standard was absolute). In this regard, the appraisal factors do not establish rigid guidelines where a single error or lapse results in failure to meet the standards of performance. <span class="Italic">See Evans v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 28 MSPR 366, 370 (1985). Moreover, the grievant's supervisor did not apply the appraisal factors in an absolute manner. In explaining his ratings of the grievant, he identified several incidents of the grievant failing to meet the appraisal factors, yet did not rate the grievant unsatisfactory under any of the nine factors. <span class="Italic">See Rogers v. DODDS</span>, 814 F.2d 1549, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (because the agency applied standards in a flexible manner, the court rejected the claim that the performance standards were absolute). Furthermore, the Union has not established that the grievant could not have exceeded the factors with exemplary performance. <span class="Italic">See Faust v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 29 MSPR 496, 498 (1985) (standards not absolute because employees could exceed them with exemplary performance); <span class="Italic">Stubblefield v.

<p class="noindent">One objection often lodged to an appraisal is that it (or the underlying performance standard) is too subjective. FLRA provided some indirect guidance for arbitrators in <span class="Italic">George C. Marshall Space Flight Ctr., NASA and Marshall Eng'rs and Scientists Ass'n, IFPTE</span>, 34 FLRA 348, 352-53 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the MSPB do not require that performance requirements be strictly objective and do not prohibit all subjective evaluations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the statutory terms "accurate evaluation," "objective criteria," and "to the maximum extent feasible," taken together, require performance standards to be sufficiently precise and specific so as to invoke a general consensus as to their meaning and content); <span class="Italic">Stubblefield v. Department of Commerce</span>, 28 MSPR 572, 576 (1985) (a position was not susceptible to strictly objective ratings and the performance standards were not impermissibly subjective).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's exception that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator upheld performance ratings which were impermissibly subjective. The Agency's performance appraisal system has three rating levels for each job element: exceeds, meets, and fails to meet. Written <span id="page_2309"></span>performance standards are provided for the "meets" level only. Because written standards are provided for the "meets" level only, a rating official must exercise judgment to determine whether the performance has exceeded or, conversely, failed to meet the requirements set forth in the written standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirement that rating officials exercise judgment in determining appraisal ratings does not render the Activity's appraisal system impermissibly subjective. In fact, Federal Personnel Manual Letter 430-4 recognizes that a rating official is required to exercise judgment:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If an agency's appraisal system has three performance levels and a written standard for only one level of performance for each element,...the rating official may make a judgment about an employee's performance one level above, one level below, or at the level where the standard is written without additional criteria. The judgments made by a rating official about an employee's performance one level above or one level below the written standard are considered to be within a reasonable range of accuracy and objectivity and, therefore, are consistent with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, agencies are required to establish performance appraisal systems which, to the maximum extent feasible, permit accurate evaluation of performance on the basis of objective, job-related criteria. Appraisal systems must provide for establishing performance standards, communicating to employees the established standards, and evaluating employees on them. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3615</span>, 39 FLRA 407, 411 (1991) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the award violates 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) because there were no written performance standards provided for the "outstanding" level and because the grievant's rating was impermissibly subjective. We reject these claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 does not require that written performance standards be provided for every rating level. Instead, the requirements of this provision are satisfied by communicating to employees the standards they must meet in order to be evaluated at a level sufficient for job retention. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, New Orleans, Louisiana and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1904</span>, 36 FLRA 718, 723 (1990) (<span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Melnick v. HUD</span>, 42 MSPB 93, 98 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (affirmance without opinion under Federal Rule 36); <span class="Italic">Seplavy v. VA</span>, 41 MSPB 251, 253-54 (1989). Article 21, Section 4 of the parties' agreement indicates that the performance appraisal system under which the grievant was evaluated has five rating levels for each job element and that written standards are provided for levels 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the requirement that rating officials exercise judgment in determining appraisal ratings does not render an appraisal system inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, 36 FLRA at 723-24; <span class="Italic">George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Huntsville, Alabama and Marshall Engineers and Scientists Association, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers</span>, 34 FLRA 348, 353 (1990). In particular, "judgments made by a rating official about an employee's performance one level above the written standard are considered to be within a reasonable range of accuracy and objectivity and are consistent with the requirements of section 4302(b)(1)." <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, 36 FLRA at 724. As noted, the appraisal system under which the grievant was rated provides written standards at levels 2, 3, and 4.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA occasionally gets into the business of evaluating standards because the standards are sustained or rejected in the course of an arbitration. That type of review occurred as to the objectivity of some standards (described in the FLRA opinion), in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 236 and GSA Region 9</span>, 43 FLRA 982, 986-88 (1992), determining there was no merit in union exceptions claiming that an arbitrator improperly found standards to be sufficiently specific:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, agencies are required to establish performance appraisal systems with job elements and performance standards that will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit accurate evaluation of performance on the basis of objective criteria related to the job in question....&#8197;To be objective, a performance standard should be sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to its meaning and content....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to section 4302(b)(2), an agency must, at the beginning of each appraisal period, communicate to each employee the performance standards and critical elements of the employee's position. Communication of these standards may occur in counseling sessions, in written instructions, or in any manner calculated to apprise employees of the requirements against which they will be measured....&#8197;Section 4302 does not require that written performance standards be provided for every rating level. Instead, the requirements of this provision are satisfied by communicating to employees the standards that they must meet in order to be evaluated at a level sufficient for job retention....&#8197;Moreover, a rating official may make a judgment about an employee's performance one level above the level at which a standard is written consistent with the requirements of section 4302....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Union fails to establish that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. We reject the Union's arguments that the grievant's performance plan must define levels of performance for the ratings of highly successful and outstanding, that the grievant's supervisor relied on incorrect information, and that the performance standards were impermissibly "elusive."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither section 4302 nor 5 C.F.R. part 430 precludes the Agency's use of a generic performance standard defining highly successful performance. We find that the Agency's use of a definition of highly successful performance that was set forth in the Agency's performance management handbook and had been previously used in rating the grievant as highly successful sufficiently apprised the grievant of the content of the standard for highly successful performance....&#8197;To the extent the Union contends that the plan does not define the level of performance necessary for an outstanding rating, we note that the absence of a written standard for outstanding performance is not inconsistent with section 4302. As we have repeatedly recognized, judgments made by a supervisor about a grievant's performance one level above a written standard are within the range of objectivity required by law and regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's argument that the grievant's performance standards were impermissibly subjective or elusive. In our view, the standards, including the definitions of fully successful and highly successful performance, are sufficiently precise and specific so as to invoke a general consensus as to their meanings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. HHS</span>, 770 F.2d at 1052....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he standards in this case are not "devoid of even the most general of quantitative terms such as 'usually,' 'normally,' or 'most.'"...&#8197;For example, under critical elements 1 and 2, the grievant is expected generally to complete typing "within the same day or the following day after assignment[,]" to answer telephones "promptly," and to file material "within 5 days after receipt...." Read in conjunction with the critical elements, the Agency's generic performance standards are sufficiently precise and specific to apprise the grievant of objective standards that she must meet. Thus, in order to be rated fully successful, the grievant's "pattern of performance [must] consistently [have] met the standard for expected performance, on balance." And, as relevant to this grievance, in order to have been rated highly successful, the grievant's "pattern of performance throughout the rating period clearly [must have] exceeded the standard for expected performance more often than not and rarely or never failed to meet the standard."</p>

However, the Arbitrator did not expressly conclude that the standard was valid. Accordingly, it is unclear whether the Arbitrator found it unnecessary to consider the validity of the performance standard because the grievance did not concern a removal or whether the Arbitrator concluded that the standard would be invalid in the context of a removal proceeding but was not in the case before him. With respect to the latter point, we are aware of no basis, and none is asserted, on which to conclude that an otherwise invalid performance standard is rendered valid if its application does not result in a removal. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 28 MSPR at 231 (MSPB held that "the requirement of near perfection" failed to "provide a reasonable basis for rewarding an employee[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent">An award may not require negotiation of performance standards or changes in the standards. That would infringe on the management right to establish standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2014 and SSA</span>, 21 FLRA 991, 995 (1986). Yet FLRA sustained an award striking standards because of an inadequate opportunity for the employee to comment on the standards. Although FLRA cast its decision in terms of the adequacy of a period for comment, what the arbitrator really did was to strike the standards because the supervisors did not fairly consider the employee's comments, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 46 FLRA 3, 3-8 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator ordered the Agency to strike a rating on a certain performance element of the grievant's annual performance evaluation because the Agency had not encouraged employee participation in establishing the performance standards for that element. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Agency's exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient. Accordingly, we will deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance contesting an employee's rating of "needs improvement" on a non-critical element of her performance evaluation. The Union challenged the rating on, among other grounds, the basis that "[n]o union or employee input went into formulation of the standards." The Union sought to have the grievant's rating on the disputed element stricken, or, in the alternative, changed from "needs improvement" to "meets[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Arbitrator found that the disputed performance elements and standards "were prepared by [three supervisors] at a weekend retreat." The Arbitrator also found that although the grievant was "shown the proposed standards" and submitted comments on them "management made no substantive changes[,]" on the standards but returned the grievant's submissions "with some snide comments."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Arbitrator, the evidence failed to show that "management encouraged employee participation[&#8197;]" as "there was a perfunctory comment opportunity, and no give and take." The Arbitrator concluded that, by failing to encourage employee participation in the establishment of the standards, the Agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(c), and the parties' collective bargaining agreement. As his award, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance and ordered the Agency to strike the disputed element from the grievant's performance rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, the Agency has the right to identify critical elements and to establish the contents of performance standards in accordance with applicable law....&#8197;An arbitrator may examine the performance standards and elements established by management for a grievant in order to determine whether they comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and 5 CFR Chapter 430. <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2221</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 636 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this respect, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a) obligates agencies to encourage employee participation in the development of their performance standards. Further, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(c), which implements 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a), provides that agencies may encourage employee participation in the establishment of performance plans in a number of ways. Among the ways suggested, the regulation provides that agencies can encourage employee participation by submitting draft performance plans to employees and providing them an opportunity to comment on the plans. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(c)(3). In this case, it is undisputed that the proposed standards were prepared by the supervisors, that they were given to the affected employees, that comments by the employees were submitted to supervisors, and that the comments were evaluated by the Agency. This process clearly is encompassed by the applicable regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Arbitrator also found that the comment period provided by the Agency was "perfunctory." In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the process used by the Agency did not encompass "give and take" between the grievant and his supervisor. The Arbitrator also found that the grievant's supervisor made "snide" comments regarding the grievant's suggested changes. The Agency does not dispute these findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In effect, the Arbitrator concluded that the comment period provided by the Agency was inadequate to satisfy the Agency's statutory and regulatory obligations. In view of the Arbitrator's findings, we agree. In particular, we find no basis on which to conclude that applicable law and regulation permit the Agency to satisfy its obligation to encourage employee participation in the establishment of performance standards through the use of a comment period such as that involved in this case. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's exception that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Agency did not establish the disputed element in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a)(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(c)(3). In view of this arbitral finding, the award striking the disputed element is not inconsistent with management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Bd. of Veterans Appeals and AFGE Local 17</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-079.html">61 FLRA 422</a>, 424 (2005), the agency negotiated an agreement that resulted in what amounted to a limitation on the use of a numerical production standard for attorneys in the unit. An arbitrator enforced the agreement, but FLRA set aside the award. FLRA treated the contract as an arrangement negotiated to limit the impact of the exercise of management rights, but FLRA determined that the negotiated arrangement concerning the performance standards excessively interfered with the exercise of those rights:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the parties signed an MOU from which a Performance Plan for the rating of attorneys was developed.&#x2003;The Arbitrator also found that the parties subsequently executed a master agreement, with Article 43, Section 1 of the master agreement providing that local agreements in existence prior to the master agreement "'will continue in effect insofar as they do not conflict with the [m]aster [a]greement.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the above, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had entered into an enforceable agreement addressing the substantive content of performance standards. In that regard, the Arbitrator found that the MOU "clearly establishes that the [p]arties reached a mutual agreement that counsel may not be rated on the basis of a numerical production standard."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Agency's management's rights arguments, the Arbitrator found that the cases cited by the Agency for the proposition that critical elements and performance standards are not mandatorily bargainable deal only with management's lack of a duty to bargain over such proposals and do not deal with matters already agreed to by the parties. The Arbitrator determined that the Agency had entered into the MOU "with full knowledge of its own rights and bargaining responsibilities." The Arbitrator found that the plain language of the MOU "allows for no other interpretation than that employees will not be rated on the number of decisions completed." As such, the Arbitrator further found that the Agency should not be "relieved of the unwelcome result of its purposeful choice in agreeing to the MOU, on the grounds that what it agreed to was a matter of management's rights outside its duty to bargain."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award abrogates the Agency's &#x00A7; 7106 rights to direct employees and to assign work. We will analyze the Agency's "abrogates" argument as an assertion that the award is contrary to law because the award excessively interferes with the Agency's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2311"></span>As the Agency asserts that the award violates management's rights, the Authority first determines whether the award affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin</span>., 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If the award affects a management right, the Authority assesses the legality of the award under the analytical framework developed in<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Washington, D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>), and which the Authority developed in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 494 U.S. 922.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's rights to direct employees and to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute encompass the authority to identify critical elements of performance and to establish performance standards. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 2096</span>, 36 FLRA 834, 845 (1990) (<span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2096</span>). An award that restricts an agency's authority to determine the content of performance standards and critical elements affects management's rights to direct employees and to assign work. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA 964, 974-75 (1991); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2096</span>, 36 FLRA at 845.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the parties had entered into an MOU which provided that employees will not be rated on the number of decisions completed, and negotiated a master agreement provision (Article 26, Section 2) which required the Performance Appraisal System to be "fair, equitable, and solely relate[d] to job performance." The Arbitrator further found that the fair share program violated the MOU and the master agreement, and required the Agency to discontinue use of the fair share production performance standard. In this regard, the Arbitrator's award restricts the Agency's ability to establish a particular performance standard and, therefore, affects management's rights to direct employees and to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. Accordingly, we apply the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 151-54.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority must first determine whether the MOU and Article 26, Section 2 were negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Def. Logistics Agency, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Tex</span>., 55 FLRA 523, 526 (1999). In order to determine whether a provision, as interpreted and applied by the arbitrator, was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), as the Union here alleges, the Authority assesses, pursuant to the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">BOP Oklahoma City</span>, whether the collective bargaining provision: (1) constitutes an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3); and (2) excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla</span>., 58 FLRA 291, 293 (2003); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Sheridan, Or.</span>, 58 FLRA 279, 282 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A collective bargaining provision constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute if it is intended to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Fed. Aviation Admin., Washington, D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 1233, 1236-37 (2000). In this case, the MOU provides that employees' performance would not be evaluated on the number of decisions completed because such a numeric total would not fairly evaluate all of the work produced by the employees. In this regard, the Arbitrator found plausible the conclusion that the fair share performance standard would improperly fail to consider the many other tasks performed by the affected employees. Also, Article 26, Section 2 of the parties' master agreement requires that the performance appraisal system be fair, equitable, and solely related to job performance. In this connection, the Arbitrator concluded that the fair share performance standard would not take into consideration the fact that employees' cases are not of equal length or complexity and, therefore, are not equal in time-consumption or difficulty. Thus, we find that the MOU's ban on numeric production performance standards, and Article 26, Section 2's requirement for a fair performance system, constitute arrangements because they are intended to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A provision excessively interferes with a management right if the benefits afforded employees under the provision are outweighed by the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">BOP Oklahoma City</span>, 58 FLRA at 111. Here, the MOU benefits employees by ensuring that lengthy and complex cases worked on by the employees are not credited equally with shorter, simpler cases, and Article 26, Section 2 of the master agreement requires that the performance appraisal system be fair, equitable and solely related to job performance. However, the MOU and Article 26, Section 2 also severely restrict the Agency's ability to direct employees and assign work. In fact, these provisions completely preclude the Agency from establishing the performance standards it wishes to use to assess its employees' performance. We conclude that this complete preclusion of the Agency's proposed performance standards outweighs the benefits to employees established by the MOU and Article 26, Section 2. Accordingly, we find that the award excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. Thus, the award must be set aside. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 2139</span>, 57 FLRA 292, 294 (2001) (proposal that precluded agency's proposed establishment of criteria governing employee performance (which includes performance standards) excessively interfered with rights to assign work and direct employees); <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n,</span> 48 FLRA 129, 138 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 47 F.3d 1217 (D.C.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals and Dept. of Labor, Philadelphia</span>, 60 FLRA 241, 243-44 (2004), declined to set aside the award determining that standards were adequately communicated by management and that supervisors did not require a particular level of expertise to apply or explain the standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 requires agencies to establish performance appraisal systems that, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of performance on the basis of objective, job-related criteria. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council 236</span>, 43 FLRA 982, 986 (1992). In addition, appraisal systems must provide for communicating performance standards to employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(2). The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) has held that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 are satisfied by communicating to employees the standards they must meet in order to be evaluated at a level sufficient for job retention. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Melnick v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 42 MSPR 93, 98 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Such communication may occur through written instructions, information concerning deficiencies and methods of improving performance, responses to the employee's questions concerning performance, or in any manner calculated to apprise the employee of the requirements against which he is to be measured. <span class="Italic">See Chaggaris v. General Services Admin., </span>49 MSPR 249, 254 (1991); <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 293, 298 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DPR 430 similarly provides for communicating standards to employees and permitting employees to comment on the standards.&#x2003;Thus, DPR 430(5)(a) states that "[p]erformance plans...will be...communicated to the employee at the beginning of each appraisal period...." DPR 430(5)(b) provides that "the employee will have the opportunity to meet and discuss [proposed] standards with the supervisor, and to provide his or her written comments."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Union has not established that the award is contrary to law or regulation.&#x2003;First, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 does not require that supervisors have a particular level of knowledge and expertise as to the rationale behind performance elements, or that the employees be advised as to how to exceed the standards. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 requires only that the employees be apprised of the requirements against which they are to be measured. The Arbitrator here found that the standards were provided to employees and were given an opportunity to comment on the standards. The Arbitrator further found that provisions of the parties' agreement and the MOU address concerns about how employees can meet or exceed the standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the same reason, we find that the Union has not established that the award is contrary to the provisions of DPR 430 cited above. There is no evidence that supervisors were unable or failed to meet and discuss the standards with employees or to properly include employees in the development of the standards. Further, as to the claimed violation of DRP 430(2), the Union has not offered any explanation of how the award is in conflict with this definitional section of the regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">A rating may be canceled at the direction of an arbitrator for reasons relating to the formation rather than the application of the governing performance standards. FLRA sustained an award canceling a rating because the grievant had not participated in discussions concerning the establishment of critical job elements. Those discussions were required by a memorandum of understanding between the parties. The arbitrator properly concluded that the agency did not properly apply the performance standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2814 and Dept. of Transp., Fed. R.R. Admin.</span>, 43 FLRA 624, 630-31 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, Farm Serv. Agency and NTEU Chap. 264</span>, 55 FLRA 1060, 1062-63 (1999) (arbitrator properly directed agency to upgrade appraisal when employee was not advised, as required by contract, of changes in standards; but for improper changes in standards, grievant's rating would have been higher).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-45 and DCA, Langley AFB</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-134.html">55 FLRA 789</a>, 794-95 (1999), the arbitrator properly amended his award to direct that the parties follow contract provisions requiring the agency to discuss with employees, with the assistance of the union, the performance plans used to rate employees at the levels of "excellent" and "outstanding":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award is deficient if it is inconsistent with a "governing" agency regulation. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department Of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, Fort Campbell District, Third Region, Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022, </span>37 FLRA 186, 192 (1990). However, collective bargaining agreements, rather than agency-wide regulations, govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Naval Training Center,</span> <span class="Italic">Orlando, Florida and International Union of Operating</span> <span class="Italic">Engineers, Local 673, </span>53 FLRA 103, 108-109 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no merit to the Agency's contention that the remedy violates the Agency's performance appraisal regulations by requiring the Agency to establish written performance standards for all levels of performance. The <span id="page_2312"></span>Arbitrator based his award on Article 41, Sections 1 and 4 of the parties' agreement, provisions that he found applicable to the instant dispute. Even assuming that an agency regulation is relevant to the instant dispute, the collective bargaining agreement governs the disposition of this matter. In any event, no regulatory provision is cited by the Agency that prohibited the Arbitrator from enforcing the collective bargaining agreement by ordering the Agency to involve employees in developing performance plans to be used on an objective basis for overall summary ratings of "excellent" and "outstanding."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Contrary to the Agency's claim, the Arbitrator did not add to the language of Article 41 of the collective bargaining agreement by requiring the Agency to establish written performance standards with Union and employee assistance. To remedy the violation of the agreement, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to "discuss and prepare, with the assistance of the Union and Sales Store Checker members Performance Plans" to be used on an objective basis for overall summary ratings of "excellent" and "outstanding." Amended Award. The collective bargaining agreement calls for the Agency to encourage the participation of employees in the development of performance plans. The remedy does not require the Agency to negotiate over the establishment of performance standards, so requiring discussion to remedy a violation of Article 41 does not "add" to the collective bargaining agreement. In these circumstances, the Authority defers to the Arbitrator's interpretation and application of the parties' agreement. Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that the remedy fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the remedy allows the Union and employees to have an "active say" in defining performance standards and that defining performance standards is solely a management right under section 7106 of the Statute. Management's identification of critical job elements and establishment of performance standards constitutes the exercise of the rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">E.g., Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, </span>30 FLRA 1156, 1158 (1988). Arbitration awards that determine the content of established performance standards or establish new standards affect management's rights to identify elements and establish standards and are contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the remedy does not prescribe the content of established performance standards nor does it require new standards. In this regard, the Agency is not required to negotiate over the content of the performance standards. The remedy only requires the Agency to "comply with the labor agreement" which calls for the encouragement of the participation of employees in the development of performance plans. Further, the award requires the Agency to "discuss and prepare [performance plans for excellent and outstanding summary ratings], with the assistance of the Union and its Sales Store Checker members." This language does not negate the express reservation of management's rights in Article 41, which states that "[t]he Employer retains final decision authority in the establishment of critical elements and performance standards[.]" Thus, the remedy does not affect the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
