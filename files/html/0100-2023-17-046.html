<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-46"><span class="space">C.</span> STATUTORY APPEAL NOT AVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES</h3>
<p class="noindent">The only award beyond the reach of exceptions with FLRA is that relating to matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f)-matters covered by 5 USC 4303 and 5 USC 7512 and similar matters under other personnel systems. An award pertaining to the suspension and removal of an employee in the excepted service who did not meet the definition under the then-controlling statute as an "employee" did not relate to any of the matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) and was properly reviewed by FLRA. <span class="Italic">Soldiers' and Airmen's Home and AFGE Local 3090</span>, 11 FLRA 692, 692 n.* (1983) (decision preceded 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments that provided appeal rights to many excepted service personnel with more than two years of continuous service).FLRA reaffirmed in <span id="page_1759"></span><span class="Italic">Soldiers' and Airmen's Home</span> in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 32 FLRA 79, 83-86 (1988), that under the law then prevailing it had jurisdiction to resolve exceptions as to employees in the excepted service (a result that may be altered following enactment of legislation in 1990 granting statutory appeal rights to some excepted service employees):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that we have jurisdiction to resolve the agency's exceptions to the award to the extent that the award applies to individuals who are not employees within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. The matters described in section 7121(f) of the Statute include matters similar to those covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, such as furlough for 30 days or less, which arise under other personnel systems. We conclude that excepted service employees who are not employees within the meaning of section 7511 are not covered by another personnel system within the meaning of section 7121(f), but rather are part of the general Federal civil service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of the Statute provides one specific example of "[an]other personnel system." In explaining the meaning of the term "other personnel system" in section 7121(e), the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee used as an example the personnel system established by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104-4119 for Department of Medicine and Surgery professional employees of the Veterans Administration....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act (the Act), 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 901-907, constitutes a "personnel system" within the meaning of section 7121(f) for teachers in schools operated by the Department of Defense in an overseas area for dependents of members of the Armed Forces and dependents of civilian employees of the Department of Defense....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no indication in the Statute or the legislative history that Congress intended the personnel provisions applicable to the excepted service to be "another personnel system" or to distinguish it from the general Federal civil service. Rather, excepted service employees are a category of Federal civil service employees. The excepted service consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 108 S. Ct. 668, 679 (1988)....&#8197;Congress specifically provided that selection for appointment to an excepted service position is to be in the same manner and under the same conditions as are required for appointment to the competitive service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320. Moreover, one class of excepted service employees, preference eligible employees, is treated as if they were in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that excepted service employees are not covered by "another personnel system"...but rather are a category of employees within the general Federal civil service. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to review exceptions to the Arbitrator's award to the extent that it applies to excepted service employees who are not employees within the meaning of section 7511.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same reasoning was applied to allow FLRA to review exceptions to an award treating removal of a temporary employee, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Reserve Personnel Ctr. and AFGE Local 900</span>, 34 FLRA 319, 320-21 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue of the Authority's jurisdiction in this case has not been raised by the parties. However, because the Authority does not have jurisdiction to review arbitration awards which involve removals of "employees," as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7511, we find it appropriate to discuss our jurisdiction in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7122(a) of the Statute, exceptions may not be filed with the Authority to an arbitration award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of the Statute. The matters described in section 7121(f) include adverse actions under 5 U.S.C. 7512, such as removals, that have been taken against employees, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7511.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant was not an employee, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7511, because she was a temporary employee whose appointment was limited to 1 year or less. Because the grievant was not an employee, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7511, her termination was not an adverse action covered by 5 U.S.C. 7512. <span class="Italic">See Horner v. Lucas</span>, 832 F.2d 596, 597 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Compton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 402 (1986). Therefore, the award does not relate to a matter described in section 7121(f) of the Statute, and the Union's exception to the award was properly filed with the Authority under section 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SBA and Local 2532 of Nat'l Council of SBA Locals, AFGE</span>, 33 FLRA 28, 33-36 (1988), also determined that FLRA had jurisdiction to review exceptions to award involving termination of a temporary employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the Agency's second argument in support of its claim that the Authority lacks jurisdiction in this case. The Agency argues that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.3(b)(3) the Authority will not review an exception to an arbitrator's award which concerns matters similar to those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 which arise under other personnel systems. According to the Agency, temporary limited employees have "such limited rights that they are not expressly covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 relating to actions based on unacceptable performance." Opposition at 13. Rather, the Agency argues such employees are covered by the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), which provides that temporary limited employees "may be separated at any time upon notice in writing from an appointing officer." FPM Chapter 316, subchapter 4-2(3). Thus, the Agency contends that because the termination of the grievant for unacceptable performance is a matter which arises under another personnel system and is similar to matters covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to decide the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency's arguments to be misplaced and that we have jurisdiction to decide this case. Section 7122(a) of the Statute provides as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of this title).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The matters described in section 7121(f) of the Statute include matters arising under other personnel systems--such as actions based on unacceptable performance--which are similar to actions based on unacceptable performance covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(f) does not define the term "other personnel systems." The legislative history of the Statute, however, provides one specific example of "another personnel system." In explaining the meaning of the term "other personnel system" in section 7121(e), the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee used as an example the personnel system established by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4104-4119 for Department of Medicine and Surgery (DM&#x0026;S) professional employees of the Veterans Administration (VA). S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 110 (1978). <span class="Italic">See also Veterans Administration Medical Center, Northport, New York v. FLRA</span>, 732 F.2d 1128 (2d Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Northport</span>, the Court gave examples of the specific personnel system established by Congress for DM&#x0026;S employees. These include: (1) qualifications for DM&#x0026;S professionals are determined by the VA "without regard to civil service requirements," citing 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4105(a), 4106(a); (2) DM&#x0026;S employees have a different probationary period than other civil service employees, <span class="Italic">citing</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(b); (3) DM&#x0026;S employees' hours, conditions of employment and leaves of absence are determined by the Administrator of the VA "notwithstanding any law, Executive order or regulation," citing 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4108(a); (4) DM&#x0026;S employees are paid according to special grades and scales, citing 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4107; and (5) DM&#x0026;S employees charged with "inaptitude, inefficiency or misconduct" are judged by peer review boards whose decision is final, <span class="Italic">citing</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110. 732 F.2d 1130 n.4, 1131.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Authority has found that the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act (the Act), 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 901-907, constitutes a "personnel system" within the meaning of section 7121(f). That Act applies to teachers in schools operated by the Department of Defense in an overseas area for dependents of members of the Armed Forces and dependents of civilian employees of the <span class="Italic">Department of Defense. Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS), Pacific Region and Overseas Education Association (OEA</span>), 22 FLRA 597, 599 (1986) (<span class="Italic">DoDDS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded in <span class="Italic">DoDDs</span> that the Act established another personnel system because the purpose of the Act was "to no longer generally subject such teachers to civil service laws and regulations as the source of their personnel system and instead to have the Secretary of Defense prescribe and issue regulations to provide for a system of personnel administration." 22 FLRA at 600. The Authority noted that under 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 902(a), the regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of Defense shall govern: (1) the establishment of teaching positions; (2) the fixing of basic compensation for teachers and teaching positions; (3) the entitlement of teachers to compensation; (4) the payment of compensation to teachers; (5) the appointment of teachers; (6) the conditions of employment of teachers; (7) the length of the school year; (8) the leave system for teachers; (9) quarters, allowances, and additional compensation for teachers; and (10) such other matters as may be relevant and appropriate to the purposes of Chapter 20. 22 FLRA at 600.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each of the two personnel systems described above is established by statute and is intended to operate apart from the personnel system which is applicable to general Federal Civil Service employees and which is governed by title 5 of the United States Code.&#x2003;In this case, however, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that temporary employees in the Agency are covered by a personnel system different from that governed by title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that the grievant occupied a competitive service position, albeit only for a period of time not to exceed 1 year. Employees, such as the grievant, who have temporary limited civil service appointments not to exceed 1 year have limited rights when terminated for cause. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Chapter 316, subchapter 4-2(3) which provides that: "Temporary limited employees may be separated at any time upon notice in writing from an appointing officer." Further, employees appointed to <span id="page_1760"></span>positions for a period of time not to exceed 1 year may also be excluded from other personnel matters governed by title 5 of the United States Code, such as coverage under the Civil Service Retirement System, due to the limited length of their appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, while temporary employees may be excluded from coverage under specified personnel matters governed by title 5 of the United States Code due to the limited length of their appointments, this fact does not establish that temporary employees are covered by another personnel system as that term is used in section 7121(f) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 32 FLRA 79 (1988) where we found that excepted service employees are not covered by "[an]other personnel system" within the meaning of section 7121(f) of the Statute even though such excepted service employees were excluded from coverage under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 relating to adverse actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, temporary employees are not covered by "another personnel system" within the meaning of section 7121(f). Rather, like excepted service employees, temporary employees are a category of employees within the general Federal Civil Service who have some different rights and benefits due to the limited nature of their appointments. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to review the merits of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA had jurisdiction to review exceptions to an award setting aside, for lack of due process, the separation of an employee at the conclusion of a two-year limited appointment. The expiration of an appointment is not a matter within the MSPB's jurisdiction, so an award concerning termination of that appointment was not precluded from review, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 68 FLRA 927, 927-28 (2015) (Member Pizzella concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) provides, in pertinent part: "Either party to arbitration under [the Statute] may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in [&#x00A7;] 7121(f) of [the Statute])."[2] The matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) are "those matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 and similar matters that arise under other personnel systems."[3] As relevant here, the matters covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 include removals.[4]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency asserted that the Authority has jurisdiction to review this case because "the grievant's claim does not concern a 'removal' appealable to the [Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)] under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512." Specifically, the Agency argued that the expiration of a term appointment is not an adverse action that is appealable to the MSPB, and whether the grievant is an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) who has completed a probationary period is irrelevant to determining whether the expiration of a term appointment is appealable. The Agency, however, cited no Authority precedent in its exceptions to support its claim that the Authority has jurisdiction over a removal based upon the expiration of a term appointment. As such, the Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication (CIP) issued an order directing the Agency to show cause why the Authority should not dismiss its exceptions for lack of jurisdiction. The Agency filed a timely response to this order. The order also offered the Union an opportunity to respond to the Agency's response, but the Union did not file a response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its response to CIP's order, the Agency cited <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>[7] to demonstrate that the Authority has jurisdiction to review the Agency's exceptions. In that case, the grievant was hired for a term appointment not to exceed a certain date.[8] After the grievant's employment ended on the expiration date of his term appointment, the union filed a grievance and the parties proceeded to arbitration.[9] When the agency filed exceptions to the arbitrator's award, the union argued that the Authority lacked jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute because the arbitrator's award related to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute--specifically, a removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512.[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority held that the expiration of the grievant's appointment did not constitute a removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512, and therefore did not dismiss the agency's exceptions for lack of jurisdiction.[11] In doing so, the Authority noted that "[r]egulations specifically exclude from the coverage of the actions set forth in [&#x00A7;&#x00A7;] 4303 and 7512 the termination of an appointment on an expiration date if the date was specified as a condition of employment at the time the appointment was made."[12]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span> that it has jurisdiction to review exceptions concerning the expiration of a term appointment, we find that the Agency has demonstrated that its exceptions are properly before us.</p>
