<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-51"><span class="space">e.</span>Jurisdiction: <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Command</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Through 2022, FLRA considered interlocutory exceptions from rulings on procedural issues that had an outcome-determinative effect under a contract, e.g., the timeliness of a grievance, the proper level that the grievance should be presented, whether arbitration was timely invoked or a hearing was held by a contractual deadline. Determining that its approach was wrong, inconsistent with treatment of challenges to arbitration in the private sector, FLRA changed its tack, deciding that it would only consider interlocutory exceptions on rulings that resolved jurisdictional challenges under the FLMRS to the grievance. The review of jurisdictional issues--whether an arbitrator is legally barred from hearing a grievance in the first place--is <span class="Italic">de novo,</span> without deference to the arbitrator's legal interpretation. And the exception will be considered only where an excepting party has demonstrated that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law; "It will not be sufficient to merely allege, or even present a 'plausible' claim, regarding legal bars to jurisdiction." As a matter of law, statutory jurisdictional challenges should not be many. 5 USC 7121(c) rules out coverage by grievance procedures of: Hatch Act matters; disputes over retirement, life insurance, or health insurance; national security suspensions or removals; examinations, certifications, or appointments (as in probationary terminations); and classification of a position that does not result in reduction in grade or pay. Jurisdictional issues will likely include employee status (e.g. whether the grievant is really a bargaining unit employee) or whether a statutory remedial election precludes a grievance. The definition of "grievance" is broadly stated under 5 USC 7103(a)(9); the statutory exceptions under 5 USC 7121(c) are narrowly confined. (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, and AFGE Local 2018,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-74.html">73 FLRA 379</a> (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting in part), will reduce disputes over what are, or are not, nongrievable classification matters rather than disputes legitimately resolved under the grievance process concerning temporary promotions.) [Refer in this chapter to the section on "Temporary Promotions."] The decision limiting availability of interlocutory exceptions, <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Command, Redstone Arsenal and NFFE Local 1332</span>, 73 FLRA 356, 356-62 (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting), had the purpose and will have the effect of reducing the number of interlocutory exceptions. FLRA determined it will only consider interlocutory exceptions when the excepting party demonstrates both that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law and resolving the exceptions would bring to an end the entire disputed submitted by the parties to arbitration. The review of jurisdictional issues--whether an arbitrator is legally barred from hearing a grievance in the first place--is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, without deference to the arbitrator's interpretation. And the exception will be considered only where an excepting party demonstrates that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law; "It will not be sufficient to merely allege, or even present a 'plausible' claim, regarding legal bars to jurisdiction":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we revisit the Authority's standard regarding review of interlocutory exceptions to arbitration awards. We now clarify that such review is warranted only when the excepting party demonstrates <span class="Italic">both</span> that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law <span class="Italic">and</span> that resolving the exceptions would bring an end to the entire dispute that the parties submitted to arbitration. In so holding, we reverse the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS</span> (<span class="Italic">IRS II</span>)[1] and any other Authority precedent that conflicts with this revised standard. Finally, applying the revised standard, we dismiss the Agency's exceptions without prejudice.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;70 FLRA 806 (2018) (then-Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Interim Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance alleging the Agency violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), other relevant law and regulations, and the parties' <span id="page_1787"></span>agreement by failing to properly classify employees under the FLSA. As a remedy, the grievance sought that the employees be made whole, with retroactive overtime, and other relief under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance went to arbitration. Before hearing the merits, the Arbitrator agreed to decide threshold arbitrability questions raised by the Agency, and framed the issue as whether the grievance was "procedurally inarbitrable." As relevant here, the Arbitrator concluded the Agency failed to establish that the Union did not follow Article 35, Section P's procedural requirements, and therefore, the grievance was arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concedes that its exceptions are interlocutory. However, the Agency asserts extraordinary circumstances warrant review because resolution of the Agency's essence exceptions could obviate the need for further arbitral proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations pertinently provides that the Authority "ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." In the arbitration context, this means that the Authority ordinarily will not resolve exceptions to an arbitrator's award unless the award completely resolves all of the issues submitted to arbitration.[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, over time, the Authority has developed exceptions to this general rule. First, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS, Los Angeles District</span> (<span class="Italic">IRS I</span>),[7] the Authority acknowledged that &#x00A7; 2429.11 "reflects the judicial policy of discouraging fragmentary appeals of the same case," but also said that this judicial policy "is not without exceptions."[8] "For example," the Authority stated, "the judicial procedure for the U.S. courts of appeals permits a departure from this policy for certain cases that involve a controlling question of law and where an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."[9] For support, the Authority cited 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1292(b), which concerns interlocutory appeals from U.S. district courts to U.S. courts of appeals.[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In sum, over time, the Authority has changed the level of proof required to warrant interlocutory review. However, starting with <span class="Italic">IRS I</span>, the Authority asked the same basic, general questions: Is there some jurisdictional bar (whether actual, plausible, or merely alleged) that precluded the arbitrator from hearing the grievance, and would resolving the interlocutory exceptions advance the case's ultimate disposition?[28]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, XVIII Airborne Corps &#x0026; Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, N.C.</span>, 70 FLRA 172, 173 (2017) (<span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>) ("the Authority will review interlocutory exceptions that allege a plausible jurisdictional defect--that the arbitrator did not have the power to issue the award as a matter of law--if addressing that defect will advance the ultimate disposition of the case by ending the litigation"); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, White Sands Missile Range, White Sands Missile Range, N.M</span>., 67 FLRA 1, 2-3 (2012) (<span class="Italic">White Sands</span>) ("Extraordinary circumstances have been found by the Authority only in situations in which a party raised a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case. Exceptions raise a plausible jurisdictional defect when they present a credible claim that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter as a matter of law.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing those questions, the Authority would find a plausible jurisdictional defect only when the exceptions challenged the arbitrator's <span class="Italic">jurisdiction as a matter of law</span>.[29] This was distinct from cases where a party alleged that the arbitrator's award was contrary to law, which did not warrant interlocutory review.[30] It also was distinct from cases where a party relied on <span class="Italic">contractual</span> limitations to an arbitrator's jurisdiction--which also did not warrant interlocutory review.[31]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, even where an arbitrator allegedly lacked jurisdiction as a matter of law, the Authority would dismiss interlocutory exceptions if resolving them would not advance the ultimate disposition of the case.[32] The Authority described this situation as one in which resolving the exceptions would end the litigation.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">After applying these basic standards for nearly thirty years, the Authority significantly changed course in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>.[34] In <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, the Authority stated that it "agree[d] with" the "longstanding judicial policy [that] discourages fragmenting appeals of the same case."[35] However, the Authority stated it "d[id] not agree that only exceptions which raise a 'plausible jurisdictional defect' present extraordinary circumstances which warrant review" of interlocutory exceptions.[36] Rather, citing only Congress' expressed, general intent that the Statute "should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government,"[37] the Authority eliminated the jurisdictional component of the interlocutory-review exception. Specifically, the Authority stated that "any exception which advances the ultimate disposition of a case--by obviating the need for further arbitral proceedings--presents an extraordinary circumstance which warrants [interlocutory] review."[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying that standard, the Authority in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> found that the Arbitrator's failure to dismiss the grievance as untimely, under the time limits contained in the parties' collective-bargaining agreement, failed to draw its essence from that agreement.[39] Consequently, the Authority set aside the arbitrator's award.[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In establishing the new standard in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, the Authority did not address whether that standard was consistent with private-sector precedent. However, the Authority recently has been admonished not to depart from private-sector arbitration principles, at least where the Statute does not provide a basis for doing so.[41] Thus, we must either apply private-sector arbitration principles or explain why the Statute warrants a departure from those principles.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[41]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Nat'l Weather Serv. Emps. Org. v. FLRA</span>, 966 F.3d 875, 881 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">With one exception discussed further below, we find no indication in the Statute that the Authority should depart from private-sector principles regarding interlocutory review of arbitration awards.[42] In fact, if anything, the Statute provides <span class="Italic">additional</span> support for applying those principles. In the private sector, courts are tasked with resolving substantive-arbitrability questions, absent the parties' agreement to submit those questions to arbitration.[43] However, under &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) of the Statute, negotiated grievance procedures--which parties <span class="Italic">must</span> include in their agreements, along with binding arbitration for unresolved grievances[44]--"<span class="Italic">shall</span> provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability."[45] In other words, while private-sector precedent <span class="Italic">allows</span> parties to agree to use negotiated grievance procedures and grievance arbitration to resolve their contractual disputes (including arbitrability questions), the Statute effectively <span class="Italic">requires</span> them to do so. Congress' determination that grievance arbitration must be part of federal-sector collective-bargaining agreements reflects its determination that such arbitration is "central[ ]" to the Statute.[46] In our view, this provides additional support for adhering to private-sector principles governing interlocutory review.[47]</p>

<p class="noindent-3">[T]o the extent that arbitration deserves deference because of its role as part of a system of industrial self-government, closer scrutiny might be justified in the federal sector because grievance procedures are statutorily mandated, whereas in the private sector grievance procedures are strictly the product of the parties' negotiations. But this difference seems inconsequential, for both the precise nature of grievance procedures and the matters to which they apply are generally left to the parties' discretion in the federal sector. Furthermore, the parties to the collective[-]bargaining agreement control the selection of the arbitrator who will resolve their particular dispute. As in the private sector, therefore, "[c]ourts should be most reluctant to override the earlier commitment of both parties to select [a] particular arbitrator as the articulator of their contractual obligations in order to...relieve one party from the unwelcome result of that purposeful choice." And, like their private[ ]sector counterparts, federal agency employers and employees can return "an occasional aberrant arbitral decision...to the same process of negotiation by which the parties created the arbitrator's authority in the first place." In these important senses, arbitration is as much a part of the system of self-government in the federal service as in the private sector.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Devine</span>, 697 F.2d at 437-38 (footnotes omitted).
Further, we believe that <span class="Italic">IRS II's</span> finding that expanding interlocutory review would promote effective and efficient government was misplaced. One of the primary goals of arbitration is "settling disputes efficiently."[48] If the parties pause the process while the Authority considers interlocutory exceptions--which can take time, particularly in complex cases--the interlocutory appeal disrupts the arbitration process.[49] Relatedly, if the parties continue with the arbitration proceedings while the exceptions are pending, which they often do,[50] encouraging them to file interlocutory exceptions likely saves them little in terms of the time and expense of continued arbitration proceedings. This is not a hypothetical concern. In the years following <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, the number of decisions that the Authority issued in cases involving interlocutory exceptions nearly <span class="Italic">tripled</span>.[51] Simply put, shifting litigation from arbitration to the Authority does not promote effective and efficient government.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In fashioning this standard, we note that, in reviewing arbitration awards, the Authority generally stands in the shoes of a federal district court in the private sector.[52] Therefore, to the extent that the Authority's pre-<span class="Italic">IRS II</span> precedent was rooted in private-sector precedent involving interlocutory appeals from district courts to courts of appeals, rather than appeals from arbitrators to district courts,[53] that focus was somewhat misplaced.[54]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Verizon Pa. LLC</span>, 216 F. Supp.3d at 535. We note that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that there could be an exception to the complete-arbitration rule in very limited cases, due to "the remote possibility of an extreme case that could cause 'severe irreparable injury' from an error that 'cannot effectively be remedied on appeal from the final judgment' and that would result in 'manifest injustice'" <span class="Italic">In re Sussex</span>, 781 F.3d at 1073 (quoting <span class="Italic">Aerojet-Gen. Corp</span>., 478 F.2 at 251). "Nevertheless, no intervention of an ongoing arbitration has ever been approved" in that circuit. <span class="Italic">Willick v. Napoli Bern Ripka &#x0026; Assocs</span>., 2019 WL 4580939, at *2 (C.D. Cal. May 9, 2019).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, the Statute gives no indication that the Authority should depart from these well-established private-sector principles. We recognize, however, that in the federal sector--unlike in the private sector--certain matters are excluded, as a matter of law, from negotiated grievance procedures and grievance arbitration.[59] In other contexts, the Authority has relied on these exclusions to carve out narrow exceptions to other Authority doctrines, such as the general rule that parties generally cannot make arguments to the Authority that they failed to raise at arbitration.[60]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. DOD, Def. Commissary Agency</span>, 69 FLRA 379, 380 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting on other grounds) ("[T]he Authority has declined to apply &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 [of the Authority's Regulations] to bar exceptions regarding arbitrators' statutory jurisdiction, regardless of whether the exception was raised during the arbitration.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe it is appropriate to carve out a similar exception in the context of interlocutory appeals and continue to allow interlocutory appeals that demonstrate legal bars to an arbitrator's jurisdiction. If a dispute arises whether an arbitrator is legally barred from hearing a grievance in the first place--an issue that the Authority reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, without deference to the arbitrator's legal interpretation[61]--it is appropriate for the Authority to intervene, when asked, on an interlocutory basis to resolve that dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[61]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Loc. 0922</span>, 70 FLRA 34, 36 (2016) ("In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law[.]"). By contrast, when an arbitrator bases an arbitrability determination on a collective-bargaining agreement, the Authority applies the deferential "essence" standard on review. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Overseas Priv. Inv. Corp</span>., 68 FLRA 982, 985 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting) ("When an arbitrator's substantive-arbitrability determination is based on an interpretation of the parties' agreement, the Authority reviews that determination <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, in order to hew as closely as possible to the private-sector principles discussed above, we also believe that this exception should be narrowly applied, in accordance with the following principles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we emphasize that this exception involves only bars to the arbitrator's authority to <span class="Italic">exercise jurisdiction over a grievance in the first place</span>--not situations where, for example, an arbitrator is asked to find a violation, or to grant a remedy, that would conflict with governing law.[62] The latter situations will not warrant interlocutory review.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[62]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of HUD</span>, 62 FLRA 52, 53 (2007) (finding that &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute does not provide a basis for finding a grievance inarbitrable and does not raise a plausible jurisdictional defect).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we will apply this exception only where an excepting party has <span class="Italic">demonstrated</span> that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law. It will not be sufficient to merely allege, or even present a "plausible" claim, regarding legal bars to jurisdiction. We acknowledge that, in some previous decisions, the Authority has remanded to the arbitrator for further findings when the record was ambiguous as to whether the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction.[63] On further reexamination, we believe that if the record is ambiguous--requiring further findings by the arbitrator--then it is more appropriate to deny interlocutory review and let the arbitration proceed. In our view, this approach will discourage disruptions to the arbitration process, while also signaling to arbitrators and parties that they should further develop a record that will enable the Authority to resolve any law-based jurisdictional challenges at a later stage.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[63]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 61 FLRA 634, 636 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third--consistent with both the Authority's extant precedent and the private-sector principles above--we will continue to grant interlocutory review only if doing so would bring an end to the entire dispute that the parties submitted to arbitration.[64]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[64]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA at 699; <span class="Italic">Reclamation</span>, 59 FLRA at 687.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Authority will now consider interlocutory exceptions only when the excepting party demonstrates <span class="Italic">both</span> that the arbitrator lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law and that resolving the exceptions would bring an end to the entire dispute that the parties submitted to arbitration. Accordingly, we hereby reverse <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> and any other Authority decisions to the extent that they conflict with this standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1790"></span>Applying this standard here, as stated above, the Agency argues that interlocutory review is warranted because the interim award fails to draw its <span class="Italic">essence</span> from the parties' agreement. In other words, the Agency is arguing that the grievance is inarbitrable under the terms of the parties' <span class="Italic">agreement</span>--not that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction as a matter of <span class="Italic">law</span>. Thus, the Agency fails to meet the first part of the above standard, and interlocutory review is not warranted. Accordingly, we dismiss the exceptions without prejudice to the Agency's ability to refile them when the Arbitrator issues a final award.</p>
