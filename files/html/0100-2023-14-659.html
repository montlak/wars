<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-660"><span class="space">G.</span> EVIDENCE OF PERFORMANCE</h3>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal required that evaluative conclusions based on the observation of any employee be supported and accompanied by evidence gathered by valid, objective, commonly accepted and understood techniques. The proposal did not interfere with the agency's selection of evaluation methods and it did not preclude personnel action based on those methods. The requirement of assurance of validity and objectivity of management's selected measurement techniques was an appropriate arrangement, similar to proposals requiring management to apply performance standards in a fair and equitable manner. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Gen. Comm. of AFGE for SSA Locals and SSA</span>, 23 FLRA 329, 336-37 (1986) (Proposal 6); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 66 (1993) (approving as negotiable Provision 30: "The rating official will determine what information he considers to be correct and will see that the record reflects the information that he considers to be correct."); <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO</span>, 25 FLRA 384 (1987); [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-655.html#sec6-656">Performance Measurement; Statistical Applications; Forced Distributions</a>," concerning proposals involving work measurement techniques.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable as a procedure, but not evaluated as an arrangement, was Proposal 5 in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1974 and VA Reg'l Office, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA 1170, 1179-80 (1993), that "[o]nly records which can be verified as accurate shall be used to evaluate performance":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute encompass the right to evaluate employee performance. Proposals preventing management from using particular data or information in evaluating employee performance directly interfere with that right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 5 prohibits management from using records that cannot be "verified as accurate" to evaluate employees' performance. Because the proposal precludes the Agency from using certain information in evaluating employee performance, it directly interferes with the Agency's right to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 39 FLRA at 799. As the Union has not claimed that the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we find that Proposal 5 is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable as both a procedure and an arrangement was Provision 27 in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 63 (1993), that "[c]omplaints against any bargaining unit member cannot be judged to be valid unless...reduced to writing and the complainant is identified." [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-180.html#sec6-181">Form and Notice of Complaints, Investigation</a>," discussing comparable negotiable protections for employees accused of or suspected of misconduct.]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declared nonnegotiable Proposal 12 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3509 and DHHS, SSA, Greenwood</span>, 46 FLRA 1590, 1607, 1608-12 (1993), that "[i]f documentation is collected for performance purposes, it will be related to the applicable GJT (Generic Job Task) in the employee's performance plan and will adhere to the Atlanta Regional Employee Assessment MOU [a collective bargaining agreement]":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that limit the data that agencies can use in performance appraisals directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association, Inc. v. FLRA</span>, 872 F.2d 1032, 1034-35 (D.C. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3272 and Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Chicago Regional Office</span>, 34 FLRA 675, 679 (1990). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 798-800 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>) (proposals that limit management's ability to gather information necessary to make determinations reserved to it interfere with the right to make those determinations). Additionally, a proposal that directly interferes with management's determinations on how it samples the performance of its employees in preparing performance appraisals directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 39 FLRA at 817-18; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2879 and Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Chula Vista District, San Diego, California</span>, 38 FLRA 244, 247-48 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This proposal places substantive limitations on the documentation that the Agency may collect for performance purposes in that the documentation must be related to the applicable GJTs in the employee's performance plan. Thus, the proposal directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that this limitation reflects limitations that already exist in Government-wide regulations, specifically, 5 C.F.R. Part 430. We find nothing in this particular regulation that addresses the documentation that an agency can collect for performance appraisal and rating purposes. Therefore, we reject the Union's claim that this proposal simply restates an "extrinsic requirement which is imposed <span id="page_1105"></span>on the employer." However, even assuming that the proposal merely paraphrases a Government-wide regulation, it would not necessarily be negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that paraphrase or set forth the terms of a Government-wide regulation are distinguishable from proposals that merely require an agency to comply with existing Government-wide regulations. The former impose an independent, contractual requirement on the agency while the latter do not. Under the former type of proposal, an agency would be required to honor the terms of the agreement for the life of the agreement regardless of any change in the Government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) (generally, an agency may not enforce rules or regulations that are in conflict with any applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed). The latter type of proposal merely requires compliance with existing Government-wide regulations and does not prevent the agency from enforcing any changes that occur in a regulation during the life of the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as these two types of proposals address the exercise of management's rights, the latter type of proposal, which merely requires an agency to comply with Government-wide regulations in exercising its management rights, does not directly interfere with those rights in circumstances where the particular regulation has the force and effect of law....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By requiring that documentation be related to the GJTs in an employee's performance plan, Proposal 12 imposes restrictions on the documentation that may be collected for performance purposes and, consequently, directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. The Union's claim that this proposal merely paraphrases requirements imposed by 5 C.F.R. Part 430 does not negate the fact that, by specifying those requirements in the contract, the proposal establishes an independent, contractual limitation on the Agency's discretion to exercise its management rights. The circumstances here are distinguishable from those involved in <span class="Italic">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, on which the Union relies. In that case, Proposal 38.4, which paraphrased a Government-wide regulation, did not specify requirements that directly interfered with the agency's management rights under the Statute; it merely specified a procedure within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute and was, therefore, negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has claimed generally that all of the proposals in this appeal constitute appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Consequently, we now address whether the portion of Proposal 12 requiring that documentation collected for performance purposes be related to an applicable GJT is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement notwithstanding the fact that it directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we discussed earlier, the analytical framework that we apply in determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute is that which is set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This proposal would limit the documentation that can be collected for performance appraisal and rating purposes to that which is related to the applicable GJT in the employee's performance plan. Even if we assume for purposes of this decision that this proposal constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3), we find that the record is not adequate to allow us to weigh the benefits and burdens that would flow from the proposal. The proposal places an absolute prohibition on collecting documentation for performance appraisal and rating purposes that does not relate to an applicable GJT in an employee's performance plan. The proposal does not, for example, condition collection, or subsequent use, on disclosure to the affected employee. Moreover, the prohibition allows for no exceptions based on any legitimate interests the Agency may have in collecting documentation that does not relate to an applicable GJT. However, although it is clear that the proposal would impose a burden on the Agency by restricting its ability to collect documentation for performance appraisal and rating purposes, the extent of that burden is unclear. That is, the Agency does not provide any explanation concerning the practical effect of the restriction on its ability to appraise employee performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also offers no explanation as to the nature and extent of the benefits that this proposal would afford employees, and the nature and extent of those benefits is not otherwise apparent to us. For example, it is unclear how establishing a general prohibition on the collection of any documentation that is unrelated to employees' performance elements would necessarily benefit those employees. While it is a reasonable assumption that such documentation may in some circumstances be detrimental in nature, the proposed prohibition is general and makes no distinction between documentation that has the potential to benefit employees and that which could work to their detriment. With regard to the former, the Union does not explain how precluding the collection of documentation that is not detrimental in nature would otherwise benefit employees. With regard to the latter, the Union has provided us with no explanation of the extent to which employees are, or reasonably expect to be, harmed by the collection of such data, or the concomitant benefits that would flow from its exclusion from the performance evaluation process. Because we are unable to determine the nature and extent of the benefits and burdens resulting from this proposal, we are unable to weigh the competing practical needs of employees and the Agency. Therefore, we cannot determine whether, even assuming that this proposal constitutes an arrangement, it would be an appropriate one....</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposal 15 was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 34 FLRA 1022, 1028, 1030 (1990), that as to employees who draft decisions for agency ALJs, with stated exceptions, the "signing of a decision draft by an Administrative Law Judge shall be <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that the decision draft was of acceptable quality....":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[P]roposal 15 establishes when an employee's work is of acceptable quality and requires that a managerial official use certain documents when evaluating an employee.... [I]t directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA resolved Provision 3 as negotiable in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 954, 959-61 (1993): "[t]he failure of all reviewers to agree that a particular matter is an error shall be considered as evidence that the matter is not an error [but] a difference in professional judgment." According to the union's position statement, the failure to agree was to be treated as evidence and not as conclusive. The union also explained that a mistake by a reviewer could be overcome by evidence that the employee's action was improper. The proposal did no more than call on management to consider the evidence; the proposal did not direct a particular result.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 54 (1991) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>), brought us Provision 12:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An evaluative recordation will be furnished to an employee within forty-five (45) days of its development or receipt by a supervisor. If not furnished to the employee within forty-five (45) days, it may not be used by the supervisor or by a ranking panel or official....</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal was negotiable, 39 FLRA at 58-59:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We agree with the Union that the provision provides employees with the opportunity to review and respond to documents affecting their performance ratings. In some circumstances, employee responses may, through clarification or explanation, change the weight assigned to documents critical of their level of performance, thereby avoiding subsequent adverse effects resulting from the use of those documents in rating performance. At a minimum, the provision makes employees aware of documents critical of their work so that they have the opportunity to improve their performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next we must examine whether the negative impact on management's rights to direct employees and to assign work is disproportionate to the provision's benefits in order to decide whether the proposed arrangement is "appropriate."... In other words, we must determine whether Provision 12 excessively interferes with management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the benefit afforded to employees by Provision 12 outweighs the limitations imposed on the Agency's exercise of its rights to direct employees and to assign work. It is clear that the disclosure to employees of adverse evaluation documents confers a benefit. Prohibiting the use of such documents in evaluations unless they are disclosed to the employee within 45 days ensures that the employees will be afforded the opportunity to see and comment on, if they so elect, any document to be used in their performance evaluations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, it is clear also that the provision has a negative impact on the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work. The provision would, in this regard, restrict the Agency's ability to appraise, or support appraisals of, employees.... Where the Agency failed to show a document to the concerned employee within the provision's time limit, the provision would preclude the use of that document "by the supervisor or by a ranking panel or official."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we note particularly that the proposed time limit begins to run only after the evaluation documents have been created or come into the hands of "a supervisor." Thus, the provision requires only that employees be provided with documents that management has already decided will be considered in assessing the employees' performance. In our view, the requirement that such existing documents be furnished to employees within a 45-day time frame, if the documents are to be used at all in evaluating employee performance, does not excessively interfere with the Agency's rights to direct employees and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) and to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C). That is, although management's failure to comply with the provision would bar subsequent use of a document, that limitation on management's rights does not outweigh the benefit to the affected employee in having the <span id="page_1106"></span>opportunity to respond to the evaluation. Moreover, timely disclosure of documents to employees affords benefits to management, in our view, by facilitating employee responses to such documents and, in some circumstances, by encouraging employees to alter their performance or behavior before more serious problems arise. In reaching this conclusion, we note particularly that applicable regulations state:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...communication and counseling during the work planning and the appraisal period will help ensure that work activity will be consistent with organizational goals. Such communication together with written standards may also reduce the likelihood of disagreements when the appraisal is made at the end of the period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal Personnel Manual Chapter 430, subchapter 2-3f.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Proposal 12 is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent">The negotiability of Proposal 12 was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1070-73 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first of the proposals at issue requires that personnel evaluations be provided to employees within 45 days of their development or receipt by a supervisor.&#x2003;Otherwise, the evaluations may not be used by the agency, and material that may adversely affect an employee's appraisal or rating must be destroyed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treasury takes the position that this proposal interferes with management's rights under subsection 7106(a) to "direct" employees and to "assign work," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), (B), because those rights necessarily include the ability to evaluate employee performance, and the proposal prohibits management from using evaluative information that is not shared with employees within the stipulated time frame. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 55 (1991) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>). In other words, it is not the requirement that the agency turn over to an employee his or her evaluation that putatively interferes with management's rights; it is rather the prohibition on the use of evaluative material not timely disclosed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA...accepted the union's...argument that the clause constitutes an "appropriate arrangement[ ] for employees adversely affected by the exercise of [management rights]" under paragraph (b)(3). It reasoned that employee evaluations are used to make personnel decisions and thus, if negative, will have adverse consequences. The proposal mitigates those consequences by enabling employees contemporaneously to explain or clarify unfavorable information.... The Authority, using its balancing test,...said that the proposal is appropriate because it does not "excessively interfere[ ]" with management rights. The benefit employees receive from the opportunity to respond to evaluations (which management is in no way constrained from instituting), it is said, outweighs any inconvenience management suffers from being required to disclose them, and the agency as a whole benefits from personnel decisions based on accurate information....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treasury argues that the FLRA is misusing paragraph (b)(3) to permit the union to bargain over the exercise of management rights, the effects of which are not yet known. It points out that any given evaluation may be positive, not negative, in which case it can hardly have an adverse effect. To be sure, an adverse effect cannot be merely speculative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1485, 1492 (D.C. Cir. 1989).... But we see nothing in the language of paragraph (b)(3) that requires union proposals to target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected. We think it sufficient that the Authority reasonably concluded that evaluations will surely have adverse effects on some employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treasury also makes the related argument that the FLRA's application of paragraph (b)(3) runs into a temporal analytical difficulty. Paragraph (b)(3), Treasury maintains, assumes that the adverse effect of the management right being exercised will occur <span class="Italic">before</span> a negotiated "arrangement" designed to ameliorate the impact of management's actions can come into play. That is, a union proposal is an "arrangement[ ] for employees adversely affected" only if it is intended to mitigate or minimize the adverse effects of a management right <span class="Italic">after</span> that right has been freely exercised. Since the adverse effects of the evaluations would not normally be felt until some subsequent personnel decisions were made based on the evaluations, the "arrangement" sought in this case would actually precede the adverse effect....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treasury's argument assumes the relevant management right is a personnel decision to be made some day based on the evaluation rather than the creation of the evaluation itself. All parties agree that the proposal places no burden on the employer's ability to make evaluations of employees (as might be so if the union sought to negotiate criteria to be used in the evaluation process). And the subsequent hypothetical personnel decision is interfered with because the agency cannot use an evaluation if the agency violates the admittedly negotiable requirement timely to provide an employee with his or her evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We rather doubt that, in these circumstances, the relevant management right should be thought to be the hypothetical future personnel decision rather than the evaluation. If it were the evaluation, the so-called temporal problem would disappear. But the FLRA, although fudging the issue, seems to accept Treasury's position that it is appropriate to measure the burden on the future hypothetical personnel decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As it is used in paragraph (b)(3), "adversely affected" is simply an adjectival phrase, not a verbal phrase indicating the past tense, and hence allows alternative temporal readings. The language, in short, is ambiguous, and, as we have so often noted, we must therefore defer to the FLRA's interpretation of its own authorizing statute so long as the interpretation is reasonable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government's underlying notion seems to be that paragraph (b)(3), like (b)(2), does not encompass union proposals that impinge in any way on reserved management rights, and, unless the arrangement applies only after the full exercise of the right, some interference with the right is unavoidable. But we have already held that (b)(3) impinges on the exercise of management rights. In <span class="Italic">Local 2782</span>, we distinguished (b)(2) from (b)(3), pointing out that (b)(3) contemplates some constraints on the exercise of management prerogatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2782</span>, 702 F.2d at 1186-88; <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Local 32, American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA</span>, 728 F.2d 1526, 1528 (D.C. Cir. 1984). While a direct interference test is appropriate to distinguish procedural from substantive proposals under paragraph (b)(2), which marks out the boundaries of protected management rights, we said that the same test would drain paragraph (b)(3), which can only be read as an <span class="Italic">exception</span> to management prerogatives, of all meaning. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2782</span>, 702 F.2d at 1186-87. Arrangements for adversely affected employees will inevitably come at some cost to the exercise of management prerogatives. The <span class="Italic">Local 2782</span> proposal, for example, may have left the right to demote employees unimpaired, but the "mitigating" promotion preferences themselves prospectively infringed a different management right--the right to fill positions from "among properly ranked and certified candidates" or "any other appropriate source." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2782</span>, 702 F.2d at 1185.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, here, the union's proposal leaves unaffected the right of the employer to evaluate employees, and, even assuming the contractual sanction for refusing to share the evaluation in a timely fashion can be thought an interference with management's right to make a personnel decision, it is a burden the agency easily avoids--by simply complying with the concededly negotiable disclosure requirement. We therefore do not take seriously Treasury's alternative argument that the first proposal is "inappropriate" because it permits management to evaluate some employees based on complete information and others on incomplete information, thereby distorting the appraisal process. That again assumes that the 45-day requirement will be violated, and we see no reason why it would be. We therefore affirm the Authority's determination that the first proposal is a negotiable appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3295 and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision</span>, 44 FLRA 63, 64
(1992), required bargaining over a proposal limiting the information that management may rely on in a performance-based action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Information that is available to the Office...at the time of a progress review meeting, and which is not provided to the employee at that meeting, will not be used to adversely affect a performance rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained, 44 FLRA at 66-72:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal refers to "information" which is available to the Agency. Although that term is not defined in the proposal, the Union describes information as "evidence about an employee's performance" and notes that the proposal allows employees to discuss "supervisory perceptions." Consistent with the Union's statements, and in the absence of a contrary definition in the record, we find that "information" encompasses supervisory judgments concerning performance, whether or not those judgments are in writing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4303(c)(2)(A) establishes a time limit for the use of "instances of unacceptable performance" in imposing performance-based discipline. The proposal, however, does not concern "instances of unacceptable performance." Rather, the proposal concerns providing employees, during the performance appraisal cycle, with information which subsequently may adversely affect performance ratings. Therefore, nothing in the proposal alters the statutory time limit on the use of instances of unacceptable performance as grounds for performance-based adverse actions. Indeed, the proposal does not address in any way the "age" of such performance. Instead, the proposal addresses only the consequences of the Agency's failure to provide affected employees with certain information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Put simply, the proposal and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(c)(2)(A) address different matters. The proposal encourages the Agency to provide employees with certain performance information by prohibiting the Agency from using <span id="page_1107"></span>that information in a particular manner if it fails to do so. The statutory provision, on the other hand, addresses only the "age" of instances of unacceptable performance which may be used when management decides to impose a performance-based action. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's argument that the proposal conflicts with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(c)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, management's rights to direct employees and assign work include the right to determine the quantity, quality, and timeliness of employees' work. These rights also encompass management's right to determine the aspects of employees' work that it will evaluate in preparing employee performance appraisals.... Proposals preventing management from using particular information in evaluating employee performance directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal prohibits the Agency from using information to adversely affect a performance rating if the information was not furnished to the affected employee at the first progress review meeting after it became available.&#x2003;As such, the proposal prevents the Agency from using certain information to evaluate employee performance. Consequently, the proposal directly interferes with the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the proposal would preclude the Agency from using certain information to affect performance ratings adversely, the proposal also would preclude the Agency from using that information to support performance-based actions based on those ratings.... Therefore, we conclude that the proposal directly interferes with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees, assign work, and discipline. Accordingly, it is not a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that, if the Authority finds that the proposal interferes with management's rights, the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of the rights. In response, the Agency requests that the excessive interference test adopted in <span class="Italic">KANG</span> "be abandoned."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e decline the Agency's request that we abandon the test, adopted in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, for determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement. Consistent with <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, we will determine whether the disputed proposal is intended as an arrangement and, if so, whether it excessively interferes with the exercise of management's rights under the Statute. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposal affords employees a timely opportunity to review and respond to information which, in management's view, adversely affects performance ratings or supports performance-based disciplinary actions. This opportunity, the Union maintains, enables employees "to correct a supervisor's misperceptions" and avoid poor performance ratings. We conclude, based on the Union's assertions, that the proposal is intended as an arrangement to mitigate the adverse effects of the exercise of management's rights to direct employees, assign work, and discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we reject as meritless the Agency's argument that the proposal cannot constitute an appropriate arrangement because it is "intended...to enforce procedural rights previously agreed upon[.]"... The Agency cites no authority, and none is apparent to us, for the proposition that appropriate arrangements and provisions enforcing contractual rights are mutually exclusive. We also reject the Agency's argument that the adverse effect addressed by the proposal is "completely speculative."... Under the Agency's merit pay system, performance ratings are directly related to employees' eligibility for increased compensation. Moreover, as noted previously, ratings are directly related to performance-based disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next determine whether the benefits to employees flowing from the proposal outweigh the negative impact on management's rights to direct employees, assign work, and impose performance-based discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal offers significant benefits to employees.&#x2003;In particular, the proposal encourages the Agency promptly to bring to employees' attention information adversely affecting their performance. Employees' awareness of this information facilitates their ability both to correct inaccurate information and to improve performance before receiving final performance ratings. These benefits would flow also to the Agency by contributing to the accuracy and reliability of performance information and by encouraging performance improvement. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual Chapter 430, subchapter 2-3.f. ("communication and counseling during the work planning and the appraisal period will help ensure that work activity will be consistent with organizational goals. Such communication together with written standards may also reduce the likelihood of disagreements when the appraisal is made at the end of the period."). In addition, the proposal bars management from using information, not timely shared with employees, to adversely affect performance ratings. This is an obvious benefit to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the proposal has direct and obvious effects on the Agency also. In this regard, the proposal affects management's responsibilities to appraise employees and take actions based on those appraisals. Moreover, the proposal could operate in some circumstances to preclude the Agency from appraising an employee's performance as unacceptable and from supporting a performance-based disciplinary action based thereon. These are important management interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find significant, however, the fact that the Agency already has agreed to share the information addressed by the proposal. In particular, the Agency agreed "to exchange information concerning the performance of the employee as compared to the established performance plan since the time of the preceding review meeting." Indeed, this information exchange is the expressed purpose of the progress reviews. By meeting its agreed-upon obligation to share information adverse to employees' performance ratings, the Agency would avoid any burden on its rights to direct employees, assign work, and discipline. Moreover, the parties' agreement encompasses the exchange of information concerning performance "since the time of the preceding review meeting." As such, the time limits the Agency now finds unreasonable and objectionable are those to which it has already agreed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the proposal establishes a remedy for the Agency's failure to abide by its contractual commitment to share performance information with employees. We find it appropriate to consider the effects of the proposal on the Agency's rights in light of the Agency's agreement to assume the obligation underlying the proposal. Further, in view of the connection between the proposal and the Agency's previous agreement, we conclude that, in addition to offering benefits to unit employees in connection with performance ratings, the proposal would encourage adherence to contractual obligations and, thereby, enhance confidence in collective bargaining as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we conclude that although the effects of the proposal on management's rights may be significant, those effects are outweighed by the benefits conferred by the proposal on unit employees. Accordingly, we conclude that the proposal does not excessively interfere with the Agency's rights to direct employees, assign work, or impose discipline based on unsatisfactory performance under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) and constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 44, 48 (1993), approved as negotiable Provision 17, limiting management to applying timeliness standards to cases assigned to unit employees that appeared on docket reports issued by management. If an assignment was not on the report, an unlisted assignment could not be held against the employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Provision 17 would benefit certain employees, who have relied to their detriment on information contained in docket reports, by not subjecting them to poorer performance appraisals or performance-based actions for failure to work on, or timely complete, cases not listed on the docket report. In other words, this part would protect employees who otherwise would be adversely affected for relying on the information provided them by management. Accordingly, we find that this part offers a significant benefit to affected employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, this part restricts the Agency in evaluating certain employees' performance. Management would be unable to evaluate employees' timeliness on cases omitted from the docket report. However, the accuracy of its docket reports is within management's control, and management can amend docket reports to include previously omitted cases. Therefore, management has the ability to minimize or eliminate the burden on its rights to direct employees and assign work by assuring that the docket reports accurately reflect current assignments. Balancing the significant benefit to affected employees against the burden on the Agency's rights, we find that this disputed part of Provision 17 does not excessively interfere with management's right to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) and, therefore, constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 39 FLRA at 56-59 (proposal barring use of certain documents to adversely affect performance ratings held to be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement).</p>
