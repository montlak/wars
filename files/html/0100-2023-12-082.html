<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-82"><span class="space">b.</span> Undue Disruption Notice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">By Federal Register notice of May 24, 1999, 64 FR 27899, the Board amended its regulation 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(2) to delete a requirement that, as a condition to the Board's processing of an agency PFR or cross-PFR, the agency notify the AJ and the appellant of the undue disruption requirement. The current edition of 5 CFR 1201.116 (a) (2022) requires that the agency provide with its PFR or cross-PFR a certification that the agency has "complied with the interim relief order either by providing the required interim relief or by satisfying the requirements of 5 USC 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B)," governing undue disruption determinations. 5 CFR 1201.116(b) (2022) allows the appellant to challenge the agency's certification of compliance with the interim relief order. Under OPM interim relief regulations, 5 CFR 772.102 (2022), agency paperwork implementing interim relief need not show the appellant was restored to "career" status; it was sufficient if the agency restores the appellant by placing him on an interim appointment effective the date of the initial decision and pending the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Avant v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 467, 475 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 1999, Board regulations required agencies to notify the AJ of an undue disruption determination. Under the 1999 edition of 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(2), "if the initial decision provides interim relief which requires that the appellant be returned to his or her place of employment pending the outcome of any petition for review and the agency determines that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly disruptive to the work environment, the agency must notify both the appellant and the judge in writing." <span class="Italic">Burke v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 69 MSPR 407, 412-13 (1996), made clear that the undue disruption determination must be provided at least to the Board if not to the AJ. Under <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, it was insufficient to notify only the appellant's representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 334, 338 (1995) (undue disruption notice was sufficiently stated in the PFR). Although the agency was permitted latitude in how it phrased its undue disruption determination, the communication had to be made to the appellant by the deadline for the agency PFR. If the communication was first made in response to the appellant's motion to dismiss following the close of the record on the PFR, the notice of undue disruption was too late and the agency PFR would be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shay v. DOD</span>, 67 MSPR 366, 369 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That law that follows is, for the most part, the result of the more complex interim relief regulations on the books through 1999. The earlier regulations required evidence of interim relief rather than certification of interim relief. The cases that follow examine what the Board has determined to be sufficient (or insufficient) evidence of an undue disruption determination. These cases may still be useful when the appellant challenges the agency's interim relief certification and the agency then must supply evidence that interim relief has been provided to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are circumstances that would permit an agency to obtain the benefit of an "undue disruption" determination without using those exact words. The Board rejected an approach dependent upon the incantation of magic words, <span class="Italic">Storm v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 14, 25-27 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who prevails in a Board proceeding at the regional office level is entitled to "the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A). There are two exceptions to this rule. First, complete interim relief need not be provided where the administrative judge determines that it is not appropriate. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(i). As noted above, the administrative judge in this appeal ordered the provision of interim relief, so the first exception is not applicable. Second, where the administrative judge orders interim relief the agency need not provide complete relief if it "determines that the return or presence of such employee...is unduly disruptive to the work environment." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii). In such circumstances, the agency may "prevent[ ] the return or presence" of the employee, as long as it provides the employee with appropriate pay and benefits during the pendency of its petition for review. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). An agency that determines that returning an appellant to his former position would be unduly disruptive may detail that employee to another position. <span class="Italic">Shaishaa v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 60 MSPR 359, 362-63 (1994); <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 183, 185 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations require that a petition for review must be accompanied by evidence showing that the agency complied with the interim relief order by either: (1) Providing complete interim relief; or (2) making a determination that the appellant's return or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b). If the agency fails to submit evidence that it is providing the appellant with complete interim relief, or fails to submit evidence that it has made an undue disruption determination, its appeal will be dismissed. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(4); <span class="Italic">Shaishaa</span>, 60 MSPR at 362-63 (failure to submit evidence of an undue disruption determination); <span class="Italic">Steinhauer v. Dept. of the Army</span>, MSPB Docket No. SE0752930132-I-1, slip op. 3 (Nov. 4, 1993) (failure to submit evidence of compliance with the interim relief order); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 270, 272 (1991). In this appeal, the agency acknowledges that it has not provided the appellant with complete interim relief but has detailed him to another position. Thus, because the agency has not provided the appellant with complete interim relief, our analysis of the agency's compliance with the interim relief order must start with a finding of whether the agency determined that the appellant's return to his ATCS position would be an undue disruption. <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 185 (the only action not associated with a determination of undue disruption is returning the employee to his or her former duty station).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the letter to the appellant submitted with its petition for review, the agency states that, as interim relief, the appellant would be returned to the pay and position status of his GS-13 ATCS position. The agency further states in the letter, however, that "due to your loss of certification, you cannot be returned to Air Traffic Control Specialist duties or to any Testing Designated Position" and therefore the agency was detailing him to a "set of duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 3 F.3d 1522, 1525 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court held that the Board could not assume that the agency had determined that the appellant's return or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive. Nevertheless, neither the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Board's regulations, nor the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span> requires that an agency's undue disruption determination take a particular form. Because the agency informed the appellant that he could not be reinstated to his ATCS position because of his medical disqualification, we find that the agency effectively informed the appellant that his return to his prior position would be an undue disruption.[7] This appeal can be distinguished from the circumstances in <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span> because, in that appeal, the agency only stated that it was placing Mr. DeLaughter on administrative leave without any additional information, while here the agency stated the reason it was not returning the appellant to his former position<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span>, 3 F.3d at 1523; <span class="Italic">see also Shaishaa</span>, 60 MSPR 359. Thus, because the letter provided with the agency's petition for review is sufficient to show that an undue disruption determination was made, we need not consider the affidavits filed by the agency in response to the show cause order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The Board will not look behind an agency's determination that returning an appellant to his former position would constitute an undue disruption. <span class="Italic">Aliota v.</span> <span class="Italic">VA</span>, 60 MSPR 491, 494-95 (1994); <span class="Italic">Ginocchi</span>, 53 MSPR at 68.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 334, 337-38 (1995), confirmed that undue disruption determinations could be indirectly stated if the agency's intent is made sufficiently clear in a timely PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations require that a petition for review must be accompanied by evidence that the agency complied with the interim relief order by either providing complete interim relief or making a determination that the appellant's return to or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b). If an agency makes such an undue disruption determination, it must notify both the appellant and the administrative judge in writing and provide evidence <span id="Page_1671"></span>of such notification to the Board when it files a petition for review or cross petition for review. 59 Fed. Reg. 30,863 (1994) (to be codified at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)). If the agency fails to provide evidence that it made an undue disruption determination and communicated that determination to the appellant, its petition for review will be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 66 MSPR 287, 296 (1995); <span class="Italic">Storm</span>, 64 MSPR at 25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An undue disruption determination need not take any particular form, but the agency must at least inform the appellant that his return to or presence in the workplace would excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the <span id="Page_1672"></span>normal course of the agency's operation. <span class="Italic">See Wilson</span>, at 294; <span class="Italic">see also Storm</span>, 64 MSPR at 26. When an agency does not specifically state that the appellant's return or presence would be unduly disruptive, the explanation must be specific and detailed enough to permit the Board to reach the same conclusion directly. <span class="Italic">See Storm</span>, 64 MSPR at 25-26; <span class="Italic">Manning v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 62 MSPR 456, 459 (1994). While neither the SF-52 nor the December 2, 1994 letter from the agency informed the appellant that the agency had made a determination that his return to his original position would be unduly disruptive or afforded him any explanation for the reassignment, the petition for review contained an explanation that the appellant was reassigned "because of an altercation and threats of bodily harm made by the appellant against his supervisor." We find that this statement, which the agency communicated to the appellant by its timely petition for review, is sufficient to show that the agency made an undue disruption determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant denied threatening his supervisor, the scope of the Board's review of an undue disruption determination is limited to the issue of whether the agency actually made an undue disruption determination and whether the appellant received the appropriate pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">See King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency did not provide evidence that it informed the administrative judge of its undue disruption determination as required by the Board's regulations. 59 Fed. Reg. 30,863 (1994) (to be codified at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b)(2)). We find that this omission is not a sufficient basis for finding that the agency failed to comply with the interim relief order. <span class="Italic">See Pencook v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 409, 413-14 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency does not use the right verbiage, the Board may overlook a notice of undue disruption when the appellant is placed on interim relief and the circumstances are that the appellant could not have been placed back on the job, <span class="Italic">Maroney v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-15-0594-I-2 (NP 8/4/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's challenge to his placement on administrative leave, the September 19, 2016 memorandum the agency submitted with its petition for review explained that, in accordance with the administrative judge's interim relief order, the appellant was being placed on administrative leave, in pay status, effective the date of the initial decision. The agency's action placing the appellant on administrative leave does not, in and of itself, reflect a failure on its part to comply with interim relief. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 12. However, such placement, without an accompanying certification from the agency that the appellant's return to work would be "unduly disruptive to the work environment," would fail to evidence the agency's compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order. <span class="Italic">Aquino v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 35, &#x00B6; 7 (2014). The agency has not presented any evidence that it informed the appellant that his return to work would be unduly disruptive; rather, as noted, the agency's evidence only shows that it explained to the appellant the steps it had taken to place him on paid administrative leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency fails to establish its compliance with an interim relief order, the Board has the discretion to dismiss its petition for review, but it need not do so. <span class="Italic">Kolenc v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 11 (2013). Here, based on the evidence submitted by the agency, we find that it substantially complied with the administrative judge's interim relief order. It could not reasonably have returned the appellant to his Training Instructor (Pararescue) position because, as noted, he was found to be medically unable to perform those duties. <span class="Italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 12 n.2. Under the circumstances, therefore, we exercise our discretion not to dismiss the agency's petition for review as argued by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Omites v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 557, 561 (1998) (letter adequately communicated an undue disruption determination: "We have held that an undue disruption determination need not take any particular form but must at least inform the appellant that his return to the workplace would excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the normal course of the agency's operations."); <span class="Italic">Costin v.

<p class="Body-Text">Once the agency explicitly or implicitly made an undue disruption determination, the Board would not further review the rationale offered by the agency for not restoring the appellant to his original position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bernstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 375, 379 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) ("Since the Board's authority is restricted to deciding whether an undue disruption determination was made when required, and whether the appellant is receiving appropriate pay and benefits, we cannot review whether the agency's reasons for assigning the appellant to the Programs and Project Management Division were, as he claims, improper. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 557, 561, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 168 F.3d 1322, No. 98-3199 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 9, 1998) (Table)."); <span class="Italic">Hovanec v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 340, 345 (1995) ("The agency's determination that it could not return the appellant to his original position because of its reorganization is sufficient to meet the undue disruption determination.... Thus, the Board lacks authority to consider the appellant's challenges to the agency's stated reasons that support the undue disruption determination."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the Board lacks authority to determine whether an agency determination of undue disruption can be set aside because of agency bad faith).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The circumstances had to be clear from the agency's communications that restoration of the appellant would be unduly disruptive, <span class="Italic">Manning v. DOD</span>, 62 MSPR 456, 458-60 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n an unsworn statement regarding interim relief, the agency's representative asserts that the appellant will not be assigned his former duties as a cashier pending the Board's final decision but instead will be assigned "other GS-3 level duties which do not involve monetary responsibilities." He states that the agency's decision in this regard is based upon the administrative judge's finding that the appellant had accepted coupons used fraudulently by a co-worker and upon the resulting loss of trust by the appellant's supervisor in his honesty....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency files a petition for review of an initial decision providing interim relief to an appellant, it must present evidence that it has either provided complete interim relief or determined that his return or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive. Its failure to submit such evidence will result in the dismissal of its petition. The agency's statutory obligation to make a determination of undue disruption is not triggered only when it returns the appellant to his former position and duties at his former duty station. <span class="Italic">See Heath</span> <span class="Italic">v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 183, 185 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency asserts that the appellant has been assigned different duties than those he performed before his removal and it was therefore required to make a finding of undue disruption. <span class="Italic">See Heath</span>, 60 MSPR at 185. For the purposes of establishing compliance with an interim relief order, documentary evidence or an affidavit or declaration specifying the manner of compliance is required; an unsworn statement is not sufficient to show compliance. <span class="Italic">See May v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 422, 424 (1993). The unsworn statement by the agency's representative setting forth the reasons for the assignment of different duties to the appellant thus is insufficient to show compliance here. More fundamentally, however, as we discuss below, the content of that statement does not demonstrate that the agency has made a finding of undue disruption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statement makes clear that the agency has lost confidence in the appellant's honesty and that it therefore does not trust him to perform the duties of a cashier; it does not, however, contain an explicit finding of undue disruption. Recently, the Board has held that it is unnecessary for an agency's undue disruption determination to take a particular form; it concluded that such a determination requires only that the agency inform the appellant that his return or presence in the workplace would "excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the normal course of the agency's operation." <span class="Italic">See Storm v. Dept. of the Army</span>, MSPB Dkt. Nos. AT0752930265I1, AT0752930519I1, slip op. at 17 (Mar. 31, 1994)[64 MSPR 14]. The Board applied that holding to a situation in which the agency had informed the appellant in a letter (which it submitted with its petition for review) that it would return him to his Air Traffic Control Specialist position as interim relief but that, because of his loss of a medical certification, it would assign him other duties. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 5-6. The Board found that the agency's failure to make a specific finding of undue disruption was "not significant because the presence of an individual without certification as a[n] air traffic controller would excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the normal course of the agency's operation." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 18. It therefore concluded that the letter was sufficient to show that a finding of undue disruption had been made. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statement filed by the agency's representative does not meet this standard. As an initial matter, we note that the agency has submitted no evidence showing that an official in the appellant's line of authority told him that he was being assigned different duties and the reasons for this action. We thus have no basis for finding (as we did in <span class="Italic">Storm</span>) that the agency directly informed the appellant that a return to his former duties would be unduly disruptive. Moreover, the agency representative's bare assertion that the appellant's supervisor has lost trust in his honesty does not specifically clarify how his return to his former duties would excessively or in an unwarranted fashion cause disorder or turmoil to the normal course of the agency's operation. In <span class="Italic">Storm</span>, the appellant's lack of certification to perform the duties of his position provided obvious and ample support for the conclusion that the agency's functions would be unduly disrupted by his return to his former duties. Here, the unsupported claim by the agency representative that the appellant's supervisor cannot trust him does not furnish, without more, support for such a conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an agency does not fulfill its statutory obligations by specifically stating that an appellant's return or presence would be unduly disruptive, the explanation that it does provide must be specific and detailed enough to permit the Board to reach that same conclusion directly. The Board will not cure any deficiencies in such an explanation by supplying the agency with additional rationalizations or justifications for its failure to provide complete interim relief to the appellant. As discussed above, a bald statement that the appellant's supervisor has lost trust in him does not convince us that the normal course of the agency's operation would be thrown into disorder or turmoil in an excessive or unwarranted fashion by the appellant's return to his former duties. Because the agency thus has not provided evidence of a finding of undue disruption...we dismiss its petition for review.</p>
