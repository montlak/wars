<h3 class="h3" id="sec4-82"><span class="space">C.</span> PROPOSAL NO LONGER RELEVANT</h3>
<p class="noindent">A proposal may be moot if it concerns an event that occurred before FLRA rules on the negotiability dispute, <span class="Italic">NATCA Local ZHU and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 65 FLRA 738, 739 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a proposal addresses an event that has already occurred, the Authority will find that the proposal is moot and will dismiss the petition. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, Chapter 207,</span> 58 FLRA 409, 410 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>); <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 35,</span> 54 FLRA 1384, 1387-88 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1482,</span> 45 FLRA 52, 65-66 (1992). In this connection, where a proposal has become moot, issuance of a ruling on the merits of the proposal would constitute an advisory opinion, which is prohibited under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.10. <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Local 1418,</span> 53 FLRA 1191, 1195 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals 1 and 8 address the implementation of the Lufkin Sector that has already occurred.&#x2003;In particular, Proposals 1 and 8 expressly require the Agency to take certain actions prior to that implementation. Accordingly, Proposals 1 and 8 are moot. <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 58 FLRA at 410 (dismissing petition as moot where proposal referred to a specific event that had already occurred and required agency to take action by a date that had passed).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA implied, but did not directly hold, that a negotiability appeal is moot if the action sought to be negotiated is completed and not continuing when the negotiability appeal is presented to FLRA for decision. <span class="Italic">FUSE, NAGE and Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr.</span>, 3 FLRA 179, 180 (1980) (the union did not respond to the agency's suggestion of mootness); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 35 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 54 FLRA 1384, 1387-88 (1998) (proposal that involved planning process for location of various laundry and food service facilities was moot when construction was completed when FLRA reviewed negotiability appeal); <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 1418 and USIA</span>, 53 FLRA 1191, 1195 (1998) (when through arbitration dispute over back pay entitlement was resolved, negotiability appeal on proposal seeking to resolve back pay claim through different formulation was dismissed as moot). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 35 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 54 FLRA 1377, 1380 n.6 (1998) (proposal to locate restaurant in one location was not mooted when agency located it in another; agency could still build facility at location desired by union).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 207 and FDIC</span>, 58 FLRA 409, 410 (2003), summarized the law concerning mootness of proposals involving events that occurred by the time FLRA issues its negotiability decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a proposal addresses an event that has already occurred, the Authority will find that the proposal is moot and will dismiss the petition. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Int'l Fed'n of Prof'l &#x0026; Technical Eng'rs, Local 35,</span> 54 FLRA 1384, 1387-88 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting) (citations omitted) <span class="Italic">(IFPTE); NFFE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1482, </span>45 FLRA 52, 66 (1992); <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>35 FLRA 7, 11 (1990). In this connection, where a proposal has become moot, issuance of a ruling on the merits of the proposal would constitute an advisory opinion, which is prohibited under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.10.[3] <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of</span> <span class="Italic">State, County &#x0026; Mun. Employees, Local 1418, </span>53 FLRA 1191, 1195 (1998). Even where a union has argued that the issues raised by a proposal could be relevant in future situations, the Authority has dismissed the petition, noting that the concerns could be adequately addressed in a "reformulated" proposal. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">12, </span>39 FLRA 1496, 1499 (1991). Similarly, the Authority has found a proposal moot even where the union is challenging, in a pending proceeding, the legality of the action that rendered the negotiability petition moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">IFPTE, </span>54 FLRA at 1385.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.10 provides: "The Authority and the General Counsel will not issue advisory opinions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_462"></span>The instant proposals address a particular RIF that has already occurred.&#x2003;In particular, the first proposal would require that the first group of employees be RIF'd in May 2002--a date that has passed. Although the second proposal does not contain any dates that have passed, it would have no effect without the first proposal. Thus, if the first proposal is found to be moot, then it would be meaningless for the Authority to separately address the negotiability of the second proposal<span class="Italic">. Cf. Int'l Fed'n of Prof'l &#x0026; Technical Eng'rs, Local 49</span> 52 FLRA 813, 821 (1996) (Authority dismissed petition with regard to proposals that were "inextricably intertwined" with proposal found nonnegotiable); <span class="Italic">Int'l Org.</span> <span class="Italic">of Masters Mates &#x0026; Pilots, Marine Div., Pan.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposals are not moot because the arbitration case could result in reinstatement of the RIF'd employees, at which time the proposals could be implemented. However, the Union does not explain how, <span class="Italic">as worded, </span>the proposals can be implemented at a future date. In this regard, the proposals expressly require the Agency to take action on specific dates that have passed. As such, even if the RIF'd employees were reinstated and the Agency were ordered to bargain over the proposals, the Agency could not implement the proposals [4]. Accordingly, the Union's assertion does not support a conclusion that the proposals are not moot.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;If bargaining results and the Agency alleges that a subsequent Union proposal is nonnegotiable, then the Union may file a negotiability appeal regarding that proposal. <span class="Italic">See AFGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 12, </span>39 FLRA at 1499 (Authority dismissed petition but noted union's concerns could be "adequately addressed in a proposal reformulated" to exclude specific dates."). As such, and consistent with <span class="Italic">IFPTE, </span>54 FLRA at 1388 n.4, the dismissal of the petition here is without prejudice to the Union's right to file a petition regarding a new proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">The appeal is moot if the proposal requires some action on a date that has passed and there is no explanation in the record as to how the proposal could be implemented. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 38 FLRA 263, 264 (1990) (issue raised on agency's motion to dismiss); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1278-79 (1997) (provision allowing official time for union representatives to attend committee meetings was mooted when the committee was abolished: "The Authority will dismiss a proposal as moot where, for example, a dispute has been rendered moot by the passage of time and a bargaining order would serve no purpose."); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Louisville</span>, 45 FLRA 52, 65 (1992) (as to Proposal 3: "The Authority will dismiss a proposal as moot where: (1) the proposal prescribes that an action should take place by a certain date; (2) the date has passed; and (3) the parties have not addressed, and it is not otherwise apparent, how compliance with the date set forth in the proposal could be effected.").

<p class="noindent">The parties may avoid a finding that proposals are mooted by events following the filing of the petition. Under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 39 FLRA 1496, 1498-99 (1991), dismissing a petition involving a proposal concerned with a furlough:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 35 FLRA 7 (1990) (IRS), the Authority addressed the use of specific dates in bargaining proposals or provisions. The provision...provided that specific actions were to be taken by specific dates, all of which had passed by the time that the union had filed its response to the agency's statement of position. The Authority discussed what action it would take in future negotiability appeals relating to proposals or provisions that contain specific dates. The Authority stated that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]n future cases...where proposals or provisions contain specific dates that may pass before final Authority action, the parties should address how compliance with the proposal or provisions could be effected. If specific dates have passed and the parties have not addressed this matter (and it is not otherwise apparent how compliance could be effected), the proposals or provisions will be found moot and petitions for review will be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...As an alternative to incorporating specific dates in proposals or provisions, the parties are encouraged to consider using specific time frames or periods when fashioning proposals. In doing so, the parties could avoid a finding by the Authority that the matter proposed to be bargained has become moot by the passage of time....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the petition for review must be dismissed as moot. Because the date in the proposal has passed, and the parties have not addressed, nor is it otherwise apparent, how compliance with the date set forth in the proposal could be effected, the proposal is moot. With respect to the Union's concerns as to why the Authority should rule on the negotiability of the proposal despite the fact that the timeframe referenced in the proposal has passed, those concerns can be adequately addressed in a proposal reformulated in accordance with the Authority's suggestion in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Decisions concerning mootness of proposals should be read conservatively. Management is not to determine unilaterally what is and what is not relevant or necessary. An agency defense to a negotiability appeal that the union proposals involve temporary programs with no more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact will be rejected if the union prevailed in a prior ULP complaint charging a failure to bargain and FLRA there determined the impact of the changes to be more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 26 and IRS, Atlanta Dist.</span>, 22 FLRA 314, 315 (1986). In <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 32</span>, 27 FLRA 664, 668-69 (1987), the union proposed both that employees not be required to adhere to a dress code while on detail and that mileage be paid "consistent with the regulations." The agency countered by calling the proposals nonnegotiable for the reasons that it had no intention of imposing a dress code and that it had already agreed verbally to the mileage request. The proposal was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's assertion that the proposal was "meaningless" does not provide a basis for finding the proposal nonnegotiable. In view of the relationship of the proposal to the details and in the absence of any claim or showing that this proposal conflicts with law, Government-wide regulation or any agency regulation for which a compelling need exists, we conclude that the proposal is negotiable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's assertion that this [mileage] proposal was "unnecessary" does not present a basis for finding the proposal nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region VII, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 14 FLRA 258 (1984), in which the Authority found that an agency was not relieved of the obligation to enter into a written agreement by virtue of the fact that it had apparently abided by commitments made verbally.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal may not be moot if the situation it addresses seems capable of repetition. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 738 and Dept. of Army, Combined Arms Ctr.</span>, 39 FLRA 872, 875 (1991), the union made some proposals regarding promotion procedures concerning two positions involved in a reorganization. The proposal was worded sufficiently broadly in that it was not limited to the circumstances presented by the reorganization that spawned the proposal. The positions were filled, but that did not moot the controversy: the "[u]nion is entitled to a determination as to the negotiability of the proposal in dispute insofar as it could apply to a future reorganization."</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a proposal may have been triggered by a specific personnel situation resolved by the time FLRA addresses the negotiability of the proposal, the proceeding is not moot if the proposal could benefit employees in the future, as in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VA Connecticut Healthcare Sys.,</span> 64 FLRA 132, 133 (2009) (Member Beck dissenting on a different issue), involving a proposal providing for bargaining on accommodative measures for employees the agency determined were physically or psychologically unable to qualify to use a firearm:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal is moot and that the Union's filing of the negotiability appeal constitutes an abuse of the Authority's process. Specifically, as discussed above, the Agency contends that the Policy was implemented a long time ago, that bargaining has occurred, and that the Union "has grieved, filed a ULP, and pursued an EEO complaint over the adverse impact of [the Policy] on the one unit officer who failed to qualify[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.10 of the Authority's Regulations states, in pertinent part, that "[t]he Authority...will<span class="Italic"> </span>not<span class="Italic"> </span>issue<span class="Italic"> </span>advisory<span class="Italic"> </span>opinions."<span class="Italic"> </span>Consistent<span class="Italic"> </span>with<span class="Italic"> </span>this<span class="Italic"> </span>regulation<span class="Italic">,</span> the Authority will not resolve the negotiability of proposals that are moot. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, Chapter 207,</span> 58 FLRA 409. 410 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). The Authority has held that a dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 57 FLRA 264, 268 (2001) (citation omitted) (Member Wasserman dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that no employee had been adversely affected by the Policy, the proposal could nonetheless benefit employees who, in the future, fail to either qualify or re-qualify with their firearms for physical <span id="Page_463"></span>or psychological reasons. As such, the parties continue to have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this negotiability appeal, and we find that the proposal is not moot.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2544 and DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, Tucson</span>, 49 FLRA 545, 548-50 (1994), considered the effect on a negotiability appeal of the decision of the agency to cancel a reorganization that led to union proposals deemed negotiable by FLRA. By the time the agency canceled the reorganization, the case was in court and FLRA sought enforcement of its bargaining order. The court granted FLRA's motion to dismiss the case as moot, but the court left to FLRA the determination of what to do about the underlying FLRA negotiability decision. FLRA decided, over agency opposition, not to vacate its negotiability determination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, in <span class="Italic">INS</span> [46 FLRA 930] the Authority found negotiable a portion of Proposal 1 and all of Proposal 11, which required the Agency to create, respectively, a Union office and an additional employee break room in a facility which the Agency intended to restructure. The Agency filed with the court a petition for review of the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">INS</span> and the Authority filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order. The Union intervened in the court proceeding in support of the Authority's position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the Agency decided not to undertake the restructuring changes which prompted the Union's proposals at issue in <span class="Italic">INS</span>. Accordingly, the Authority moved that the court dismiss as moot the Agency's petition for review and the Authority's cross-application for enforcement of <span class="Italic">INS</span>, with direction that the Authority vacate for mootness the bargaining order in INS. The court granted the Authority's motion and vacated the bargaining order in <span class="Italic">INS</span>. Further, the court dismissed, without prejudice to presenting the matter before the Authority, the Agency's motion to vacate the decision in <span class="Italic">INS</span>. The court remanded the case to the Authority to permit the Agency to seek vacatur of the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">INS</span>. The Agency moved that the Authority vacate its decision in <span class="Italic">INS</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on a review of the Agency's motion, the Union's opposition, and the entire record before us, we will deny the Agency's motion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where cases become moot on appeal, the general practice is for the reviewing court to remand the case to the lower court with instructions to vacate the judgment below. <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States v. Munsingwear Inc.</span>, 340 U.S. 36, 39-40 (1950) (<span class="Italic">Munsingwear</span>). The practice applies to review of administrative orders as well as district court judgments<span class="Italic">. A.L. Mechling Barge Lines, Inc. v. United States</span>, 368 U.S. 324, 329-30 (1961). Such an action is proper because a party should not be subjected to the consequences of an adverse ruling where appellate review of that ruling, otherwise available as a matter of right, fails because of intervening mootness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 330-31. The Supreme Court has not distinguished between the judgment or order to be vacated and any underlying decision setting forth supporting rationale.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Munsingwear</span> rule is not absolute. In particular, two courts have found that in cases where the policy behind the <span class="Italic">Munsingwear</span> rule is not applicable, vacatur of the unreviewed decision is not appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Allard </span>v. <span class="Italic">DeLorean</span>, 884 F.2d 464, 466-67 (9th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Allard</span>); <span class="Italic">United States v. Garde</span>, 848 F.2d 1307, 1310-11 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Garde</span>). Ordinarily, this exception applies where appellate review is prevented not by happenstance, but by the deliberate action of the losing party below. <span class="Italic">Garde</span>, 848 F.2d at 1310. The rationale for the exception is that a dissatisfied litigant should not be allowed to destroy the collateral consequences of an adverse ruling by deliberately taking actions destroying its right to appeal. <span class="Italic">Allard</span>, 884 F.2d at 467. The exception has been applied where the parties have executed a settlement agreement while the case was on appeal (<span class="Italic">Allard</span>, 884 F.2d at 467) and where the losing party has taken unilateral action which moots the underlying case (<span class="Italic">Scott v. Iron Workers Local 118</span>, 928 F.2d 863 (9th Cir. 1991)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Allard</span>, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case with instructions that the lower court determine whether the judgment should be vacated. The court in <span class="Italic">Allard</span> said that the district court should "balance the competing interests of the parties in order to determine whether the judgment below should be vacated." <span class="Italic">Allard,</span> 884 F.2d at 467. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Ringsby Truck Lines, Inc. v. Western Conference of Teamsters</span>, 686 F.2d 720 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">Ringsby</span>) (court dismissed appeal as moot, but denied motion to vacate the judgment of the court below, leaving that decision, should vacatur be sought, for the lower court to make based upon the "consequences and attendant hardships" that would accompany that action).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the actions taken by the Ninth Circuit with respect to the instant case, we think it appropriate to apply the principles of <span class="Italic">Allard</span> here. Like <span class="Italic">Allard</span>, the Ninth Circuit in this case declined to follow a strict <span class="Italic">Munsingwear</span> approach and automatically vacate the Authority's decision. Rather, the court remanded the case to the Authority for consideration as to whether the decision should be vacated. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">Allard</span>, the court left to the forum below certain questions as to the propriety of vacatur. Accordingly, we will look at "the consequences and attendant hardships" as they relate to the interests involved to determine if the decision should be vacated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allard</span>, 884 F.2d at 467; <span class="Italic">Ringsby</span>, 686 F.2d at 722.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency would incur only minimal harm if the decision is not vacated.&#x2003;First, there is clearly no prejudice to the Agency if the restructuring does not occur. Second, the decision finds only that the proposals submitted by the Union are consistent with law and regulations. The Agency remains free to raise any defenses it deems appropriate concerning the duty to bargain should similar circumstances arise in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, while it is true that a refusal to bargain over a substantially identical proposal in the future could subject the Agency to an unfair labor practice charge, we do not believe this should weigh heavily in the balance. Although there has not been appellate review of the Authority's decision, the Agency is not subject to particular prejudice. Any agency is subject to unfair labor practice liability when it refuses to bargain over a proposal which is substantially identical to one previously found negotiable by the Authority, regardless of whether the agency had been a party to the prior decision. Authority negotiability orders are binding on all Federal agencies faced with the same proposal. <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, D.C.</span>, 778 F.2d 844, 847 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The Agency is therefore in no different position with respect to this decision than it would be with respect to an Authority negotiability decision to which the Agency was not a party and thus could not have challenged. Moreover, "'where [an agency's] refusal to negotiate is accompanied by unilateral changes in conditions of employment[,]'" a union can always elect to process the negotiability dispute under the unfair labor practice procedure, even where the Authority has not previously considered proposals that are similar to those involved in the dispute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, Alexandria, Virginia and Illinois Army National Guard, Springfield, Illinois</span>, 42 FLRA 877, 882 (1991) (quoting <span class="Italic">Decision on Petition for Amendment of Rules</span>, 23 FLRA 405, 407-08 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd by</span> <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board Union v. FLRA</span>, 834 F.2d 191 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, there is significant value to retaining the Authority's decision as precedent. The Authority was created by the Congress to provide leadership and guidance with respect to matters arising under the Statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(1). Maintaining the decision as precedent would provide clear guidance to Federal agencies and unions concerning the issues discussed and decided by the Authority in this case. Moreover, with regard to the parties involved in this case, should the Agency decide to restructure a facility, unnecessary delay concerning the resolution of any issue discussed and decided by the Authority in <span class="Italic">INS</span> would be avoided because the negotiability determination by the Authority would have already been made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union here properly exercised its right to obtain a negotiability determination from the Authority. Vacation of the Authority's negotiability decision simply because the Agency decided not to proceed with the change which precipitated the Union's bargaining request and subsequent negotiability appeal would frustrate the Union's right to a negotiability determination.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declined to find moot other proposals that were triggered by a threatened furlough. Even though the furlough never materialized, the proposals were not keyed to a particular furlough and were of general application in the event of a future furlough. <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l VA Council and VA</span>, 41 FLRA 73, 74-75 (1991). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1864 and Dept. of Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 45 FLRA 691, 695 (1992) (although union could file another petition for review if agency later declared nonnegotiable the same or a similar proposal, existing dispute was moot because it was only speculative that events would reoccur that gave rise to initial negotiability dispute).</p>
