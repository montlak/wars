<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-300"><span class="space">d.</span> Effect of Release From Service for Disability</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Restoration rights for employees who return to civilian duty following military service and separation from the military because of physical disability were discussed in <span class="Italic">Heidel v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 669, 671-77 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant began his employment with the agency on November 19, 1988, in the position of Mail Handler, Full Time, grade level M-4, in Knoxville, Tennessee. While occupying this position, the appellant was called to active military duty in the United States Army Reserve as part of the mobilization for Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. On January 28, 1991, the agency placed the appellant in leave without pay (LWOP) status pursuant to his call up to active duty. On September 2, 1992, the agency processed a PS Form 50 for the appellant showing "resignation military" effective January 28, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a May 12, 1993, letter, the appellant applied for restoration to duty. Attached to the appellant's application was a copy of a DD Form 214 Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty showing that he was separated as discharged for "physical disability."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency considered medical reports prepared after the appellant applied for restoration and concluded that he did not meet the physical requirements for the Mail Handler position. On August 12, 1993, the agency offered the appellant the position of Custodian, grade level PS-2, in its Knoxville facility. The agency stated that it would compensate the appellant at a level 4 salary, which was the grade level of his former Mail Handler position. The appellant accepted the job offer and filed an appeal to the Board alleging that the restoration offer was improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency properly restored the appellant after his return from military service. The appellant alleges that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency effected a proper restoration action, in concluding that the agency's failure to restore him within thirty days after receipt of his application for restoration was reasonable under the circumstances, and in finding that the agency did not violate the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act in effecting the "resignation military."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's assertion that the agency did not properly restore him</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not challenge the administrative judge's factual findings. The administrative judge found that the undisputed medical evidence shows that the appellant is limited to lifting and carrying a maximum of twenty pounds on a frequent basis, and that the position of Mail Handler agencywide requires lifting and carrying of up to seventy pounds. Thus, we concur with the administrative judge that it was unnecessary for the agency to have conducted an agencywide search for a Mail Handler position in which to restore the appellant to employment. However, for the reasons set forth below, we find that the agency did not effect a proper restoration action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for restoration under the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act (the Act), 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4307, which states that upon an employee's release from active duty under honorable conditions, he is entitled to all of the reemployment rights and benefits provided for by the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(b)(1). The Act provides, in relevant part, that if an individual seeking restoration is not qualified to perform the duties of his former position by reason of disability sustained during military service, but is qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the agency, he must be offered employment in such other position "the duties of which such person is qualified to perform as will provide such person like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances in such person's case." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(2)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has promulgated regulations implementing the Act. Those regulations, which are set forth at 5 C.F.R. Part 353, Subpart C, state that, in the case of an employee who is physically disqualified for his former position due to disability sustained during military service, the agency must place the employee "in the agency in another position for which qualified that will provide [him] with the same seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances in each case." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.302. The Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Ch. 353, subch. 1-3c(2) (Feb. 24, 1988), which provides OPM's official guidance to agencies concerning their obligations under the Act, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Physically disqualified. If not qualified to perform the duties of the former position by reason of a disability sustained during military service, the individual is entitled to be restored to any other position for which qualified that most closely approximates the seniority, status, and pay to which he or she would otherwise be entitled, consistent with the circumstances in each case. This restoration right, too, is <span class="Italic">agencywide,</span> with first priority in the commuting area the employee left. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The restoration rights set forth in the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, in OPM's regulations, and in the FPM are agencywide. Thus, where an agency cannot restore an employee to his former position at his former facility, and there is no equivalent position at that facility, the employee is entitled to be restored to any position within the agency for which he is qualified that will provide him with either the same seniority, status, and pay of his former position or to any other position within the agency for which he is qualified that most closely approximates the seniority, status, and pay to which he would otherwise be entitled, consistent with the circumstances in his case. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 77, 82 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and the agency does not dispute, that the PS-2 Custodian position was the next best available position at the Knoxville facility. By finding that the Custodian position was the next best position, the administrative judge implicitly found that it was not an equivalent position to the appellant's former Mail Handler position. ([A]n agency may restore an employee to the next best available position at the employee's former facility if the agency cannot restore him to his former position at the facility, and there is no equivalent position at that facility). The record does not show, however, that before offering the appellant the next best available position at the Knoxville facility (the PS-2 Custodian position), the agency determined that no equivalent positions existed in the Knoxville facility or its commuting area, or that it searched nationwide either (1) for a position that would provide the appellant with the same seniority, status, and pay of his former Mail Handler position or (2) any other position within the agency for which he is qualified that most closely approximates the seniority, status, and pay to which he would otherwise be entitled, consistent with the circumstances in his case. The agency has only shown that the appellant cannot be restored to his Mail Handler position or a Mail Processor position, and that the Custodian position was the next best available position. Accordingly, we find that the agency did not properly restore the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Britton v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 170 (1984), the Board found that, unless the parties agree otherwise, the agency must restore a qualifying employee at the facility and position in which he or she was last employed or, if that position is not available, to a position of like seniority, status, and pay, or if such equivalent position is not available, then to the next best available position for which he or she is qualified. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 172. The Board stated that only if no positions are available for which the employee qualifies at the same facility may an agency offer an equivalent position at another facility. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In so finding, the Board relied on guidance provided at 353 FPM App. b-3 dated October 29, 1975.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We could locate no provision in the February 24, 1988, FPM that incorporates 353 FPM App. b-3, as contained in the October 29, 1975, FPM. Rather, as stated above, the Act, the implementing regulations, and the 1988 FPM all entitle the returning employee to agencywide <span id="Page_516"></span>restoration. In a sworn, unrebutted declaration, the appellant states that he would have considered restoration to a position in a facility other than Knoxville if the agency had informed him that he was entitled to agencywide consideration under the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act. In light of this statement, we find that the appellant has not waived his right to elect restoration at another facility rather than accept the next best available position at the Knoxville installation. <span class="Italic">See Jordan v. Department of Justice,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 609, 611 (1992) (sworn statements that are not rebutted are competent evidence of the matters asserted therein).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Withers v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 379 (1985), <span class="Italic">overruled by Farrell v. Department of Justice,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 504, 510-12 (1991), in finding that the appellant's "continuing disability" constitutes a factor that would make a nation-wide search inappropriate. 28 M.S.P.R. at 385 n.2. The nature of an employee's continuing disability was one circumstance set forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">Withers</span> for determining whether a partially recovered employee who seeks restoration is entitled to a nationwide search. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 M.S.P.R. at 385 and n.2. The Board, however, has overruled <span class="Italic">Withers'</span> holding that partially recovered employees are entitled to the same right to nationwide consideration as are fully recovered employees. <span class="Italic">See Farrell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's assertion that the agency did not restore him in a timely manner</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for restoration on May 12, 1993, and the agency made him a reemployment offer to the Custodian position on August 12, 1993. The appellant accepted the agency's offer on August 17, 1993, and the agency placed the appellant in that position effective August 21, 1993. The appellant contends that the agency violated the time limits for restoration set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a), which states that restoration shall occur "as soon as possible" after application "but in no event later than 30 days after the application is received by the agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant was not medically able to perform the duties of his Mail Handler position when he applied for restoration, and that the agency needed to schedule and review medical examinations and tests to determine what positions of like seniority, status, and pay the appellant was medically qualified to occupy. The administrative judge further found that the time used to evaluate the medical evidence and locate a suitable position was not excessive or unreasonable under the circumstances. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the administrative judge's findings on this issue are correct, the appellant nonetheless is entitled under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) to have his restoration take effect no later than thirty days after the agency received his May 12, 1993, application for restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's assertion that the agency failed to afford him all of the statutory rights and benefits to which he was entitled upon his restoration</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that when the agency placed him in the Custodian position, it failed to afford him all of the statutory rights and benefits to which he was entitled under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(b)(1)(A). Because we have determined that the restoration to the PS-2 Custodian position did not constitute a proper restoration under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(2)(A)(ii), we need not decide whether the benefits accompanying restoration in that position comport with the statute. However, when the appellant is properly restored under the statutory criteria set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(2)(A)(ii), he may file an appeal to the Board if he believes that the agency has not complied with the criteria for restoration set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(b)(1)(A) in effecting such restoration. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 686, 692-93 (1992). The time limits for filing an appeal to the Board are set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the agency's "resignation military" action was improper. Once a person meets the criteria for restoration, as the appellant here does, an agency must, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> consider him or her to have been on furlough or leave of absence during the period of military duty. <span class="Italic">See Malko v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 MSPB 161, 3 M.S.P.R. 42, 45 (1980). Thus, to effect a proper restoration, the agency must now consider the appellant to have been on furlough or leave of absence during the period when he was on military duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We ORDER the agency to offer the appellant an equivalent position at the Knoxville facility or a facility within the Knoxville commuting area, or, if such a position is not available, a position within the agency for which he is qualified that will provide him with either the same seniority, status, and pay of his former Mail Handler position or any other position within the agency for which he is qualified that most closely approximates the seniority, status, and pay to which he would otherwise be entitled, consistent with the circumstances in his case. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Upon the appellant's acceptance of such a position, the agency must restore the appellant effective no later than thirty days after the agency received the appellant's application for restoration. The agency must accomplish these actions within 30 days of the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We ORDER the agency to issue a check to the appellant for the appropriate amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and other benefits under Postal Service regulations, no later than 60 calendar days after the date the appellant accepts an offer of a such position. We ORDER the appellant to cooperate in good faith in the agency's efforts to compute the amount of any back pay, interest, and benefits due, and to provide all necessary information the agency requests to help it comply. If there is a dispute about the amount of any back pay, interest due, and/or other benefits, we ORDER the agency to issue a check to the appellant for the undisputed amount no later than 60 calendar days after the date the appellant accepts such position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Heidel</span> resurfaced in an enforcement proceeding in <span class="Italic">Heidel v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 511, 514-21 (1996), considering the legislative history of the 1994 USERRA. At issue was the definition of a position of "like status" for an appellant with a service-connected disability, with emphasis on pay as well as the equivalency of position duties and responsibilities. The Board also determined that "like seniority" would be assessed without regard to collective bargaining agreements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for restoration under the provisions of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (the 1948 Act), as amended, which provides, in relevant part, that if an individual seeking restoration is not qualified to perform the duties of his former position by reason of disability sustained during military service, but is qualified to perform the duties of any other position in the agency, he "shall be restored to such other position the duties of which he is qualified to perform as will provide him like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances in his case." Pub. L. No. 759, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., &#x00A7; 9(b)(A)(ii) (current version at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(3)). These restoration rights are agencywide. <span class="Italic">See Heidel,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 673-74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, where, as here, an agency cannot restore the employee to his former position at his former facility due to a disability sustained during military service, it must determine whether there is an equivalent position at that facility or a facility within the relevant commuting area, and if there is not such a position, then the employee is entitled to be restored either to any position within the agency for which he is qualified that will provide him with like seniority, status, and pay to his former position or to any other position within the agency for which he is qualified that most closely approximates the seniority, status, and pay to which he would otherwise be entitled, consistent with the circumstances in his case. <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 673-77; <span class="Italic">Moore v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 77, 82 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">"Like Status"</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute that he is unable to perform the duties of his former position at the Knoxville facility because of a disability sustained during military service, nor does he dispute that his new position provides him with like seniority and pay to that of his former position. Rather, he argues that his former position and his new position are not of "like status."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, although there are differences in the physical requirements of the two positions, "the appellant's former Mail Handler position and his current position have the same status, that is, the title of Mail Handler in the Mail Handler craft, and that both positions have the same grade. The administrative judge therefore found that the positions are of "like status." A determination as to whether two positions are of "like status," however, involves a more comprehensive test than that employed by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (the 1994 Act), Congress incorporated the term "like status" from prior versions of the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 353, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. &#x00A7; 2(a), 108 Stat. 3157 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(3)). Although Congress did not define the term in the 1994 Act or in earlier versions of the reemployment statute, the legislative history of the 1994 Act <span id="Page_517"></span>indicates congressional approval of a "totality of the circumstances test," in determining whether a returning veteran has been restored to a position of "like status." We note in this regard that although the 1994 Act was enacted after the appellant sought restoration, the legislative history of post-enacted legislation is relevant, albeit not dispositive, evidence of congressional intent concerning earlier legislation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bell v. New Jersey,</span> 461 U.S. 773, 784-85, 103 S. Ct. 2187, 2194 (1983) ("the view of a later Congress does not establish definitively the meaning of an earlier enactment, but it does have persuasive value"). Thus, we will consider the legislative history of the 1994 Act in determining the approach to use in analyzing whether the appellant's former position and his current position are of "like status."[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;As did prior versions of the statute, the 1994 Act required that a nondisabled veteran be reemployed in the position that he occupied or would have occupied if his employment had not been interrupted by military service, or in a position of "like seniority, status, and pay." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2). With respect to veterans who have a disability incurred in, or aggravated during, military service, the 1994 Act, unlike prior versions of the statute, does not use the phrase "like seniority, status, and pay"; rather, it uses the phrase "equivalent in seniority, status, and pay."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4313(a)(3). Because the appellant applied for restoration under prior versions of the statute which used "like status" in reference to the rights of disabled veterans and because the legislative history of the 1994 Act sheds light on the term "like status," we examine that legislative history as relevant to the inquiry in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In particular, House Report No. 102-56 cites with approval a federal court decision in <span class="Italic">Monday v. Adams Packing Association, Inc.,</span> 85 L.R.R.M. 2341 (M.D. Fla. 1973), as taking a "totality of the circumstances" approach in determining if one position is of "like status" to another. H.R. Rep. No. 56, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. 28 (1991). In a passage quoted in the House Report, the <span class="Italic">Monday</span> court stated that the relative status of a job for purposes of veterans' reemployment rights is to be determined by evaluating and weighing the pertinent factors presented in each case, including such considerations as "opportunities for advancement, general working conditions, job location, shift assignment, rank and responsibility, etc." 85 LRRM at 2343, <span class="Italic">quoted</span> in H.R. Rep. No. 56 at 28. The court's use of the word "etc." indicates that its list of "circumstances" is not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 11 F.3d 160 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that a returning veteran had not been properly restored because his new position, unlike his former position, lacked the clear responsibilities, management duties, and necessary authority to carry out those duties. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 163-64. The court stated that "a subsequent position <span class="Italic">must</span> carry with it like responsibility, duties and authority if it is to be of like status and thus meet the requirements of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 164 (emphasis added). Thus, we find that even though an evaluation of other pertinent factors may favor a finding of "like status," if the duties and responsibilities of the new position are not comparable to those of the former position, the positions could not be of "like status." <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In concluding that the appellant's former position and his present position are of "like status," the administrative judge considered only whether the positions have the same title (Mail Handler), are in the same craft (Mail Handler craft), and have the same grade (M-4). While, as discussed above, those factors may properly be considered in determining whether under the totality of the circumstances the respective positions are of "like status," the fact-finder must also examine whether the duties and responsibilities of the two positions are equivalent. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Because the administrative judge did not consider this factor, we do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated that he bid on his former position because it offered interaction with coworkers, an opportunity to work with his supervisor, and a variety of duties. In describing his former duties and responsibilities, the appellant provided unrebutted testimony that the job required that he spend six hours per day on Mail Handler duties involving "breaking down" mail and two hours per day doing other tasks. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant, in his former position he would receive boxes of mail called "flats," which he would "break down. The appellant explained that this task consisted of determining the destination of individual parcels of mail and placing the parcels into bins for further distribution. The appellant stated that for the remaining two hours of his shift he would perform tasks such as assisting other Mail Handlers in sorting "hot mail" that needed to be on the loading dock by 5:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>; working with his group leader; and, at the request of his supervisor, training new employees in the duties of the Mail Handler craft. The appellant testified that his former position provided him with many opportunities to collaborate with his fellow employees and his supervisor in determining how the work should get done and how to reschedule work to ensure that all of the day's mail would be handled. For example, the appellant stated that if either he or his coworkers learned that a truck was delivering mail, they would discuss rescheduling some of their work in order to handle the incoming mail. The appellant averred that he was also developing supervisory skills in his former position by being exposed to and participating in discussions among his supervisors and by being asked to train new employees in the craft.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position description for the appellant's former Mail Handler, M-4, position also lists a variety of tasks expected of the incumbent. For example, the position description states that the incumbent, among other duties and responsibilities, unloads mail from trucks, separates mail for dispatch to other conveying units, separates outgoing bulk mail for dispatch, picks up and carries sacks of mail, handles and sacks empty equipment, operates cancelling machines, assists in supply and slip rooms, operates copy machines and related office equipment, occasionally distributes parcel post mail, operates fork lifts, rewraps damaged parcels, weighs incoming sacks, and may act as an armed guard or watchman.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the duties and responsibilities described by the appellant with respect to his former position and the duties listed in the position description for that position, the January 5, 1995, letter from the agency to the appellant assigning him to his new position states that he would "be assigned primarily to duties on the wrap table" and "be assigned to other duties within [his] medical restrictions as needed." The appellant stated that, unlike his previous position, his current position to date requires that he work all eight hours of his shift at the wrap table repairing damaged mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant described his duties at the wrap table as follows: He sits at the table by himself and receives boxes containing mail that has been torn or otherwise damaged by the agency's automated equipment; he either tapes up the article of mail or, if it is severely damaged, he places it in a plastic bag for further processing; and if a piece of mail becomes separated from its envelope or parcel, he attempts to ascertain the name and address of the sender so the item can be returned to the sender. According to the appellant, he does not interact with his coworkers or supervisors other than to request wrapping supplies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Charles R. Brantley, a Human Resources Specialist at the agency's Knoxville facility, acknowledged that the duties the appellant is currently performing are not the same as the duties he performed in his former Mail Handler position, and that the exposure the appellant has to other duties of the craft has changed by virtue of his assignment to the Mail Handler (unassigned regular) position. Brantley stated, however, that the two positions are equivalent because they both involve Mail Handler work, and that a supervisor would perceive both positions as being in the Mail Handler craft.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his former position, the appellant performed several tasks, interacted with his coworkers and supervisors in making decisions about how to reschedule work to deal with exigent circumstances, trained new employees, and was exposed to the workplace decision-making process so as to better prepare him to be a supervisor if he chose to apply for such a position. In the position to which he has been restored, the appellant sits alone all day at the wrap table doing one thing, namely, handling and repairing damaged pieces of mail. Although the two positions are in the same craft and are of the same grade, their duties and responsibilities are dissimilar enough to warrant a finding that the appellant's current position is not of "like status" to his previous position. <span class="Italic">See Nichols,</span> 11 F.3d at 163-64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">"Like Seniority"</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position description for the Mail Handler (unassigned regular) position shows that the duties assigned to it were limited so as not to violate the appellant's medical restrictions. Mr. Brantley stated that he only evaluated positions within the Knoxville facility to determine which positions might be within the appellant's medical restrictions and that once he determined that the unassigned regular position was equivalent to the appellant's former position and was within the appellant's restrictions, he offered it to the appellant without evaluating other positions either within the Knoxville commuting area or agencywide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brantley further testified that he did not consider offering the appellant positions in a craft other than the Mail Handler craft because if the appellant accepted any such position, he (the appellant) would need to begin a new period of seniority as required by various collective bargaining agreements. In support of this assertion, the agency submitted an excerpted section of a collective bargaining agreement providing that, unless specifically provided elsewhere in the agreement, a full-time employee begins a new period of seniority when he or she changes from one craft to another (voluntarily or involuntarily). The agency argued that if it had offered the appellant a position of like status in another craft and he accepted that offer, he would forfeit his seniority under the applicable collective bargaining agreement and would therefore not be restored to a position of "like seniority," as required by the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 provided that an employer must reinstate an honorably discharged veteran to his former position if he was still qualified to perform the duties of that position, or "to a <span id="Page_518"></span>position of like seniority, status, and pay," and that such person "shall be so restored without loss of seniority." Pub. L. No. 783, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. &#x00A7; 8(b) and (e). In <span class="Italic">Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &#x0026; Repair Corporation,</span> 328 U.S. 275 (1946), the Supreme Court of the United States found that these statutory provisions evinced a congressional intent that, for the purpose of determining seniority, the returning veteran is to be treated as though he had been continuously employed during the period spent in military service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 284-85. Thus, as stated by the Court, the returning veteran "does not step back on the seniority escalator at the point he stepped off," rather, "[h]e steps back on at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept his position continuously during [the period of military service]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 284-85. Congress incorporated this "escalator principle" into section 9(c)(2) of the 1948 Act by providing that a reinstated veteran should be given "such status in his employment as he would have enjoyed if he had continued in such employment continuously from the time of his entering the armed forces until the time of his restoration to such employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress, however, recognized the existence of seniority systems and undertook to give veterans protection within the framework of seniority systems. <span class="Italic">See Accardi v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co.,</span> 383 U.S. 225, 229, 86 S. Ct. 768, 771 (1966) (the term "seniority" in the restoration statute "derives its content from private employment practices and agreements"). Thus, restoration rights are to be exercised within the rights established through collective bargaining. Consequently, just as a collective bargaining agreement cannot deprive a returning veteran of the benefits Congress has provided, the statute is not to be read as granting the veteran an increase in seniority over what he would have had under a collective bargaining agreement if he had never entered the armed services. <span class="Italic">See McKinney v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co.,</span> 357 U.S. 265, 268-69, 78 S. Ct. 1222, 1224 (1958); <span class="Italic">Fishgold,</span> 328 U.S. at 285-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Hembree v. Georgia Power Co.,</span> 637 F.2d 423 (5th Cir. 1981), while the 1940 Act provided adequate protection for a nondisabled veteran, "Congress soon recognized that the disabled veteran needed additional protection."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 426. Accordingly, Congress amended the statute in 1948 to provide that if an individual seeking restoration is not qualified to perform the duties of his former position or is unable to become requalified for that position with reasonable efforts by the employer due to a disability sustained during military service, but is "qualified to perform the duties of <span class="Italic">any other position</span> in the employ of such employer," the veteran must be offered employment in "<span class="Italic">such other position</span> the duties of which he is qualified to perform as will provide him like seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances in his case." 1948 Act, &#x00A7; 9(b)(A) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see Heidel,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 673<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, where a veteran applies for restoration and is unable because of a service-related disability to step back onto the same seniority escalator on which he was travelling prior to his entry into the military and the onset of his disability, the statute contemplates the creation, if necessary, of a parallel escalator in a different department or craft if a position of like status is not available in the veteran's former department or craft. <span class="Italic">See Hembree,</span> 637 F.2d at 428-29. Moreover, as stated by the <span class="Italic">Hembree</span> court, if a returning veteran cannot perform the duties of his former position due to a service-sustained disability and the employer places him in a position of like status and pay in a different department or craft to comply with the statute, the disabled veteran should receive the same seniority in his new department or craft as he would have received if he had been returned to his former department or craft. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In this sense, the placement is not a "transfer" from one department or craft to another and does not invoke the seniority transfer provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 428; <span class="Italic">see also Armstrong v. Baker,</span> 394 F. Supp. 1380, 1386-87 (N.D. W.Va. 1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the 1994 Act shows that Congress has approved of the approaches taken in both <span class="Italic">Fishgold</span> and <span class="Italic">Hembree.</span> House Report No. 102-56 states that "seniority" is intended to include the period beginning with employment before military service and ending with reemployment. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 56 at 20. Thus, the position to which the returning veteran would be reemployed would be the "escalator" position, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> he would step back on the "seniority escalator" at the precise step he would have occupied if he had kept his position during the period of military service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27. Moreover, with respect to a serviceperson who was disabled while serving in the military, the House Report states that if such person must be offered a position other than the "escalator" position, "the nearest approximate position in terms of seniority, status, and pay would be required to be found," and "full company seniority for all purposes is always to be accorded the disabled serviceperson, regardless of whether seniority follows an employee under other circumstances."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> For this proposition, the report cites <span class="Italic">Hembree.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement at issue in this appeal cannot deprive the appellant of the restoration rights that Congress provided to him. Further, because the Mail Handler (unassigned regular) position to which the agency assigned the appellant is not of "like status" to his former Mail Handler position, and because the agency has not shown that it has reviewed all positions, irrespective of craft, in the Knoxville facility, the Knoxville commuting area, and agencywide to locate a position to which the appellant may be entitled under the statute, we find that the agency has not effected a proper restoration. <span class="Italic">See Heidel,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 674, 677<span class="Italic">; see also Hembree,</span> 637 F.2d at 428-29; <span class="Italic">Armstrong,</span> 394 F. Supp. at 1386-87.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Order</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we ORDER the agency to submit to the Clerk of the Board within 20 days of the date of this Order satisfactory evidence of compliance with this decision. The agency's submission must include proof that it offered the appellant retroactive to August 12, 1993, an equivalent position at the Knoxville facility or a facility within the Knoxville commuting area, or, if such a position is not available, either to any position within the agency for which he is qualified that is either of like seniority, status, and pay to his former Mail Handler position or to any other position within the agency the duties of which he is qualified to perform that most closely approximates the seniority, status, and pay to which he would otherwise be entitled, consistent with the circumstances in his case.</p>
