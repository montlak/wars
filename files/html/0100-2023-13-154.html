<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-153"><span class="space">a.</span> Rebuttable Presumption of Annuity Entitlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit did not receive simultaneous appeals of a termination for physical inability to perform work and the denial of a disability annuity. The court did, however, address the "tension" between a termination for physical inability to perform work and an appeal from an OPM denial to the same appellant of a disability retirement annuity in <span class="Italic">Bruner v. OPM</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 291-94 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Instead of estopping the government from challenging the disability in the OPM proceeding, the court rearranged the burden of proof so that OPM would be required to overcome a presumption of disability <span id="Page_2206"></span>arising from the removal action. The bottom line under <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> is that "the government's action in separating an employee for disablement produces a presumption of disability that serves to shift to the government the burden of production. The government must come forward with enough evidence that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the applicant did not qualify under 5 CFR 831.502(b)." Judge Newman, writing for the court, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court is without authority to review the substantive merits of disability determinations, or the factual underpinnings of such determinations. <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. OPM</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 791.... However, it is our obligation to assure that the correct legal and procedural standards are applied. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Bruner argues that as a matter of law the agency's determination that he is physically unable to perform the duties of his job qualifies him for disability benefits. In <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> this court recognized, but did not reach, the question of the relationship between an employee's termination for physical inability to do the job, and entitlement to a disability annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]e are disturbed by the evident tension between (1) a removal for physical inability to do the job and (2) a subsequent denial to the same employee of disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We expressly leave open, for a case in which the issue is properly before us, the resolution of problems inherent in the relationship between the two actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, 776 F.2d at 280. The question was not answered in that case because the employee had appealed only the disability determination and not the termination of employment, and the court believed that it was unable to review both of these actions for possible conflict between them. We deem it unlikely that such a case of conflicting appeals will ever arise for judicial resolution, because of the fatally inconsistent positions and proofs that would be required of the petitioner. However, the "disturbing" question continues to arise, as in the case at bar.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the facial inconsistency between the decision of the Veterans Administration that Mr. Bruner is too disabled to work, and the decision of the Office of Personnel Management that he is not entitled to a disability annuity, it may be that these rulings are not inconsistent in his case, when the correct standards are applied to each determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Piccone v. United States</span>, 407 F.2d 866, 872, 186 Ct. Cl. 752 (1969) ("There is therefore the possibility that a person can be too disabled to continue work, but not disabled enough to qualify for disability retirement.")[.] Thus we decline to hold, as a matter of law, that the agency's action in separating Mr. Bruner on grounds of disability establishes his entitlement to a disability annuity. To this extent, Mr. Bruner's argument must be rejected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency's action in separating Mr. Bruner from employment, based on its decision that Mr. Bruner is too disabled to work, is not irrelevant to the ensuing proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board placed upon Mr. Bruner the burden of proving that he is disabled. Mr. Bruner asserts that the burden of proof should have been upon the government, because a government agency had terminated his employment because of disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court's review of disability-based actions is limited to determining whether "there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error 'going to the heart of the administrative determination.'" <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, 470 U.S. at 791, 105 S. Ct. at 1633, (quoting <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States</span>, 397 F.2d 295, 297, 184 Ct. Cl. 530, <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 393 U.S. 952, 89 S. Ct. 376, 21 L. Ed.2d 363 (1968)). Because the proper allocation of the burden of proof is an important procedural right that may have substantive consequences, we have considered the Board's assignment of the procedural burdens, in implementation of our review responsibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden in most disability compensation programs follows the general rules of evidence. As applied to disability retirement, the general rule is that the burden of proving entitlement is upon the person who asserts that he/she is disabled.... The placement of the burden of proof reflects social policy more than law, and tends to remain fixed despite procedural adjustments along the way....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not aware of, and OPM has not pointed to, any statutory or regulatory allocation of the burdens of proof or of production with respect to disability determinations made pursuant to the Civil Service Retirement Act. 5 CFR 831.502(b) states seven criteria that must be met for disability retirement, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No claim for disability retirement shall be allowed unless OPM determines that the claim should be granted based upon documentation provided by the applicant or the agency which demonstrates the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A deficiency in service with respect to performance, conduct or attendance, or in the absence of any actual service deficiency, a showing that the medical condition is incompatible with either useful service or retention in the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A medical condition which is defined as a disease or injury;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A relationship between the service deficiency and the medical condition such that the medical condition has caused the service deficiency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The duration of the medical condition, past and expected, and a showing that the condition, in all probability, will continue for at least a year;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The applicant became disabled while serving under the Civil Service Retirement System;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;The agency's inability to make reasonable accommodation to the employee's medical condition; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;The absence of another available position within the employing agency and commuting area, at the same grade or pay level and tenure, for which the employee is qualified for reassignment. For this part, placement in the agency is limited to those facilities in the commuting area that are serviced by the same appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Viewing these criteria, it is apparent that some involve evidence within the knowledge and control of the agency, and some within the purview of the employee. All are fact-dependent and subject to dispute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> this court held that the burden of proof, for purposes of eligibility for disability retirement, lies with the applicant, applying the general principle that an applicant for a benefit bears the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefit. The court in <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> did not discuss the allocation of the burden of production as to the seven criteria set forth in 5 CFR 831.502(b), as distinguished from the burden of proof. The burden of production, also called the burden of going forward, is initially upon the person with the burden of proof, and generally requires the production of sufficient evidence to support a finding in favor of that person.... The burden of production then shifts to the other party, who must, in turn, produce enough evidence to raise a question of material fact.... The Board in <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 6 MSPB 343, 6 MSPR 404 (1981), <span class="Italic">cited with approval in</span> <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 776 F.2d at 278-79, setting the guidelines for disability appeals, assumed that the party with the relevant evidence will come forward to produce it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Since it is OPM's decision that we review in such cases, OPM of course remains obliged to come forward with evidence and an explanation demonstrating the basis on which it reached its determination. Indeed, as to some material issues OPM or the employing agency may be in a better position than the applicant to adduce at least some of the relevant evidence, e.g., total creditable service or availability of other positions of the same grade or class in which the applicant might perform useful and efficient service. We hold only that the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant "in the sense of answering the question of who wins if all the evidence is inadequate or unconvincing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Chavez</span>, 6 MSPB at 352-53, 6 MSPR at 416 (quoting 3 Kenneth Culp Davis, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law Treatise</span> 16.9 at 258 (2d ed. 1980)) (footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, this allocation of the burdens of production and persuasion does not take account of the agency's decision and action taken in cases such as this one, wherein the agency has already separated the claimant from service because of disability, the agency having found that the claimant was physically unable to do the assigned job and that there was no other position that the claimant was able to do. Such agency action is presumptively correct, and is not here subject to collateral attack. Thus the Veterans Administration's finding and action based thereon, that Mr. Bruner was physically unable to work and that there was no job within the agency that he was qualified for and physically able to do, produces an evidentiary presumption which serves to shift the burden of coming forward to the government. That is, the applicant is deemed to have met his burden of proof <span class="Italic">prima facie</span>. The burden of production then shifts to the government, to come forward with evidence sufficient to support a finding that the applicant is not disabled in terms of 5 CFR 831.502(b)<span class="Italic">. See</span> Fed. R. Evid. 301. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Meneses v. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare</span>, 442 F.2d 803, 806 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (when the Social Security claimant shows physical impairment disabling him from his former employment, the government has the burden of coming forward with evidence that there are jobs the claimant can do).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the applicant is not absolved of coming forward with evidence and argument in rebuttal of any evidence of absence of entitlement adduced by the agency, the agency must first meet its burden of producing sufficient evidence to support a finding that the requirements of 5 CFR 831.502(b) have not been met. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kerner v. Flemming</span>, 283 F.2d 916, 922 (2d Cir. 1960) ("[A]n applicant for a [Social Security] disability pension has the ultimate burden of persuasion.... However, it does not follow that the court is bound to sustain a denial of disability benefits where the applicant has raised a serious question and the evidence affords no sufficient basis for the Secretary's negative answer."). We do not hold that the ultimate burden of proof is shifted when the agency has separated the employee based on the agency's determination of disability, for we do not <span id="Page_2207"></span>think that the presumption of disability based on agency action warrants this force. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Evid. 301 advisory committee's note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the government's action in separating an employee for disablement produces a presumption of disability that serves to shift to the government the burden of production. The government must come forward with enough evidence that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the applicant did not qualify under 5 CFR 831.502(b). Thus the initial presumption in favor of the claimant will control the result only in cases where the government does not introduce evidence sufficient to support a finding in its favor; in such cases, an applicant who has been dismissed for physical disqualification and absence of an alternative position will generally prevail. However, if the government's evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the applicant is not entitled to disability retirement in terms of 5 CFR 831.502(b), the totality of the evidence produced by both sides is weighed by the trier of fact, who may (but need not) infer disability from the facts giving rise to the presumption. Notes of Conference Committee, H.R. Rep. 1597, 93d. Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1974 USCCAN 7098, 7099. The applicant, who retains the burden of persuasion, will then prevail only if he/she establishes entitlement by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that Mr. Bruner had not introduced sufficient evidence to prove that he was disabled, thus basing its findings on the weakness of his case. Consequently, the Board did not consider the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability that is presumed from the agency's removal action, and did not discuss whether the government's evidence was adequate to support a finding in its favor. This was a procedural error that, as we have discussed, went "to the heart of the administrative determination," <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, 470 U.S. at 791, 105 S. Ct. at 1633, for it is possible that this error affected the result....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision is vacated, and the case is remanded for redetermination upon application of the correct procedural burdens.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board accepted and applied <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> in <span class="Italic">O'Shea v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 352, 354-56 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations governing disability retirement require proof that an applicant has a medical condition expected to last at least a year that has either caused a deficiency in service with respect to performance, conduct, or attendance or is incompatible with useful service or retention in the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.502(b)(1)-(6). The applicant must also show that the agency is unable to make reasonable accommodation to the employee's medical condition and that there exists no other available position within the employing agency and commuting area at the same grade or pay level and tenure for which the employee is qualified for reassignment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at (6) and (7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ultimate burden of proof for purposes of establishing eligibility for disability retirement lies, as the administrative judge found, with the applicant. <span class="Italic">See Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 6 MSPB 343, 6 MSPR 404, 414-17 (1981). Three months before the issuance of the initial decision in this appeal, however, the Federal Circuit revisited the issue of the burden of proof in disability retirement cases where the applicant has been removed for physical inability to perform the duties of the position. <span class="Italic">Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, the court held that an employee's removal for physical inability to perform is <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of disability for the purposes of the same employee's application for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 294. That is, the agency's removal of the employee for disability establishes a rebuttable presumption that the employee was physically unable to work and that there was no job at the same grade or pay within the agency for which he was qualified and which he was physically able to do<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 293-94. The burden of production then shifts to the agency to produce evidence that the applicant is not disabled under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.502(b)<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 294. If the agency produces such evidence, the applicant must then come forward with evidence to rebut the agency's assertion that he is not entitled to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OPM and the administrative judge based the decision to deny disability retirement benefits to the appellant on what they deemed to be the appellant's failure to offer sufficient objective medical documentation linking her symptoms and absence from work with a job-related disabling medical condition. In arriving at this decision, the administrative judge gave significant weight to the appellant's supervisor's failure to state that the appellant was medically unfit for duty and could not be accommodated or reassigned. It is true that, in completing the required statement relating to the appellant's application for disability retirement, the supervisor noted only that "[e]mployee has been on continuous LWOP since 7/18/89" as the explanation of why the appellant was unable to perform her duties. On the same form, however, the supervisor also noted that the appellant's conduct was not unsatisfactory and that her attendance stopped for apparent medical reasons. In addition, in its proposed removal notice the agency stated that the appellant was unable to return to her position "because of the continuing effects of [her] job-related disability," with her return to duty "not anticipated in the near future." Furthermore, the agency had granted the appellant leave without pay for more than two years and had cooperated with her successful application for OWCP benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, therefore, that the agency had determined that the appellant was medically unfit for duty at the time of her separation and that the presumption established in <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> should have been applied in this case. That is, the agency's removal of the appellant "because of the continuing effects of [her] job-related disability," produced a "presumption of disability that serves to shift to the government the burden of production." <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 294. In this case, the government failed to "come forward with enough evidence that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the applicant [for disability retirement benefits] did not qualify under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.502(b)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not every individual who has been removed from service because of a medical condition is "disabled" and entitled to disability retirement benefits. The <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> decision does not establish a <span class="Italic">non-rebuttable</span> presumption. OPM <span class="Italic">can</span> rightfully deny benefits if it can present proof that the appellant has insufficient objective medical evidence of disability under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.502(b). In this case, based on the record before us, we conclude that the government has failed in establishing that the appellant had insufficient medical evidence of disability. Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant has established her entitlement to disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bruner</span> was again applied, OPM's burden of proof again explained, <span class="Italic">Klein v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 366, 370-72 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a disability retirement case, an appellant's separation for disability establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability and shifts the burden to OPM to produce enough evidence that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that he did not qualify for disability retirement. If OPM meets that burden, the Board must then consider the totality of the evidence in deciding the disability issue; the appellant retains the burden of persuasion at all times to establish his entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 294 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In stating that the appellant's removal was warranted based on his psychological inability to work for the Postal Service, then, USPS arguably raised a presumption of his disability, and OPM thus had to meet its burden of production to rebut that presumption. For the reasons set forth below, however, it appears that OPM met that burden and that the totality of the evidence does not establish the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM can meet its burden of production to rebut a presumption of disability by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">See Trevan,</span> 69 F.3d at 526-27; <span class="Italic">O'Shea v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 MSPR 352, 355 (1994). In this context, proof of stress, anxiety, and discomfort at work is not enough by itself to establish disability; the evidence must also demonstrate that these factors are so severe as to prevent an employee from performing the specific duties of the position in question. <span class="Italic">See Clarke v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 MSPR 30, 35-37 (1993), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 22 F.3d 1105 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Faragon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 MSPR 63, 71 (1991); <span class="Italic">Sedor v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 MSPR 42, 47, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 950 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). That evidence must also establish the degree to which the appellant's condition can or cannot be controlled. <span class="Italic">See Clarke,</span> 57 MSPR at 36-37; <span class="Italic">Faragon</span>, 51 MSPR at 70-71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence discussed above shows that the appellant has a mental condition apparently brought on by a work environment that is unpleasant to him, but it does not thoroughly make clear the severity of that condition, nor does it establish the effect of that condition on his ability to satisfy specific work requirements. Similarly, it does not explain why Dr. Brachman has not used alternative means of treatment (i.e., antidepressant medication) in order to control the condition. Under the circumstances, then, the record shows that the appellant has a mental condition, but it lacks a reasoned explanation of how this condition is disabling. Proof of the appellant's stress, depression, and anxiety alone thus is not enough here to establish disability. <span class="Italic">See Clarke</span>, 57 MSPR at 37; <span class="Italic">Faragon</span>, 51 MSPR at 71. OPM met its burden of production by demonstrating this deficiency in some detail, with reference to a voluminous record, in its final decision<span class="Italic">. Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526-27. Because the totality of the evidence discussed above does not establish that the appellant is disabled, the administrative judge therefore did not err by affirming OPM's final decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 527.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marczewski v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 343, 347-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (1998), also considered the relation of a removal based on the physical inability of the appellant to perform assigned duties, the inability of the agency to accommodate the appellant through reassignment, and an appeal from an OPM denial of a disability retirement application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2208"></span>OPM may meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> by submitting any information available to it, including medical and employment records submitted in the first instance by the applicant or the employing agency, as well as medical examinations and other information OPM directs the employee to provide<span class="Italic">. See Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 527 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 1995). OPM will meet its burden of production if these submissions demonstrate "a lack of objective medical evidence provid[ing] a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements." <span class="Italic">See Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 525.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its finding that the appellant is not entitled to disability retirement, OPM reasoned that the appellant's medical diagnoses are merely situational, resulting from the interpersonal relationship with his supervisor. The Board has found that job-related stress resulting in physical and mental ailments that prevent an employee from performing the duties necessary in his job can warrant the granting of disability retirement<span class="Italic">. See Pugh v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 MSPR 184, 187-90 (1988); <span class="Italic">Bridges v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 MSPR 716, 718-19, <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 24 MSPR 112 (1984). Here, the record shows that it was not stress or anxiety alone that rendered the appellant incapacitated for purposes of work, but rather, that the work-related stress and anxiety that he suffered caused his mental condition which was, itself, incapacitating<span class="Italic">. See Pugh</span>, 38 MSPR at 189-89. The appellant's treating psychiatrist, Tom J. Trannel, M.D., stated that, although, after the agency removed him, the appellant tried to work at a job sorting parts, the job precipitated nightmares, headaches, anxiety, and insomnia, and caused him to return to his "baseline level of being quite anxious throughout the day and socially withdrawn." Thus, OPM's evidence is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the appellant is disabled for the position of Supervisory Police Officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also reasoned that the appellant is not entitled to disability retirement because, before the employing agency effected the appellant's removal, it attempted to accommodate him, offering him the position of Physical Security Specialist. OPM found that this position constituted an accommodation under the law of disability retirement because it was not under the supervision of the agency official whom the appellant perceived as mistreating him. As noted above, however, the appellant's disease impairs him in a broader scope than when he is at work under the supervisor who allegedly precipitated his psychiatric disease. Thus, to meet its burden to produce evidence to show that the appellant is not entitled to disability retirement, benefits, OPM must also produce evidence to show that the appellant can render useful and efficient service in that position with his psychiatric disorders<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(a); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2),(4); <span class="Italic">Eshelman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 MSPR 173, 175 (1996); <span class="Italic">Gometz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 MSPR 115, 118-19 (1995). OPM, however, did not submit a copy of the position description for the Physical Security Specialist into the record or otherwise show that the appellant could perform the duties of that position. Thus, OPM's evidence is also insufficient to show that the appellant is not entitled to disability retirement benefits because he could be accommodated by performing the duties of the position of Physical Security Specialist<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even assuming that OPM has met its burden to produce evidence under <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, the appellant has nonetheless met his burden to come forward with evidence to rebut OPM's assertion that he is not entitled to the benefits that he seeks. As noted above, Dr. Trannel reported that the appellant could not work at any full-time position. If the appellant could not work at a full-time position, then he could not be reassigned to one<span class="Italic">. See Moran v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 MSPR 138, 144 (1996). We find therefore that the appellant has submitted evidence to rebut the presumption that he could perform full-time at the GS-9 level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has met his burden of proving that the agency was unable to accommodate him in his current position or through reassignment<span class="Italic">. See Rozar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 MSPR 136, 143-44 (1994); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 54 MSPR 686, 690-91 (1992); <span class="Italic">Biscaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 MSPR 304, 312 (1991). He has therefore established his entitlement to a disability retirement annuity by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Booth v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 13, 16-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9 (2005), applied <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> in a FERS appeal from the denial of disability annuity. The Board granted a PFR when, during the pendency of the PFR, the agency removed the appellant for physical inability to perform his job. The appeal returned to the AJ for reevaluation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an appeal from OPM's denial of a voluntary disability retirement application, an employee bears the burden of persuasion by preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] ; <span class="Italic">Redmond v.

To qualify for a disability retirement annuity under FERS, an employee must establish that: (1) He has completed 18 months of creditable civilian service; (2) while he was employed in a FERS position, he became disabled due to a medical condition, which has resulted in a deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or if there is no such deficiency, the disabling medical condition is incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in the position; (3) the disabling medical condition is expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date the application for disability retirement is filed; (4) accommodation of the disabling medical condition in the position held is unreasonable; and (5) the employee has not declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a); <span class="Italic">Redmond</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 4 &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451.

The Board then considers the totality of the evidence in deciding the disability issue, including objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on his ability to perform in the grade or class of position he last occupied, and evidence that the applicant was not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade or level as the position he last occupied. <span class="Italic">Dunn v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its notice of proposed removal to the appellant, the agency wrote that it "propose[d] to remove [him] from [his] position of Lock &#x0026; Dam Operator, WY-5426-08, at Robert C. Byrd Locks &#x0026; Dam, due to [his] physical inability to perform the essential functions of [his] position and [his] inability to return to work from an extended period of Leave Without Pay (LWOP) and thus perform the duties of [his] position." In support of the proposed removal, the agency referenced a fitness-for-duty examination that indicated the appellant was unable to perform the physical requirements of his position, concluded that the appellant's functional abilities fell well below the guidelines required for his position, and determined that his personal safety and the safety of his co-workers would be at risk if he returned to work and performed the duties of his position. The proposed removal notice further stated that the agency had no position available at the same grade and pay with duties the appellant could perform with his physical and medical condition. Subsequently, the agency removed the appellant "due to [his] physical inability to perform the essential functions of [his] position and [his] inability to return to work" and "to promote the efficiency of the Federal service."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The SF-50 that documents the appellant's removal states that the reasons for the removal are "Inability to Perform your Duties and Unavailability for Work." This document does not state that the appellant was removed for physical inability to perform his duties, and the appellant did not submit a copy of the notice of proposed removal or the decision letter. However, the appellant did submit a copy of his employing agency's response in his Board appeal of his removal. This document states that the agency removed the appellant for being "medically unable to perform the essential functions of his...position."

Once OPM rebuts the presumption established by <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, the appeal devolves to an analysis of evidence presented during or without an evidentiary hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 293-94, an employee's removal for disability, i.e., medical inability to perform her job duties, establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to disability retirement, and shifts the burden to OPM to produce sufficient evidence to support a finding that she is not entitled to disability retirement benefits. If OPM satisfies this burden of production, the totality of the evidence is considered to determine whether the employee satisfied her ultimate burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, her entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 294.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, OPM reiterates its argument below that a removal for "inability to work," as opposed to a removal for "medical," "physical," or "psychological" inability to work, does not justify application of the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption. We find that the argument is without merit because our reviewing court has held that an employee's removal for "Inability to perform his duties" warrants application of the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption<span class="Italic">. Trevan v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 69 F.3d 520, 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1995).

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant has 18 months of FERS creditable service. However, in regard to the remainder of the criteria, the AJ found that, as a result of the appellant's separation from her position by her employing agency due to her medical inability to perform the duties and responsibilities of her position, she was entitled to a presumption that she satisfied the criteria for FERS disability retirement benefits in accordance with the decision in <span class="Italic">Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 294 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the AJ found that OPM failed to present evidence or argument <span id="Page_2211"></span>that rebutted the presumption of entitlement. OPM need not produce additional medical or other evidence in order to meet its burden of production. OPM may meet its burden of production by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 F.3d 520, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6; 10 (2000). OPM met its burden of production in this case by pointing out that the appellant had provided it with medical examinations of her back, neck and head that revealed no abnormalities, and the fact that none of the appellant's medical evidence provided a reasoned explanation of how her claimed neck condition rendered her unable to perform her specific work requirements. Thus, the AJ's finding that OPM failed to meet its burden of production to rebut the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appellant had presented competent medical evidence that supported her subjective testimony of her pain and inability to work in her position. The AJ also found that the fact that the appellant's medical evidence does not provide a reasoned explanation of how her claimed medical condition affects the specific work requirements of her "primarily sedentary" position was of no consequence because the Board found in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996), that an employee's disability retirement does not always turn on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the AJ erred in effectively finding that the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception to the requirement of showing how the employee's claimed disabling condition affects the employee's ability to perform the specific duties of the employee's position is applicable under the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the AJ did not analyze the appellant's position description and determine that her claimed medical condition precluded her from performing the specific duties of her position, the AJ necessarily relied on the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception in order to find that the appellant had presented preponderant evidence of her entitlement to disability benefits. Under the Board's caselaw, there are limited circumstances in which a specific showing as to how an appellant's medical condition affects her particular job requirements is not required, i.e., where the medical evidence unambiguously indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 17 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 120 Fed. Appx. 320 (Fed.

Where the position description and the medical evidence unambiguously and without contradiction indicate that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position, but the medical evidence itself does not describe how a condition affects the ability to perform, the Board will link the medical evidence to the job duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's medical evidence is not unambiguous and without contradiction. The bulk of the above noted diagnostic medical evidence fails to show any injuries from the accidents, let alone injuries that would last for at least one year.... Thus, the medical evidence does not unambiguously and without contradiction indicate that the appellant cannot perform the duties of her position, and the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception to the requirement that medical evidence provide a reasoned explanation of how the employee's claimed disabling condition affects the employee's ability to perform the specific duties of the employee's position is not applicable under the facts of this case. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that OPM rebutted the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption, we must examine the totality of the evidence to see if the appellant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to establish her entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See Trevan,</span> 69 F.3d at 526-27; <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 665, &#x00B6; 6 (2004); <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 7 (1999). In spite of the shifting burdens of production, the appellant retains the ultimate burden of persuasion to establish entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A determination of disability is based on objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, and evidence showing the effect of the appellant's condition on her ability to perform in the position last occupied. <span class="Italic">Hardy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 8 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The objective clinical evidence, MRI and CT scans and physical examinations of the appellant's back, neck and head, has consistently failed to show that the appellant sustained any injury as a result of the automobile accidents that could be expected to last for at least one year.... Indeed, the evidence in this case of the appellant's claimed disability is based entirely upon the appellant's subjective complaints of pain in her neck and the resulting headaches which she claims prevent her from performing the duties of her position. An employee's subjective evidence of disability is entitled to consideration and weight in a disability retirement case when it is supported by competent medical evidence. <span class="Italic">Weaver</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 8. The appellant's subjective claims of neck injury and resulting pain and headaches that prevent her from working are unsupported by the objective medical evidence in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, there is no objective medical evidence that provides a reasoned explanation of how the appellant's condition renders her unable to perform the specific duties of her primarily sedentary position. <span class="Italic">See Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 10. The appellant's primary care physician, Dr. McAllister, indicated his opinion that the appellant is "completely disabled and will be unable to maintain any semblance of employment." However, Dr. McAllister's conclusion that the appellant is disabled is not supported by a reasoned explanation of how the appellant's condition affects her ability to perform the specific requirements of her position. A physician's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the physician explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Weaver</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, with the exception of the appellant's absence from work, the record fails to show that the appellant is unable to perform the duties of her position. Unless there is corroborating evidence establishing impaired performance of the employee's duties, absence alone will not establish disability. <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 10. The record contains the appellant's April 15, 2003 performance appraisal which shows that she was meeting the requirements of all of the critical elements of her position. The record also contains an October 28, 2003 supervisor's statement, that was submitted to OPM as part of the appellant's disability retirement application, that indicates that she exceeded some performance elements until she was unable to work full-time as of January 10, 2003, due to her pain. However, it also indicates that the appellant was then working 5 hours per day and it does not indicate any deficiency in the performance of her duties while at work....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant based his application for disability retirement on "chest pains," which, he claimed, prevented him from coping with the pressures of his GS-13 Auditor position and rendered him disabled to perform any longer in that position. On May 12, 1996, while the appellant's application for disability retirement was pending, the appellant's employing agency removed him for medical inability to perform the duties of his position. On January 8, 1997, OPM issued its final decision denying the appellant's application for disability retirement, finding that, while the evidence showed that the appellant had a service deficiency in attendance, the medical evidence failed to show that he had a disabling condition that prevented him "from performing the critical or essential duties of [his] position...or restrict[ed] or exclude[d] [him] from the workplace altogether." Thus, OPM found that the medical evidence did not support the appellant's subjective complaints of disabling chest pains. OPM further found that the appellant's employing agency had offered him accommodation, which he refused. OPM therefore concluded that the appellant was not eligible for disability retirement. In reaching its final decision, OPM did not take into consideration evidence of the appellant's removal for medical inability to perform the duties of his position, which the record does not indicate OPM had before it....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">While the employee's burden of proof of entitlement to voluntary disability retirement never shifts, evidence of the employee's removal for physical inability to perform the duties of his position constitutes a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability, which shifts the burden of production to OPM to come forward with evidence that is of sufficient weight to support a finding that the employee is not disabled. <span class="Italic">See Bruner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in the employing agency's removal proposal notice, the proposing official stated: "Since your latest medical documentation recommends that you not return to the agency either in your current or any other position due to medical reasons and you requested an application for disability retirement, I can only assume that you are medically unable to return to work." The removal proposal notice also stated that, while the agency was concerned about the appellant's health, it could no longer tolerate the burden of his absence. Further, both the removal decision and the Standard Form 50-B that documented the appellant's removal specifically stated that the reason he was being removed was medical inability to perform the duties of his position. The appellant's removal for medical inability to perform the duties of his position created a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability. <span class="Italic">See Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 294; <span class="Italic">Jones,</span> 75 MSPR at 501....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find, however, that the objective medical evidence of record is sufficient to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing. <span class="Italic">See Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 294; <span class="Italic">Jones,</span> 75 MSPR at 501-02; <span class="Italic">Klein</span>, 71 MSPR at 372. The record contains various medical reports and documentation regarding the appellant's alleged disability. In a February 24, 1996 letter, the appellant's personal physician, James Chaconas, M.D., stated that he has been the appellant's physician since 1979, and that, during this time, the appellant visited him, complaining of severe chest pains. He stated that he "ordered an EKG, stress tests and chest X-rays," all of which were negative. He stated that the appellant was also tested in 1994 when he was taken off an airplane in Dallas, Texas, complaining of chest pains, but that all of the tests performed on him were negative. Dr. Chaconas stated that the appellant again visited him on January 15, 1996, complaining of chest pains, that he "performed a battery of tests," and that the results of those tests were again negative. He stated that the appellant's chest pains subsided after the appellant remained away from his job as he had recommended, and that he recommended that the appellant not return to his job but, rather, find a less stressful occupation. Dr. Chaconas opined that the appellant's job was the cause of "severe stress" that "could lead to permanent damage to his health."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an April 4, 1996 letter that responded to the employing agency's offer of accommodation to the appellant by providing him light duty, Dr. Chaconas stated that, after reviewing the letter and consulting with the appellant, he was not convinced that assigning him light duty would prevent his chest pains from recurring but that, rather, it could increase his stress because the appellant had reported that it was not only his duties that were causing his stress, but his whole work environment. Dr. Chaconas further stated that assigning the appellant "menial work could cause him to be degraded by his peers." Dr. Chaconas recommended "a total change of scenery" for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also submitted a March 26, 1996 memorandum from Christopher Holland, M.D., the employing agency's medical consultant, that responded to the employing agency's request to review documentation relating to the appellant's absence, including Dr. Chaconas's March 11, 1996 letter, and the agency's offer of light duty. Dr. Holland stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have reviewed the "Offer of Light Duty Work." [sic] The new assignment will allow him to report directly to the Director, Readiness Division and not to the supervisors he previously reported to. The nature of his work is also completely different. It does not involve any of the functions listed above [as stated in Dr. Chaconas's March 11, 1996 letter]. It sounds like the work will be largely self-paced. There is also some phone answering responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Holland opined that the accommodation being offered to the appellant was reasonable, that the appellant should be able to perform "productively and healthfully" in the light-duty position, and that there was no need for the appellant to remain on sick leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an April 8, 1996 memorandum, Dr. Holland stated that, after reviewing Dr. Chaconas's April 4, 1996 letter and talking to him by telephone on April 8, 1996, it was clear that Dr. Chaconas believed that the appellant should not return to work at the employing agency and that "he did suggest that with extensive therapeutic intervention by a mental health specialist some type of accommodation might be feasible." Dr. Holland concluded that "there [was] no basis upon which to support additional efforts at accommodation" and that "[t]he agency should move...toward some type of separation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position description for the GS-13 Auditor position states that an individual in that position performs the role of a senior auditor and is an audit team leader. A Senior Auditor/Team Leader "Provide[s] on-the-job training for junior auditors, delegate[s] work, review[s] assignments, hold[s] auditors accountable for completing assignments, and provid[es] input to performance appraisals." The Senior Auditor/Team Leader "independently, and/or with use of the audit team, develops and applies audit techniques of some complexity to accomplish audit objectives related to significant areas of [Department of Defense] operations." The Senior Auditor/Team Leader is required "to interact with high level managers within [the Department of Defense] and perform and supervise audit assignments relevant to audit objectives within all phases of the audit cycle (i.e., planning, auditing, reporting.)" The Senior Auditor/Team Leader therefore, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>: "Develops audit proposals" and "survey/audit guides"; conducts the necessary audit work for these functions; oversees the audit work of his assigned teams; "[c]onducts entrance and exit conferences with audit clients to explain audit objectives and conclusions"; writes audit reports; "[p]rovides clear and concise verbal summaries of the survey/audit results to audit management" and "to audit team members"; and "[m]aintains security and accountability of classified information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, Dr. Chaconas's March 11, 1996 letter indicates that the appellant discussed his job duties with him and that the appellant reported that "[w]riting audit reports and meeting with high level military officials to negotiate audit findings was very stressful" to him and that "[t]he constant pressure from various supervisors concerning his work performance and work habits put undue stress on him." Dr. Chaconas's March 11, 1996 letter merely reiterates what the appellant reported. That letter, as well as the other medical evidence of record, lacks a reasoned explanation of how the appellant's alleged chest pains related to his work and how they rendered him disabled for useful and efficient service in his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's subjective evidence of pain that is supported by competent medical evidence must be seriously considered in a disability case. <span class="Italic">Rozar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 MSPR 136, 141 (1994); <span class="Italic">Biscaha v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 51 MSPR 304, 309 (1991). Here, however, the appellant's subjective claim of chest pains, exacerbated by work-related stress, is not supported by competent medical evidence. All of the clinical findings are negative on the subject of the appellant's chest pains. They reveal no abnormality of the appellant's heart and provide no basis for his claimed chest pains. Further, even assuming that the appellant suffers from chest pains, neither the appellant nor the objective medical evidence of record explains how the appellant is stressed to the point of disability by merely performing the duties of his position<span class="Italic">. See Klein</span>, 71 MSPR at 372 (proof of an appellant's stress, depression, and anxiety alone is insufficient to establish disability); <span class="Italic">cf. Rozar,</span> 61 MSPR at 141-43 (the appellant proved her entitlement to disability retirement based on various congenital disorders, chronic hypertension and stress by presenting medical evidence to support her claimed conditions, and supplementing the objective clinical evidence with subjective evidence of how her conditions affected her ability to meet the requirements of her position, and with evidence that her employing agency strongly indicated that it lacked confidence in her medical ability to perform her duties).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, while the appellant asserts that he experienced some conflict with his supervisors, none of the evidence points to any unusual circumstances under which the appellant was required to work. Moreover, while Dr. Chaconas consistently recommended that the appellant not return to work, he also stated that he had been treating the appellant's chest pains with Zantac, apparently unsuccessfully, but did not indicate whether other treatment, either by medication or other means, was available to treat the appellant's condition and, if so, why he did not provide the appellant with such treatment<span class="Italic">. See Faragon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 MSPR 63, 69 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2213"></span>We therefore find that the totality of the evidence, including evidence of the appellant's removal from his position for medical inability to perform his duties, the appellant's prior absence from his work, the appellant's subjective evidence of pain, and the objective medical evidence, does not establish that the appellant is disabled for useful and efficient service in his position. Because of this finding, we need not consider whether the employing agency could have accommodated the appellant in his position or reassigned him to an existing vacant position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tarlaian</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Tarlaian v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3131):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal to the Board, appellant argued that the fact that his employing agency had removed him from his job because of his medical inability to perform the duties of his position was proof of his medical disability that entitled him to a disability retirement. The AJ did not discuss or consider this phase of the case in the Initial Decision. The Board held that this was an error on the part of the AJ, and for that reason reopened the case. The Board then held that the evidence of appellant's removal for physical inability to perform the duties of his position constituted a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability, which shifted the burden to OPM to produce evidence that is of sufficient weight to support a finding that the appellant is not disabled, citing <span class="Italic">Bruner v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 292-294 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Jones v.

Since OPM has not responded to the petition for review, the Board proceeded to carefully review the evidence in the record before it to determine whether such evidence rebuts appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability, in accordance with the decisions in <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones</span> and <span class="Italic">Klein</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After thoroughly reviewing the evidence, the Board found that the objective medical evidence of record was sufficient to rebut appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of disability to perform the duties of his position, citing <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, and <span class="Italic">Klein</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Accordingly the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We therefore find that the totality of the evidence of the appellant's removal from his position for medical inability to perform his duties, the appellant's prior absence from his work, the appellant's subjective evidence of pain, and the objective medical evidence, does not establish that the appellant is disabled for useful and efficient service in his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board then affirmed OPM's decision denying appellant's application for a disability retirement under CSRS. The appellant then appealed to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, appellant attacks the factual findings and determinations of OPM and the Board relating to appellant's alleged disability. Such findings and determinations are made final and conclusive and not subject to review by the courts by provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 8347(c), which states in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office (OPM) shall determine questions of disability and dependency arising under this subchapter [subchapter III of Chapter 83 cf title 5, i.e., CSRS]. Except to the extent provided under subsection (d) of this section, the decisions of the Office concerning these matters are final and conclusive and not subject to review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court and the Supreme Court have held that this statute limits our review in disability retirement cases by precluding any judicial review of the factual findings of OPM which have been affirmed by MSPB. <span class="Italic">Lindahl v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that we have no authority to review the factual findings of OPM, as affirmed by MSPB, and, therefore, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM also overcame a presumption of entitlement to disability annuity benefits in <span class="Italic">Kibble v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 62, 66-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM can meet its burden of production to rebut a presumption of disability by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">See Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526-27. The second letter submitted from Dr. Ahsan indicates that the appellant cannot work because she suffers from major depression. The submission from Dr. Patell also indicates that the appellant cannot work, in part, because she suffers from major depression. However, there is no indication whatsoever in these submissions regarding how her depression would affect her ability to perform the duties of her position. In fact, the evidence presented by the appellant does not provide a reasoned explanation of how her depression is, in any way, disabling. As such, there is no basis upon which to find that the appellant's depression entitles her to disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has submitted evidence that the agency attempted to accommodate the appellant's RSD and related restrictions by providing her with a position in which she did not need to use her right hand. In addition, the agency identified a van pool that she could use, given that she could not drive to and from work. Two of the appellant's physicians found the position to be appropriate for her. Although Dr. Patell subsequently indicated that the appellant could not work, in part, because she suffers from RSD, he provided no explanation as to how the RSD is disabling or why the agency's offered accommodation was inappropriate for her. Given the evidence presented by OPM and the appellant's failure to show that her employing agency is unable to reasonably accommodate her, <span class="Italic">see Breyer v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 53 MSPR 628, 630 (1992), despite her subjective claims of pain and disability, she is not entitled to disability retirement benefits based upon her injury and resultant RSD.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reese v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3111), emphasized that to establish the presumption of entitlement to the disability retirement, the appellant must be both separated from the federal service and separated for reasons of "disablement":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> we held that "the government's action in separating an employee <span class="Italic">for</span> <span class="Italic">disablement</span> produces a presumption of disability that serves to shift to the government the burden of production." <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 294 (emphasis added). In this case, the Board found that there was no evidence to indicate that Reese had actually been removed by the Postal Service. In fact, the record clearly shows that his proposed removal was deliberately deferred pending adjudication of his disability claim. Furthermore, the reason for his proposed removal was his misconduct, not his claimed disability. Because the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption of disability applies only where the employee has been separated "for disablement," the Board's conclusion that it is inapplicable was clearly correct. Accordingly, Reese is not entitled to a presumption of disability, and the government was not subject to a burden of production to dispute Reese's claim....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement agreement may create a <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> rebuttable presumption. That occurred in <span class="Italic">Bynum v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 1, 5-6 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001), involving a removal for AWOL and other charges resolved by a settlement requiring that the basis for removal be changed to reflect "termination/disability":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM charges that the AJ erred in finding that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to a disability retirement because she considered that the true basis for the appellant's removal was physical inability to perform, when, in fact, that reason was "fictitious, fabricated, and fraudulent." In so arguing, OPM challenges the AJ's application of the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption which provides that an employee's removal for disability, i.e., medical inability to perform her job duties, establishes a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to disability retirement, and shifts the burden to OPM to produce sufficient evidence to support a finding that she is not entitled to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 293-94 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption further provides that, if OPM satisfies this burden of production, the totality of the evidence is considered to determine whether the employee satisfied her ultimate burden of establishing, by preponderant evidence, her entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 294.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although she did not specifically cite to <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, the AJ applied the presumption, based on the reason for the appellant's removal as agreed to by the parties in the document they signed in settlement of the appeal of her removal. The Board has held that it will generally give effect to the terms of a settlement agreement between an applicant for disability retirement and her employing agency in determining the applicant's entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 610, 614-17 (1998), <span class="Italic">recons. denied,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 144 (2000). The resolution of an appeal between an appellant and his employing agency based upon a settlement constitutes a final decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, and the Board has authority to enforce the settlement agreement once it becomes a part of the Board record. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 615.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant and her employing agency resolved the appeal of her removal by entering into a settlement agreement, and because that resolution became a final decision of the Board, we therefore find that the AJ properly applied the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption, and that the appellant established a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to disability retirement. As indicated below by the record, the appellant's evidence indicates that she suffered a medical condition with debilitating effects on her life as well as her job. OPM's PFR raises argument, but pure argument, which constitutes mere disagreement with the<span class="Italic"> id. Weaver, supra.</span></p>
