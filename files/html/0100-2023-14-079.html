<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-78"><span class="space">c.</span> Substantial Similarity of Offenses; Totality of Circumstances</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result of Federal Circuit guidance, the Board retreated from an identity of circumstances, charges, or positions of employees, and instead looks to the totality of the circumstances involving the nature of the misconduct of the appellant and comparators, explaining in <span class="Italic">Arellano v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-12-0211-I-1 (NP 11/27/2013), the requisites of a comparability analysis and recognizing that lack of a proper analysis by the agency will not preclude Board affirmation of an otherwise properly considered and justified penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration</span>, 586 F.3d 1365, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the Board employs a more flexible approach to the penalty factor. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (2010). To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6. There must be enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. The deciding official testified at the hearing that Labor and Employee Relations did not present him with any cases where another employee was charged with "four very serious charges," like the appellant. Agencies should consider not merely whether the comparator employees were charged with the same number of offenses with the same labels but also whether they engaged in similar conduct. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981) (indicating that the Board should consider whether the penalty imposed is consistent with those imposed upon other employees who committed the same or similar offenses). Comparator employees cannot be discounted entirely merely because those employees faced fewer charges than did the appellant or were not supervisors. <span class="Italic">Portner v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2013) (holding that other employees were comparable to the appellant even though they held different positions). Because the deciding official failed to properly consider this penalty factor, the agency's penalty determination is not entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">Von Muller v. Department of Energy</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 91, &#x00B6; 9, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 204 F. App'x 17 (Fed. Cir. 2006), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties submitted evidence of agency disciplinary actions for ninety-eight agency employees who the appellant argues were potential comparators. The administrative judge improperly limited the comparator employees to those comparator employees "charged with multiple charges" rather than focusing on the underlying conduct. We find it unnecessary to review each and every comparator employee and make technical distinctions between them in an effort to fit them into a preordained formula that may provide only surface consistency, both concepts the Board seeks to avoid. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306-07. Rather, consistent with <span class="Italic">Williams</span> and <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, we take a broader approach and consider the evidence as a whole. Though an agency should be as consistent as possible, the Board's role is to review the balancing of relevant factors and to ensure the agency conscientiously considered those factors and administered a penalty within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 306. As reflected by the evidence submitted by the parties, the agency levied a wide range of penalties, from reprimand up to and including removal, against employees who committed some misconduct arguably similar to that committed by the appellant. However, out of all the comparator employees, there are six who are most similarly situated to the appellant based on the two charges that the deciding official felt were the most serious, misrepresentation and criminal conviction. Those individuals, as listed in the record, are employees 1, 14, 26, 31, 83, and 98. Of these six employees, the agency removed all but employee 1, to whom it issued a 14-day suspension. Based on the record evidence, we find that the agency's removal penalty in this appeal is consistent with prior actions and does not support the appellant's disparate penalty claim. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though the deciding official did not conduct a proper review of similarly-situated individuals, his analysis of the other <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors is appropriate. We agree with the administrative judge that the deciding official engaged in a thorough analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors including the appellant's tenure, his role as a law enforcement officer, his job performance, his past disciplinary record, and any other mitigating factors. The parties engaged in thorough discovery to locate similarly-situated employees in response to the appellant's claim of disparate penalty. Based upon the totality of circumstances surrounding the appellant's misconduct relative to the totality of circumstances of the comparator employees, the appellant did not receive a disparate penalty. In addition, the deciding official's penalty decision was not beyond the bounds of reasonableness based upon the appellant's supervisory status and position as a law enforcement officer and was within the range of the agency's table of penalties. <span class="Italic">See McManus v. Department of Justice</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 672, &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (finding that the agency properly held an employee who was a supervisor and law enforcement officer to a higher standard of conduct). For these reasons, we affirm the initial decision as modified, still sustaining the agency's removal of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of similarity of offenses is flexible, involving analysis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the misconduct of the appellant and the comparators, as <span class="Italic">Portner v. DOJ</span>, 119 MSPR 365, 374-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-22, 2013 MSPB 28 (2013) (Member Robbins dissenting) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), to the extent that the disparate penalty analysis should extend beyond the same or similar offenses), explained, considering charges, including misrepresentations in response to a supervisor, arising from alleged misuse of a government vehicle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in considering the appropriate penalty in this case, we must address the appellant's claim that other agency employees who engaged in "much more serious conduct than [the] appellant, were not removed from their position." One of the comparator employees identified by the appellant received a 40-day suspension for unauthorized use of an OGV (making lengthy stops for unofficial purposes), conduct unbecoming a DEA Special Agent (belligerence toward local police officers responding to an off-duty altercation at a bar), and failure to follow written instructions (intoxication and storage of a firearm in an unattended vehicle). The second alleged comparator employee received a 42-day suspension for unauthorized use of an OGV (driving to a strip club and consuming 6 to 8 beers after a domestic altercation), conduct unbecoming a DEA Special Agent (brandishing a handgun at a private citizen, arrest for driving an OGV under the influence of alcohol, and being charged with disorderly conduct with a firearm), and failure to follow written instructions (operating an OGV after consuming alcohol). The final alleged comparator employee received a 31-day suspension for unauthorized use of an OGV (driving the vehicle after consuming a substantial number of alcoholic beverages) and conduct unbecoming a DEA Special Agent (inappropriate conduct with sexual overtones toward an agency investigator).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Two additional alleged comparator employees identified by the appellant apparently had proposed removals reduced to suspensions as part of last chance settlement agreements. The Board has held that, where another employee receives a lesser penalty, despite apparent similarities in circumstances, as the result of a settlement agreement, the agency will not be required to explain the difference in treatment. <span class="Italic">Blake v. Department of Justice</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 42 (1999); <span class="Italic">Dick v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. <span id="Page_2380"></span>322, 325, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 975 F.2d 869 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). <span class="Italic">But see Spahn v.

Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the employees who entered into settlement agreements with the agency are not valid comparators.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding the appellant's claim unpersuasive, the administrative judge reasoned that the three alleged comparator employees were law enforcement officers and the appellant was not and that, unlike the appellant, none of the comparator employees was charged with making false statements. Such a view of comparator employees is unduly narrow. The Board has held that, to establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is "enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the 'outcome determinative' nature of these factors."[5] <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 (2012) (quoting <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15 (2010)). Here, like the appellant, the comparator employees all engaged in unauthorized use of an OGV but also engaged in other misconduct different from that committed by the appellant. A reasoned comparison of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the misconduct engaged in by the comparator employees, as contrasted to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the appellant's misconduct, shows that the misconduct engaged in by the comparator employees was as serious as, and arguably more serious than, the misconduct engaged in by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf. Reid,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 396, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-23 (proffered comparators were not similarly situated for purposes of establishing a disparate penalties claim where the administrative judge sustained three charges against the appellant and the appellant alleged only that the comparators' conduct was similar with respect to one charge). The agency, however, has not offered a sufficient explanation for the significantly harsher penalty given to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Boucher,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 (once an employee establishes a disparate penalty, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;While law enforcement officers are held to a higher standard of conduct, Reid, 118 M.S.P.R. 396, &#x00B6; 26, their special status should not be used as a<span class="Italic"> per se</span> basis for declining to find them valid comparators to non-law enforcement officers, <span class="Italic">see Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, while the appellant committed serious acts of misconduct, the record shows that they were isolated incidents, he was experiencing significant personal and professional stress, and he was suffering from a medical condition that likely impaired his judgment when confronted with another stressful situation. In addition, his performance record during his more than 24-year federal career, both before and after the incident, has been very good. Little suggests to us that if the appellant were returned to duty that he would not continue to provide efficient service to the federal government. Moreover, the agency has apparently imposed suspensions, and not removals, for misconduct by law enforcement officers that appears at least as serious as the appellant's wrongdoing. Thus, while a significant disciplinary action is necessary to impress upon the appellant the wrongfulness of his conduct, we find that the penalty of removal exceeds the tolerable limits of reasonableness. The agency action is mitigated to a 45-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Member Robbins dissented in <span class="Italic">Portner</span>, 119 MSPR 365, 385-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I will not reiterate in detail my objections to the Board's recent treatment of this <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor as expressed in my dissent in <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640 (2012), but I stand by those objections: (1) The Board's new approach is based on the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration</span>, 586 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009), which is inconsistent with an earlier panel decision, <span class="Italic">Facer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 836 F.2d 535 (Fed. Cir. 1988), which indicated that this factor is limited to situations in which agencies knowingly treat similarly-situated employees differently; (2) the new approach attempts to promote a universal consistency in penalty setting, without identifying any legitimate individual interest or broad value under the Civil Service Reform Act that is being promoted; (3) the consistency called for under the new approach might be rooted in an earlier disciplinary decision that was unwise, meaning that a manager might be forced to go easy on an employee who committed serious misconduct because of the unwarranted leniency of some other manager in the past; and (4) the new approach raises the specter of agencies needing to maintain massive databases of past adverse actions to consult whenever setting a penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the objections I raised in the <span class="Italic">Boucher</span> dissent, the "consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses" is simply one of a non-exhaustive list of twelve factors that are relevant for consideration in determining the appropriateness of a penalty, <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06, and the Board has frequently stated that the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibility, is the most important factor in assessing the reasonableness of a penalty. E.g., <span class="Italic">Spencer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 132, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. Under the new approach, the consistency of the penalty with that imposed in other disciplinary actions has become more important than the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibility; indeed, it has become outcome-determinative in assessing the reasonableness of the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I believe that it was inappropriate to consider any of the three comparison employees in this case as reflecting the "consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses" because none of the comparators engaged in the "same or similar offenses." The only misconduct that these comparators have in common with the appellant is misuse of an official government vehicle. <span class="Italic">None</span> of the three comparison employees had committed falsification. As the majority acknowledges, the appellant's misuse of the government vehicle was a relatively minor offense under the circumstances; the falsification charge was by far the more serious of the two charges. By considering the penalties imposed on the three comparators, the majority has converted an analysis of the "consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the <span class="Italic">same or similar offenses</span>" into an analysis of the consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for what the majority considers to be <span class="Italic">comparable offenses</span>. There is no support in case law or public policy for such an approach.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caban v. DOJ</span>, AT-0752-13-0002-I-1 (NP 5/27/2014), summarized the "totality of the circumstances" approach to disparate discipline defenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency appears to contend that a claim of disparate penalty may only succeed when the number and nature of the charges are identical, such a view of comparator employees is unduly narrow and improperly relies upon a hard and fast rule. <span class="Italic">See Portner v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 21 (2013). In <span class="Italic">Portner</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 21, the Board rejected a finding that a disparate penalty claim was unpersuasive because the three alleged comparator employees were law enforcement officers and the appellant was not, and that, unlike the appellant, none of the comparator employees was charged with making false statements. The Board held that a reasoned comparison of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the misconduct engaged in by the comparator employees, as contrasted with the totality of the circumstances surrounding the appellant's misconduct, showed that the misconduct engaged in by the comparator employees was as serious as, and arguably more serious than, the misconduct engaged in by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 21. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Raco v. Social Security Administration</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 17-20 (2011), the Board found that the appellant, who was removed for twenty-two time discrepancies supporting a charge of conduct unbecoming, was comparable to an employee who was suspended for 2 days for a single instance of providing inaccurate information on an official government record. The Board mitigated the removal to a 14-day suspension, finding that the fact that the employee who was suspended for 2 days did not have a prior disciplinary record, while the appellant had a prior letter of reprimand, justifying a harsher penalty for the appellant, but not a removal in light of the other employee's 2-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as the administrative judge found, the appellant must show that there is "enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the 'outcome determinative' nature of these factors," <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15 (2010). Under this standard, the administrative judge properly relied upon the comparators in question, finding that the agency imposed only 14- and 1-day suspensions on an Employee Services Manager and a correctional officer for misconduct, providing inmates with access to addresses and social security numbers of correctional institution staff and bringing a cell phone into the institution, that was arguably more deleterious to the maintenance of good order and discipline in a penal institution than the appellant's introduction of a Play Station Portable gaming device. The fact that the administrative judge sustained two charges in addition to the Introduction of Contraband charge, although warranting a harsher penalty than the 14- and 1-day suspensions of the comparators, does not warrant removal. <span class="Italic">See Raco</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the consistency of a penalty with those imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses is only one factor to be considered in determining the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty. <span class="Italic">Yeager v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's allegation that the agency treated her disparately to another employee, without a claim of prohibited discrimination, is an <span id="Page_2381"></span>allegation to be proven by the appellant and considered by the Board in determining the reasonableness of the penalty, but it is not an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of Veterans</span> Affairs, 112 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 11 (2009), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and the surrounding circumstances are substantially similar so that a reasonable person would conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">See Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">see also Williams v.

If the appellant does so, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6. To trigger the agency's burden, there must be a great deal of similarity, not only between the offenses committed by the appellant and a proposed comparator, but as to other factors, such as whether the employees were in the same work unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there appears to be substantial similarity in the conduct in which the appellant and the comparators participated. However, the record is not fully developed as to the following issues: (1) what discipline, if any, the agency imposed on the senior corrections officer for his admitted similar misconduct; (2) the approximate date that the individual referred to by Mr. Clay allegedly engaged in similar misconduct; (3) what was the exact nature of that misconduct; and (4) what disciplinary action, if any, was imposed by the agency for the misconduct. Because the facts necessary to resolve the question of whether the appellant was subjected to a disparate penalty and whether the agency met its corresponding burden to show a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment are not in the record, it is necessary to remand this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Villada v.

Department of the Air Force</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983).

Once the agency's burden is triggered, the Board will consider whether the agency actually treated similarly-situated employees differently, whether the difference in treatment was knowing and intentional, whether the agency began levying a more severe penalty for an offense without giving notice of a change in policy, and whether an imposed penalty was appropriate for the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15 &#x0026; n.4 (noting that these factors are consistent with the court's rationale in <span class="Italic">Williams v.

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15 (2010). An appellant does not demonstrate disparate penalties when an alleged comparator engaged in similar conduct regarding only some of the charges for which she was disciplined. <span class="Italic">Reid v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 396, &#x00B6; 22 (2012). In this case, even though two of the comparators engaged in an altercation and the appellant alleges that another comparator made inappropriate comments, there is certainly no evidence that they engaged in conduct consistent with the charge of causing a delay in patient medications. We find that the appellant has not described any comparators with a history of similar misconduct as to all of the charges against her. These alleged comparators therefore do not demonstrate that the appellant was subjected to a disparate penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Additionally, the appellant has not established a similarity between her history of discipline and that of the other employees. In particular, we note that the appellant has a history of previous discipline that includes suspensions for conduct involving altercations and violence. There is no evidence that the alleged comparators had such a history. The appellant has therefore not established that she was subjected to a disparate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ramos v. DHS</span>, AT-0752-13-0637-I-1 (NP 11/21/2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting), presented quite different approaches to comparability analysis by the majority and dissenting opinions. First, from the majority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant's principal argument is that the removal imposed on her was disparate compared to the penalties imposed on other ICE employees who were charged with lack of candor, but not removed. To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors, such as whether the appellant and the comparator were in the same work unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time, to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 (2012); <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15. The Board does not have hard and fast rules regarding the "outcome determinative" nature of these factors. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 15. If an appellant makes this showing, the burden shifts to the agency to prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Villada v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the appellant failed to trigger the agency's burden to prove a legitimate reason for any alleged difference in treatment because she failed to make an initial showing that a similarly-situated employee was treated more favorably. Specifically, he found that none of the proposed comparator cases involved the same work unit, supervisors, degree of blatancy, or the same type of misconduct, which he characterized as making false or misleading statements to an outside law enforcement agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly limited the pool of comparators and characterized her misconduct in an "unduly narrow" manner. We disagree. The administrative judge's characterization of the first charged misconduct--making false or misleading statements to an outside law enforcement agency--appears to be an accurate and reasonable statement of the appellant's misconduct. Moreover, contrary to the appellant's argument, the administrative judge did not violate the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Villada</span>, by treating a comparator's geographic location as a dispositive factor; he explicitly considered several factors, including the nature of the misconduct and the degree of blatancy, as well as "geographic" factors such as the proposed comparators' work unit and chain of command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her disparate penalty claim, the appellant argues that other employees in similar positions were charged with lack of candor, in addition to other charges, but were not removed. It is well-settled, however, that the similarity of comparative employees in a disparate treatment case is governed by the nature of their conduct and related circumstances, not by the label the agency ascribes to the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Small Business Administration</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 19 (2014) (considering the specific nature of the misconduct when analyzing a disparate penalty claim); <span class="Italic">see also Spahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 14 (2003) (concerning disparate penalty analysis under Title VII discrimination law). Here, the extent of the appellant's similarly-situated analysis consists of pointing out that the proposed comparators were agency law enforcement officers charged with lack of candor, as well as one or more other charges. The appellant has neither alleged, nor conducted a factual analysis to show, that her misconduct is substantially similar to the misconduct underlying the lack of candor charges levied against her proposed comparators. Accordingly, she has not established that the proposed comparators engaged in substantially similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Moreover, upon independent review of the underlying misconduct engaged in by the proposed comparators apparently identified by the appellant, we find that none engaged in misconduct substantially similar to hers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although lacking in specificity, the appellant refers to 11 proposed comparator employees in her petition for review. Five of the proposed comparators obtained penalties less than removal as the result of <span id="Page_2382"></span>settlement agreements with the agency, and thus are not valid comparator employees. <span class="Italic">See Davis</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 10 (where another employee receives a lesser penalty, despite apparent similarities in circumstances, as the result of a settlement agreement, the agency will not be required to explain the difference in treatment); <span class="Italic">Portner v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365 &#x00B6; 20 n.4 (2013) (same). Five other purported comparators engaged in a lack of candor to an agency supervisor, investigator, or the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) during an inquiry into other misconduct. Unlike the appellant, however, none of those employees lacked candor by attempting to mislead a state law enforcement officer about off-duty misconduct to avoid the consequences of unlawful activity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to show sufficient similarity between her case and those of her purported comparators so as to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. Accordingly, the appellant did not demonstrate that the penalty imposed upon her was inconsistent with penalties imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Vice Chairman Wagner dissented in <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, arguing that the Board improperly placed the burden of proof on the appellant to demonstrate disparate treatment among alleged comparators:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the grounds upon which the appellant challenged the penalty of removal as unreasonable was that the agency had imposed a more severe penalty on her than it had imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses. The majority finds that the administrative judge's characterization of the charge--making false or misleading statements to an outside law enforcement agency--is an accurate and reasonable statement of the appellant's misconduct. It also acknowledges that the appellant identified, among others, a comparator whose misconduct involved misleading statements to an outside law enforcement organization and subsequent lack of candor regarding those statements to an internal investigator. It nonetheless inexplicably concludes that the appellant failed to show sufficient similarity between her case and those of her purported comparators as to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, rather than remanding for further development of the record, the majority instead affirms the administrative judge's determination that the appellant has not met <span class="Italic">her</span> burden of demonstrating that the penalty imposed upon her was inconsistent with penalties imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses, and that she therefore failed to trigger the agency's burden to prove a legitimate reason for any alleged difference in treatment. The majority's analysis and conclusions cannot be reconciled with U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or Board precedent, which places the evidentiary burden on this issue upon the agency, not the appellant, and which requires that such determinations be based on evidence contained in a fully-developed record, rather than on mere speculation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disparate penalties argument is not an affirmative defense. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Small Business Administration</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 9 (2014); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 307-08 (1981) (the agency bears the burden of proving the appropriateness of the penalty). Although the appellant must raise the disparate penalties issue, the agency bears the evidentiary burden on the matter. <span class="Italic">Miille v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 248, 251 (1985); <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 458, 463 (1981); <span class="Italic">Woody v. General Services Administration</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 486, 488 (1981). To "trigger" the agency's evidentiary burden on disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors, such as whether the appellant and the comparator were in the same work unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time, to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 &#x0026; n.4 (2012); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 15 (2010). I believe that the appellant's evidence clearly triggered the agency's burden in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority's conclusion that the appellant failed to demonstrate that the penalty imposed upon her was inconsistent with penalties imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses turns longstanding Board precedent on its head, transforming an appellant's obligation to raise the disparate penalties issue into an evidentiary burden of proof on the matter. This is especially inappropriate when the issue is the consistency of the penalty because it is the agency, not the appellant, that possesses information concerning comparator employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any agency reason for the difference in treatment, the majority offers its own. Speculation as to why the agency might have imposed different penalties, however, is no substitute for record evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Williams</span>, 586 F.3d at 1369 ("We decide cases on the record before us, not on the basis of facts stated by counsel. The record before the Board, which is the only record we have, does not establish government counsel's factual description of what occurred, and we cannot base our decision on those statements.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">McNab</span>, I neither express nor intimate any views as to what would be an appropriate resolution of this case, but only my view that the appropriate disposition of this case is to remand it to the administrative judge for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">See McNab</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6; 9 (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting). On remand, the administrative judge should: (1) develop, as fully as possible, the facts relating to whether the agency conscientiously considered the consistency of the penalty here with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses; (2) make findings and conclusions on that issue; and (3) based on that augmented record and those findings and conclusions, redetermine whether the agency met its burden to establish the appropriateness of the penalty in this case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under similar circumstances, the Board in <span class="Italic">Voss v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 324 (2013), recently remanded an appeal for the administrative judge to reconsider the reasonableness of the penalty in light of the appellant's claim of disparate penalties, with instructions to allow the parties to submit supplemental evidence and argument, including a hearing, if requested, so that the administrative judge could analyze the appellant's claim based on a fully-developed record. I believe that the Board should take the same approach in this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence also supports the Board's decision that Mr. Robinson did not meet his burden to show disparate treatment among similarly-situated individuals. Mr. Robinson argues that other individuals just as, if not more, culpable for the charged offenses were not removed, and therefore his removal was unreasonable. Mr. Robinson once again appears to misunderstand the allegations against him. He contends that no other supervisors in other VA medical centers suffering from scheduling issues were disciplined for negligent supervision. As discussed above, however, Mr. Robinson is charged with negligently performing his <span class="Italic">own</span> duties, not for failure to supervise employees. Therefore, any "similarly-situated employees" he identified were likely not charged with similar misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence also belies Mr. Robinson's argument. The Board credited Mr. Gibson's testimony that other employees charged with similar misconduct either retired or resigned before the agency could remove them. Therefore, there was no opportunity for the VA to treat those involved inconsistently because those individuals voluntarily left the VA. The record also shows that the VA removed other managers at Phoenix VA involved in the scheduling failures, including Mr. Curry. In contrast, Mr. Robinson fails to identify as comparators particular individuals in upper management at the VA accused of similar misconduct who were <span id="Page_2383"></span>not removed. <span class="Italic">See Boucher v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 2012 M.S.P.B. 126, &#x00B6; 20 (2012) ("To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is 'enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently.'"

He appears to only make general allegations that "he had been treated much more harshly than others in similar circumstances."

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 14 MSPR 291, 293-94 (1983), offered a representative analysis rejecting a disparity defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant relies heavily on cases from another district of the respondent agency in which charges of sleeping on duty have led only to brief suspensions. However, the appellant has failed to show that the circumstances in those cases were substantially similar to the instant case. There is no evidence in the record indicating whether persons charged in those cases had extensive histories of misconduct or any disciplinary records at all. Moreover, other than statements by the appellant's counsel, there is no evidence that the charges in those cases were, in fact, identical to the charges against the appellant. Even if we assume that the charges were identical, the factual underpinning of the charges appears to differ substantially from the instant charge. Unlike the cases upon which the appellant relies, this is one in which an individual fell asleep while on duty and in a potentially life endangering situation. As the Board previously stated in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981), superficial uniformity, without consideration for the underlying factors of a given case, should be eschewed. Thus, a single charge may reasonably provide a range of penalties, each of which may be appropriate in a particular set of circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's charged "contemptuous behavior toward constituted authority" was distinguished from use of offensive language, making racial remarks, and altercations with coworkers, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD</span>, 66 MSPR 546, 549-52 (1995) (<span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3339)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ccording to the administrative judge, the agency had an unwritten policy of leniency and progressive discipline toward such misconduct. We find that the administrative judge erred in this analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge based his finding of a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> policy of leniency on documentary evidence submitted by the appellant that six other agency employees had been disciplined since 1990 on charges of fighting, physically assaulting a co-worker, using offensive language, quarreling, and making insulting racial remarks. These employees had received penalties ranging from a 3-day suspension to a 10-day suspension. We find, however, that this evidence by itself does not establish any kind of agency disciplinary policy regarding misconduct similar to the appellant's because nothing in the record indicates that these six examples are a representative sampling of the agency's disciplinary actions. Furthermore, we find that these incidents are sufficiently distinguishable from the facts in this appeal to undercut any implication that the agency treated misconduct like the appellant's leniently: None of the incidents involved insubordination; none of the incidents involved an altercation with a supervisor or a security officer; four of the employees were disciplined for isolated incidents arising out of an argument between co-workers; two of the employees had significantly more years of service than the appellant; and four of the employees had no record of prior discipline. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> that consistency is only one of the factors to be considered and that of primary importance is the preservation of the substance of equity in relation to genuinely similar cases when all of the relevant factors are considered. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306-07. The Board has held that consistency of a penalty will not be a basis for mitigation when the penalty is otherwise appropriate to the seriousness of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Padilla v. Dept. of Justice,</span> 64 MSPR 416, 424 n.5 (1994). While we acknowledge that the inconsistency between the most severe penalty imposed among these six employees, a 10-day suspension, and the removal penalty imposed on the appellant is considerable, we cannot agree with the administrative judge that such inconsistency rises to the level of unreasonableness, given the distinguishing circumstances and the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Offenses of an appellant and another employee were distinguished, <span class="Italic">Beckham v. VA,</span> PH-0752-10-0303-I-1 (NP 5/13/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We grant the appellant's petition for review for the limited purpose of considering his new evidence regarding the disciplinary history of another employee as it relates to his claim of disparate penalty. We find, however, that this new evidence does not change the outcome of the appeal and that the agency has shown a legitimate reason for the difference in penalties. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge assumed that the comparison employee (Employee X) was only charged with one specification of willful idleness. The appellant asserts that the new evidence establishes that Employee X's disciplinary history was "far more daunting." The record reflects, however, that the agency's deciding official found that different penalties were warranted based on other legitimate factors unrelated to the appellant's new evidence regarding Employee X's disciplinary history, including the appellant's lack of remorse and a substantial difference between the appellant's length of service (6 years) and Employee X's length of service (24 years). We find that the agency has proven that it had a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment between the appellant and Employee X and, as otherwise explained in the initial decision, the deciding official considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors most relevant to this case and the agency reasonably exercised its management discretion.<span class="Italic"> See generally Douglas v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board was occasionally compelled to retreat from its substantial similarity analysis. Grudgingly perhaps, the Board accepted an EEOC finding of discrimination based on disparate treatment of similar though not identical offenses: the appellant, discharged for conduct unbecoming a postal employee--shouting at subordinates in a threatening manner and shoving a cardboard casing box at one of them--demonstrated that three white employees, all charged with assault on an employee or supervisor, were not disciplined for their offenses. <span class="Italic">Wilson v.

DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 195, 202-03 &#x00B6; 14 (2003), the Board recognized that agencies may not avoid scrutiny for discriminatory practices in violation of Title VII by taking essentially the same conduct for one employee and placing a different label upon that conduct for a comparator: "it is the similarity of the comparative employee's conduct that is controlling, not what charges the agency chose to bring against the employee." [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a> for treatment of EEO affirmative defenses in disciplinary appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, and likely after <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, an agency may refute a charge of disparate treatment by establishing a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment, either by showing that the offenses in question were not really equivalent or by showing that mitigating or aggravating factors justified a difference in treatment. <span class="Italic">Rasmussen v. USDA</span>, 44 MSPR 185, 192 n.9 (1990). Although disparate penalties for the same offenses do not promote the efficiency of the service, past work records may be considered in the determination of unequal penalties. <span class="Italic">See Greene v. DHHS</span>, 3 MSPR 379, 381, 3 MSPB 459 (1980) (although improvement in work following a proposed adverse action may be worthy of some consideration, it is not entitled to the consideration due to another employee's consistently good performance). Past discipline is used to distinguish treatment of comparable current offenses. If an employee attempts to establish the defense of disparate penalties, he should show circumstances that are as similar to his own as possible. Although one individual is responsible for a particular offense also charged to the appellant, if the appellant has additional, other charges and a poor disciplinary record, the appellant's enhanced penalty will not be set aside. <span class="Italic">Clancy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 196, 201-02, 6 MSPB 173 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Yeager v.

<p class="Body-Text">Should charges be broadly stated, the underlying conduct charged rather than the nature of the charge should be examined. If an employee is removed for "conduct unbecoming a federal employee," consisting of striking a supervisor with some papers, the analysis of disparate penalties must focus on similar incidents; it is not a basis for comparison that a person charged with "conduct unbecoming a federal employee" received a lighter penalty for failure to follow directions. <span class="Italic">Nordell v. DHHS</span>, 15 MSPR 37, 41 (1983). In <span class="Italic">Parsons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 21 MSPR 438, 443, 445 (1984), on remand from 707 F.2d 1406 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the Board found disparate treatment and mitigated the penalty, but the Board discarded the argument that offenses could be compared (e.g., AWOL and insubordination) because they involved a very general common element, such as violation of a regulation. The Board noted that "[v]irtually any sort of misconduct can be characterized as a failure to obey some order, rule, regulation, or standard. It does not follow, however, that insubordination on the one hand, and AWOL combined with falsification on the other hand, should both be characterized for penalty purposes as 'deliberate attempts to evade orders from a supervisor for purely personal reasons.'" In <span class="Italic">Parsons</span>, the Board examined a specific offense, AWOL, and concluded the agency's treatment of about 60 other individuals with AWOL offenses to be inconsistent, but to "reveal a tendency on the part of the agency to suspend rather than remove employees who commit minor AWOL and/or falsification offenses."</p>

He does not claim that any of the individuals he cites as comparators misdirected funds or falsified an official form with respect to such payment.
