<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-65"><span class="space">G.</span> GROSS PROCEDURAL ERROR</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">A finding of error sufficient to warrant counsel fees must be more than harmful procedural error sufficient to warrant reversal of an adverse action; otherwise an employee whose appeal was sustained due to harmful error would automatically receive counsel fees, a result not intended by Congress. <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 214, 219 (1989) (harmful procedural error that required the reversal of agency action did not necessarily warrant fees under the "gross procedural error" category); <span class="Italic">Bourg v. DHUD</span>, 3 MSPR 428, 429, 3 MSPB 502 (1980) ("Moreover, the presiding official's conclusion that the agency's procedural error warranted an award of fees is contrary to our determination that such a conclusion must be based on more than 'harmful' procedural error such as merely suffices to require reversal of the agency action under 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, at 593 n.36. Otherwise, the 'interest of justice' standard would be read out of the statute whenever the employee satisfies the 'prevailing party' requirement by prevailing on grounds of the agency's procedural error."). To satisfy the "gross procedural error" test, an appellant must identify a procedural error and establish that the error amounts to more than "simple harmful error" warranting reversal of an agency action. <span class="Italic">Olson v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 261, 265 (1994). To justify fees on the basis of gross procedural error, the fee petition should demonstrate evidence that the proceeding was prolonged or that the appellant was severely prejudiced. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 407, 408-09, 4 MSPB 463 (1980). The error involved in the test is one of procedure. If the agency violates the substantive rights of the employee, the test is inapplicable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Olson v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 261, 265 (1994) (awarding fees on another ground; however, a violation of the regulatory restoration rights of a partially recovered employee did not constitute gross procedural error).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 214 (1989), summarized the gross procedural error resulting from the agency's failure to serve its evidence file on the appellant prior to his oral hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency's transgression in this regard could be considered harmful procedural error, only a finding of "gross procedural error," i.e., error that "prolonged the proceeding" or "severely prejudiced" the employee, will suffice to warrant fees under the guidance of <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 434-35 and n.6 (1980). The Board has made this distinction clear, holding that even harmful procedural error that requires reversal of the entire agency action against an appellant does not necessarily warrant a fee award under the "gross procedural error" category<span class="Italic">. Poole v. Department of the Army</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 355, 357 (1984). Rather, that criterion requires weighing the nature of the error and any excuse for it against the prejudice and burden resulting for the employee<span class="Italic">. Ingram v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 641 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's failure to serve its case file on the appellant before the oral hearing was deemed by the administrative judge to be inadvertent; further, the only prejudice that it ultimately caused was to the agency itself, in that its evidentiary file was excluded from consideration by the administrative judge. Nor was there any showing in this case that the agency's negligence prolonged the proceedings in any appreciable way. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Lampack v. United States Postal Service</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 654 (1986) (agency's failure to submit agency file in timely manner, its failure to participate in the hearing or to respond to the appellant's fee motion, and its failure to consider alternative penalties did not constitute "gross procedural error" where there was no showing that any of the omissions prolonged the proceedings or severely prejudiced the employee).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's definition of gross procedural error is a product of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> and the Board's attempt to inject substance and meaning into a remark by a legislator during a markup committee meeting on the Reform Act. How does one show that a proceeding is "prolonged" if the proceeding should not have been brought at all? How does one go about trying to disprove the obvious: that an appellant who has lost his job and income is "severely" prejudiced? Conversely, how does an agency disprove a suggestion that any adverse proceeding is "prolonged," or that any person unjustifiably dismissed is not "severely" prejudiced? Rather than stating what gross procedural error actually is, many decisions state what it is not--often hinging on a conclusory and elusive distinction between harmful error, sufficient to invalidate an action, and gross procedural error, sufficient to establish fee entitlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The definition of gross procedural error can be convoluted. In <span class="Italic">Lampack v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 654, 656 &#x0026; 656 n.6 (1986), the agency failed to defend its action before the Board. Nevertheless, the Board discerned no gross error in the conduct of the proceedings, reasoning that it was the agency, rather than the appellant, who was prejudiced by the conduct. An interesting result: the agency was prejudiced by an improper adverse action, but not the employee? One must be a hardened bureaucrat to fail to find that analysis ironic. A different result was reached in <span class="Italic">Aubrey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 65, 66 (1985), awarding fees under the gross procedural error standard after the Board reversed appellant's removal for conversion of government property. Fees were warranted because of the paucity of the agency's investigation and the prolonged adverse action process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[U]nder the special circumstances of this case, we find that the agency's 2 1/2 year delay in bringing the charges amount[s] to gross procedural error which severely prejudiced appellant's rights. As the presiding official found: the agency offered no legitimate excuse for the delay; the delay caused it to be unable to produce certain potentially exculpatory evidence; the delay was contrary to its own internal regulations; and despite the delay, misconduct was charged without any competent investigation or inquiry by the agency's proposing and deciding officials.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some clarification arrived with <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 134 (1987), discussed below as to enforced leave, but summarized in <span class="Italic">Swanson v. DLA</span>, 35 MSPR 115, 118 (1987), noting as to a fee application following reversal of a removal for failure of the agency to provide adverse action reply rights to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Allen</span>...attorney fees may be awarded to a prevailing employee when an agency's action is reversed on the basis of a gross procedural error. To determine whether a gross procedural error has occurred, a balance is struck between the agency's excuse for committing the error and the prejudice and burden that the error caused the appellant. <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 132 (1987). If, in the balance, the prejudice and burden to the appellant predominates, gross procedural error exists and the appellant is entitled to a fee award.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency takes issue with the statement of this test. According to the agency, as long as it was following existing authority when it took the action any mistake cannot be considered gross procedural error. That line of reasoning, however, was rejected in <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>...in favor of the balancing test set out above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McIver v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 52 MSPR 644, 650 (1992) (gross procedural error required a balance between the agency's excuse for committing the error and the prejudice or burden that the error caused the appellant; the appellant "failed to allege any burden or harm that any such errors caused him").</p>

SSA</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1088709.html">398 F.3d 1322</a> (Fed. Cir. 2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>), substantially rewrote the "gross procedural error" analysis to allow the agency to avoid paying fees, despite a statutory or constitutional due process violation, upon a determination that the agency reasonably believed that the underlying action was proper, and by a determination that the prejudice suffered by the appellant was no greater than other appellants bear in the course of any appeal leading to ultimate vindication on the merits. <span class="Italic">Price</span> was ambiguous as to the type of action that might involve severe prejudice to an appellant, and <span class="Italic">Price</span> left unclear whether the Board was deciding that gross procedural error occurs only when it can be <span id="Page_4595"></span>said, as to the underlying action, that the agency knew or should have known that it would lose the case, i.e., whether the "gross procedural error" test was subsumed by the "knew or should have known" test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial appeal, the administrative law judge determined that the agency had violated the appellant's statutory rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, as well as her constitutional right to due process, by constructively suspending her before the Board held a hearing or found good cause for her suspension. Additionally, that administrative law judge found that the agency had other alternatives to constructively suspending the appellant pending the adjudication of the issue of good cause for her suspension. <span class="Italic">(citing</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(b))]. Based on these findings, the administrative law judge in the attorney fees proceedings concluded that the agency committed a gross procedural error and engaged in a prohibited personnel practice by suspending the appellant without a hearing, and violated her right to due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that gross procedural error "is not simply 'harmful' procedural error such as suffices to require reversal of the agency action." <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435 n.36 (citations omitted). Rather, the inquiry into whether the agency committed gross procedural error "requires weighing the nature of and any excuse for the error against the prejudice and burden resulting for the employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, although the Board will not readjudicate the merits of the underlying appeal in determining whether fees should be awarded, it will consider the situation in which the agency found itself to determine whether it committed <span class="Italic">gross</span> procedural error<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 434 n.35, 435 n.36; <span class="Italic">see generally Akin v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 61, 63 n.4 (1985) (the Board should not reevaluate a presiding official's characterization of the evidence on the merits of the appeal, made in an initial decision which became final, upon review of a subsequent attorney fee request).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative law judge did not perform the appropriate balancing when he awarded the appellant attorney fees in this matter. Instead, he simply found that, because the agency erred by not seeking the Board's permission before suspending the appellant, fees were warranted in the interest of justice. That is precisely the type of analysis that <span class="Italic">Allen</span> rejected. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. at 428 (merely being a prevailing party does not establish that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the administrative law judge based his award of attorney fees in part on his finding that the agency had alternatives to placing the appellant in an AWOL status. Such alternatives are listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(b), which addresses an administrative law judge's status during removal proceedings in "exceptional cases" where her retention in her position "would be detrimental to the interests of the Government." The alternatives include assigning the appellant other duties which were not inconsistent with her normal duties, or placing her on paid administrative leave, with her consent. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(b)(1), (2). The administrative law judge found that the agency did not avail itself of these, or any of the other, regulatory alternatives, and concluded that the agency committed gross procedural error when it placed the appellant in AWOL status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency had not proposed the appellant's removal when it initially placed her in AWOL status. Therefore, the alternatives set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(b) were not applicable to the situation facing the agency when it instituted the appellant's AWOL status. The agency proposed the appellant's removal approximately 2 weeks after it placed her in AWOL status, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(b) applied in this case, the situation would have qualified as an exceptional one, since the appellant could not practice law and, therefore, could not perform the normal duties of her position, after her license was suspended. While the relevant statute and regulations do not expressly state that a law license is a requirement for an administrative law judge position, the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Factsheet states that applicants for administrative law judge positions "must be attorneys." Federal Employment Information Factsheet El-28, Administrative Law Judges. The Factsheet does not define the term "attorney," but the Board has held that a "GS-905 attorney must be licensed and authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a State, Territory, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and that while he is suspended, he does not meet this continuing requirement." <span class="Italic">McGean v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 49, 53-54 (1983). Thus, the agency argues that, because the appellant's law license had been suspended, one of the alternatives cited in the addendum initial decision--assignment to duties consistent with the appellant's normal position duties--was unavailable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.209(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, under the relevant statute and regulations, the appellant could not perform duties inconsistent with her position either. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105, administrative law judges "may not perform duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as administrative law judges." Furthermore, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.209(b) provides that an agency may not assign an administrative law judge to perform duties inconsistent with the duties of that position without OPM's prior approval, except in particular limited situations, e.g., the assignment is to last no more than 120 days. Thus, whether the agency could have assigned the appellant any duties after her law license was suspended is uncertain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency asserts that, in light of the situation caused by the appellant's actions, it had an acceptable and defensible excuse for taking the action it did, and that, at the time that it placed the appellant in AWOL status, it had not initiated removal proceedings against her. It claims that the appellant's conduct in a criminal matter resulted in the suspension of her license to practice law. Therefore, the agency concluded that, under the circumstances, the appellant was not ready, able and willing to perform the duties of her position. The agency also contends, as it did in the merits case, that it considered the relevant statute, regulations and case law which provide that an attorney who loses bar certification is not qualified to hold her position. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee</span> Federal Employment Information Factsheet El-28, Administrative Law Judges; <span class="Italic">McGean</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. at 53-54.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant caused her law license to be suspended. She could not practice law and could no longer carry out the duties of her administrative law judge position. The agency did not suddenly or thoughtlessly place the appellant in AWOL status. Further, even though the appellant could no longer act as an administrative law judge, the agency stopped short of removing her. Instead, it referred to the applicable statute, regulations and case law for guidance. Based on its research and analysis, the agency concluded that the appellant could not remain in her position because she no longer held a fundamental qualification to be an administrative law judge--a law license.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government has a significant interest in immediately suspending employees who occupy positions of great public trust and high public visibility when felony charges are filed against those employees. <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 932, 117 S. Ct. 1807, 1813, 138 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1997) (a state university's failure to provide a police officer with notice and an opportunity to be heard before suspending him without pay did not violate his due process rights where he had been arrested and charged with a felony). Under the circumstances, the agency could have reasonably believed that it was not violating the appellant's due process rights by placing her in AWOL status. <span class="Italic">See Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 487 U.S. 552, 569, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2552, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988) (when analyzing a request for attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, the Court recognized that it is possible for the government to take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose). This was not a case in which the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. Therefore, the agency's decision to place the appellant in AWOL status, although erroneous, was not without reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> test for gross procedural error, the agency's action has to be weighed against the prejudice and burden that resulted to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435 n.36. The appellant was taken out of pay status and had to file and prosecute a Board appeal because of that action. The appellant was subjected to a 3-month constructive suspension, which was supported by the appellant's criminal felony conviction and the suspension of her license to practice law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Mallen,</span> 486 U.S. 230, 240-43, 108 S. Ct. 1780, 1787-89, 100 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1988) (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation acted with sufficient promptness under the due process clause when it heard and decided the propriety of a suspension within 90 days of the suspension's inception when factors, such as a federal grand jury indictment, minimized the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the employee's property interest in continued employment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, there was some prejudice and burden to the appellant, but it was no more of a burden than that placed on anyone who seeks and is granted relief from the Board. If everyone who is placed under such a burden is entitled to attorney fees, the "interest of justice" standard would be meaningless. The Board's analysis must go beyond that to determine whether fees should be awarded. This is consistent with the finding of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that a presumption of attorney fees when an appellant prevails is contrary to the statutory intent of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) that awarding attorney fees "should not become...the ordinary practice in cases which the employee wins." <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-969 at 61, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2783 (1978)). We find that although the agency's action was erroneous, it did not rise to the level of gross procedural error. Accordingly, the appellant is not entitled to attorney fees on that basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Price v. SSA</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1088709.html">398 F.3d 1322</a>, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2005), affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Price's final argument is that SSA committed a "gross procedural error" under the fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. Under this factor, attorney fees are warranted if the agency commits a "gross procedural error" that "prolonged the proceeding" or "severely prejudiced" the employee. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.B. at 593. Ms. Price's argument under this factor is essentially an invitation for this court to overrule the existing case law requiring the Board to weigh both the gravity of the procedural error and the burden <span id="Page_4596"></span>placed on the petitioner. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (requiring the Board to weigh both the agency's error and the prejudice and burden inflicted on the petitioner); <span class="Italic">Swanson v. Def. Logistics Agency</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 115, 118 (1987) (same); <span class="Italic">accord Woodall v. FERC</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 127, 132 (1987). Ms. Price argues that the Board should not weigh the agency's procedural error with the prejudice and burden placed on the petitioner, but should consider only the agency's error. This court declines Ms. Price's invitation to rewrite the law governing the "gross procedural error" <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. The Board has broad discretion to consider the effect a procedural error has on the petitioner when analyzing whether an agency's error rises to the level of a "gross procedural error."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that SSA's procedural error was not a "gross procedural error." <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, slip op. at 7. SSA removed Ms. Price from paid status for merely three months. She recovered that lost pay, plus interest, through her petition filed with the Board. Thus, SSA's procedural error placed Ms. Price under "no more...burden than that placed on anyone who seeks and is granted relief from the Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Substantial evidence, therefore, supports the Board's finding that the SSA's procedural error was not "gross."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Price</span> was not cited in <span class="Italic">Kilpatrick v. VA</span>, CB-7121-13-0181-A-1 (NP 1/16/2015), awarding fees when an adverse action was reversed for lack of constitutional due process without an agency explanation for the error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our prior decision, the Board found that the deciding official considered a prior incident involving the appellant as part of her review of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, but the agency never referenced that it considered the incident in determining the appropriate penalty within its removal proposal. The agency did not provide the appellant with a constitutionally correct removal procedure even after he raised the due process issue both during the arbitration proceedings and before the Board. We found the prior incident to be new and material information. Based on this finding, we vacated the agency's disciplinary action and ordered the appellant reinstated until such time as the agency provided a constitutionally correct removal procedure. As a result, we now find that the agency provided no explanation for the serious procedural error and that the deciding official's consideration of the incident was highly prejudicial. Because the agency failed to provide the appellant with a constitutionally correct removal procedure, we conclude that the agency committed a gross procedural error and that fees are warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Price</span> was cited in <span class="Italic">Braxton v. VA</span>, DC-0752-14-0997-A-1 (NP 8/12/2022), denying fees to an appellant whose removal was set aside for a due process error involving failure properly to identify aggravating factors in a proposal notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the agency proved its charge of conduct unbecoming a supervisor, but nevertheless ordered the agency to reverse its action because he found that the deciding official violated the appellant's due process rights when she engaged in an ex parte communication. Specifically, the deciding official adopted the penalty analysis produced by the proposing official, which the administrative judge found was problematic because the analysis referenced aggravating factors not mentioned in the proposal, and the analysis was not shared with the appellant....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some circumstances, when an agency's action has been reversed on procedural due process grounds, the Board has awarded attorney fees pursuant to <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories 2 and 4. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mitchell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 103, 116 (1991) (finding an award of attorney fees warranted because a suspension was clearly without merit when the agency failed to provide any predecisional notice or opportunity to respond, and the action therefore could not have been sustained on appeal), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294 (2014); <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 127, 134 (1987) (finding an award of attorney fees warranted because the agency engaged in gross procedural error by suspending an employee without any predecisional notice or opportunity to respond). The Board also has awarded attorney fees pursuant to <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5 when an agency knew or should have known that its penalty would be mitigated, in part, because it improperly considered allegations of misconduct that were not included in the proposal notice in making its penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Brunning v. General Services Administration</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 490, 492-95 (1994).[5] However, the primary basis for the penalty mitigation in <span class="Italic">Brunning</span> was that the agency failed to prove many of its allegations against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Brunning</span>, the Board did not indicate that the agency's improper consideration of the appellant's past misconduct constituted a due process violation. <span class="Italic">Brunning</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 492-95. However, <span class="Italic">Brunning</span> was decided before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overruled the Board's holding that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications solely concerning penalty determinations did not constitute due process violations. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the facts of this case, in which the appellant prevailed solely on her due process claim, we find that the most relevant <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor to consider is whether the agency committed gross procedural error. The Board is not constrained to automatically find gross procedural error whenever an appellant obtains a reversal on procedural due process grounds. <span class="Italic">See Price v. Social Security Administration</span>, 398 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding that the Board is not deprived of its discretion over attorney fees in any case in which a due process hearing is improperly denied); <span class="Italic">cf. Wright v. Department of the Army</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 216, 218 (1981) (finding that an attorney fee award was not warranted in the interest of justice despite the agency's failure to apply the procedural requirements for effecting an adverse action). The Board will find gross procedural error only after weighing the nature of, and any excuse for, the error against the prejudice and burden resulting for the appellant. <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 413, &#x00B6; 17 (2010). If, in the balance, the prejudice and burden to the appellant predominates, gross procedural error exists, and the appellant is entitled to a fee award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nature of the error in this case, i.e., an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, is not one that requires a reversal in every case. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Instead, only those communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will undermine an appellant's due process rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, although the administrative judge ultimately concluded that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication at issue required a reversal, there is no indication that the conclusion that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights was not debatable among reasonable people. <span class="Italic">Cf. Price</span>, 398 F.3d at 1327 (finding that an attorney fees award was not warranted in the interest of justice when, among other things, the agency had some reasonable legal basis for denying the appellant certain due process rights); <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 11 (2005) (finding that, in the whistleblower context, for an agency action to constitute "gross" mismanagement, a conclusion that the agency erred cannot be debatable among reasonable people). The appellant has failed to demonstrate that she suffered any more prejudice or harm than is normally suffered by those who obtain relief from the Board. <span class="Italic">See Price</span>, 398 F.3d at 1327. Further, when the Board has found attorney fees warranted for due process errors in the past, those errors were such that the appellants were provided with little to no predecisional notice or opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mitchell</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 116; <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 115, 121-22 (1989); <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 134; <span class="Italic">Coltrane v. Department of the Army</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 6, 9 (1986). Here, by contrast, the agency gave the appellant substantial predecisional notice of the reasons for her demotion and an opportunity to respond but for the agency's failure to provide notice of the penalty-factor analysis that the proposing official provided to the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we will not disturb the determination of the administrative judge who decided in the underlying appeal that the appellant failed to establish that the particular procedural error at issue was so egregious as to constitute gross procedural error under the circumstances of this case. We also find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's determination that none of the other circumstances for awarding fees specified in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 434-35, are present here. The appellant has neither argued nor proven that she was substantially innocent of the charges or that the agency knew or should have known it would not prove its charges or lacked a valid basis for its action, and we find that attorney fees are not warranted on those bases. Additionally, for the reasons stated above, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the agency action was "clearly" taken without due process or that the agency "knew or should have known" that the action would be reversed on due process grounds. We find no evidence of any other circumstances in the existing record that would support an award of attorney fees in the interest of justice. Accordingly, we affirm the addendum initial decision denying the appellant's request for an award of attorney fees.</p>
