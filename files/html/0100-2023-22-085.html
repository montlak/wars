<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-86"><span class="space">a.</span> Administrative Law Judge Case</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">One circumstance provides a basis for the Board to award an EAJA fee: cases brought against administrative law judges, who may also claim fees under the Reform Act, 5 USC 7701(g). The Board explained the exception as well as the criteria governing an EAJA award in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Boyce</span>, 51 MSPR 295, 299-303 (1991), denying fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondents' initial petition for attorney fees was based on the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 5 USCA 504. The CALJ found as a matter of law that the EAJA was not applicable to proceedings before the Board. We conclude that the CALJ erred in this regard. For the reasons stated below, we hold that the EAJA may provide a basis for an award of attorney fees for services rendered before the Board in cases involving actions against administrative law judges under 5 USC 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EAJA has two parts: one involves fees awarded through judicial proceedings pursuant to 28 USC 2412, and the other, at issue here, involves an award of fees by an administrative agency pursuant to 5 USCA 504(a)(1) (1991). The standards for recovery under both statutes are the same.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to determine whether the EAJA applies to proceedings before an administrative agency, it is necessary to distinguish between "administrative proceedings" and "adversary adjudications." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 808 F.2d 1456, 1460 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Department of Commerce</span>, 735 F.2d 558, 562 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Only parties involved in an adversary adjudication before an <span id="Page_4615"></span>administrative agency may be awarded attorney fees under 5 USCA 504. That section provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An "adversary adjudication" is defined as an "adjudication under 554 of this title in which the position of the United States is represented by counsel or otherwise." 5 USCA 504(b)(1)(C). The position of the government agency in this proceeding was represented by an attorney. Consequently, this proceeding constituted an adversary adjudication as opposed to an administrative proceeding. However, an award of attorney fees may be outside the scope of the EAJA even when adversary adjudications are involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 554(a) of 5 USCA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This section applies, according to the provisions thereof, in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for agency hearing, except to the extent that there is involved:...(2) the selection or tenure of an employee, <span class="Italic">except a[n]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of this title</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposal to furlough the respondents was initiated under 5 USC 7521, which is applicable to ALJs appointed under 5 USC 3105. These employees are entitled to a hearing on the record before the Board when an agency initiates an action against them under section 7521. Thus, proceedings under section 7521 come within the scope of 5 USCA 554(a). Pursuant to this provision, an award of attorney fees would not be available under the EAJA in cases involving the tenure of non-ALJ employees. However, because this case involves ALJs appointed under section 3105 of title 5, the tenure provision does not exclude respondents' petition for fees from consideration under the EAJA.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In finding that the EAJA did not apply to Board proceedings, the CALJ relied on <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman</span>, 28 MSPR 120, 126 (1985), <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, 808 F.2d at 1461, and <span class="Italic">Olsen</span>, 735 F.2d at 562. We find that the CALJ's reliance on these decisions was misplaced. Although the Board's first attorney fee decision in <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, 28 MSPR at 125-26, found that the EAJA was inapplicable to Board proceedings, the Board subsequently reopened that appeal and expressly left that issue open. 33 MSPR at 326-27 n.1 (1987). Additionally, <span class="Italic">Gavette</span> and <span class="Italic">Olsen</span> did not involve employees who were ALJs, and the court's conclusion that 5 USCA 504 was inapplicable to the Board proceedings that involved those particular employee[s] did not resolve the question of whether section 504 is applicable to Board proceedings involving ALJs. <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, 808 F.2d at 1461, <span class="Italic">Olsen</span>, 735 F.2d at 562.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Prevailing Party Standard</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to whether the respondents are entitled to attorney fees in this particular case. The EAJA provides for an award of fees to the prevailing party unless the agency's position was substantially justified or special circumstances exist which make an award unjust. 5 USCA 504(a)(1). Thus, assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the respondents actually incurred fees (footnote omitted), the Board must find that they were the prevailing parties and that the action of the NLRB was not substantially justified in order to award fees under the EAJA. The respondents argue that they are the prevailing party in this matter on the grounds that the case was withdrawn unilaterally by the agency with no concessions from the respondents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the EAJA does not define the term "prevailing party" in matters other than eminent domain proceedings, the legislative history of the Act mandates that prior judicial interpretations of the term under other fee-shifting statutes should be applied. <span class="Italic">Austin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 742 F.2d 1417, 1419 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States</span>, 918 F.2d 164, 166 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 111 S. Ct. 1686 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that to be a "prevailing party" under 5 USCA 7701(g)(1), the relief obtained must be causally related to the MSPB proceeding. <span class="Italic">Cuthbertson v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 370, 373 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 MSPR 641 (1986) (to be deemed a prevailing party under section 7701(g)(1), the relief obtained must be causally related to the underlying litigation). We concur in the CALJ's finding in this proceeding that the withdrawal of the complaint in this matter was causally related to Congress' action of passing a new budget agreement. The agency initiated the withdrawal of the complaint less than three days after the budget agreement was passed. The withdrawal was not due in any part to the defense provided by the respondents or to any litigation pending before the Board. Therefore, we conclude that the respondents are not prevailing parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Substantial Justification Test</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the respondents were the prevailing parties, however, we must next decide whether the agency's action was substantially justified based on the administrative record. As the respondents correctly note, the burden is on the government to show that the agency's action was substantially justified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ellis v. United States</span>, 711 F.2d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Charter Management Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 768 F.2d 1299 (11th Cir. 1985) (at the administrative level, the burden is on the agency to establish that attorney fees should not be awarded under section 504(a)(1).) The CALJ did not analyze the "substantial justification" standard under the EAJA. The applicable statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USCA 504(a)(1). The question of when a government action is substantially justified has been addressed in many court cases involving awards of attorney fees under the EAJA for judicial proceedings pursuant to 5 USC 2412(d)(1)(A). Because the standards are the same under that section and 5 USCA 504(a)(1), we will apply this case law to our analysis of whether the government's action was substantially justified to preclude an award of attorney fees under the EAJA for proceedings before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gavette</span>, 808 F.2d at 1467, the Federal Circuit held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"[S]ubstantial justification" requires that the Government show that it was <span class="Italic">clearly</span> reasonable in asserting its position, including its position at the agency level, in view of the law and the facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court addressed the substantial justification standard in <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Underwood</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (1988), and held that it means "justified to the degree that could satisfy a reasonable person." The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that if the Government can demonstrate a reasonable basis in law and in fact for litigating the dispute, an award of attorney fees under the EAJA is precluded. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. United States</span>, 711 F.2d 1571, 1575-76 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to institute a furlough of an ALJ, an agency must show good cause before the Board after an opportunity for hearing on the record. 5 USC 7521. The agency filed the complaint in this matter seeking permission to institute a furlough under section 7521 in the face of potentially severe budget cuts. The agency was proposing to furlough all its administrative judges as well as most of its other employees. The furlough was proposed due to an anticipated budgetary shortfall if the sequestration provision of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act was enacted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Many other agencies anticipated similar budget cuts and also proposed to furlough agency employees, including their ALJs. The Board found in similar cases that compliance with a sequester order issued by the President pursuant to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act constituted good cause to furlough ALJs under section 7521. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Education v. Cook</span>, 46 MSPR 162 (1990); <span class="Italic">Federal Drug Administration v. Davidson</span>, 46 MSPR 223 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondents provided no evidence to even suggest that the agency was seeking to discipline its ALJs or was pursuing any improper purpose in seeking the furloughs. The fact that the complaint was withdrawn three days after Congress passed a new budget agreement similarly demonstrates that the budget situation was the sole motivating factor in the agency's initial furlough proposal. The facts of record here are more than adequate to support a conclusion that the government's action was clearly reasonable and, therefore, substantially justified. Therefore, we conclude that the agency has shown on the record that its action was substantially justified and that, accordingly, the respondents are not entitled to an award of attorney fees in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Alleged Procedural Errors and the Substantial Justification Test</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondents allege many procedural errors in the Board's processing of this matter. They argue that the expedited Board procedures were not reasonable and, consequently, that any Board order authorizing the furlough actions would not have been enforceable. Therefore, they contend, the proposed furlough actions were not substantially justified and they are entitled to attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the respondents' claims of alleged procedural error provide no basis for an award of attorney fees. The respondents' allegations regarding procedural errors were raised before the CALJ and the Board during the merits phase of this case. In response to the agency's motion to withdraw, the respondents argued that, based on the alleged procedural errors, the CALJ's previous recommended decisions should be vacated. The Board's final decision dismissing the case with prejudice based on the new budget agreement addressed these issues. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Beddow</span>, 47 MSPR at 105 and n.3 (1991). In the final decision, the Board considered these arguments but found that, because the previous decisions were of no precedential value, the respondents' concerns that these decisions would be cited as precedent were meritless. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 105. This decision was <span id="Page_4616"></span>final and the respondents were notified of their judicial review rights pursuant to the provisions of 5 USC 7703. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 106.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondents may not relitigate their claims of harmful procedural error in this attorney fee proceeding. It is well settled that a decision on a fee motion is an addendum to the decision on the merits and not a reconsideration of the evidence in a new light. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Additionally, the respondents' allegations in this regard are misplaced for another reason: it is the NLRB's proposed furlough action, not the Board's adjudication of that action, that must be shown to have been unjustified to entitle them to attorney fees. In any event, because the result would have been the same even if the Board had not relied on expedited procedures, the respondents have not shown any harmful adjudicatory error in this regard. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 283 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Goodman</span>, 28 MSPR 120, 124-25 (1985), referenced in <span class="Italic">Boyce,</span> stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided for the payment of attorney fees to a prevailing employee in an appeal to the Board....&#8197;This new benefit, which is available to other employees against whom adverse actions have been taken, is also available to administrative law judges. To find otherwise would be inconsistent with the enhanced protections which Congress has granted administrative law judges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Administrative law judges are employees of the federal government whom Congress intended to protect. They were given special protections that are not available to other employees. Because they can be subjected to the adverse actions of removal or suspension like other employees, they should have the same protections afforded other employees who can appeal to the Board. Therefore, administrative law judges should be able to obtain attorney fees when a proposed agency action is found to be unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Boyce</span> decision involved SSA's attempt to furlough judges as a result of a budget shortfall that was remedied during the litigation, meaning that the judges were not furloughed (that action requiring Board approval for ALJs) and the underlying cases were dismissed as moot. Under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> decided well after <span class="Italic">Boyce,</span> the disposition of the case would likely have precluded the judges from being prevailing parties under either the EAJA or Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1985 Goodman decision awarded fees under 5 USC 7701(g) and concluded that EAJA was not available for fee awards for MSPB litigation involving ALJs. The <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> decision was followed in <span class="Italic">SSA v. Balaban</span>, 33 MSPR 309, 313 (1987), to award fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g) to another ALJ. in <span class="Italic">SSA v. Goodman</span>, 33 MSPR 325, 327 n.12 (1987), the Board addressed the reasonableness of the amount of fees and touched upon an award of expenses, noting that the expenses claimed and denied under &#x00A7; 7701(g) would have been unavailable even if EAJA applied to the case. In its 1987 decision <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> decided that in cases under 5 USC 7521, involving actions against ALJs, counsel fee motions are handled through addendum initial decisions issued by the ALJ assigned to the case, reviewable through a PFR.</p>
