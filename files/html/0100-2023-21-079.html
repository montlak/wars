<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-79"><span id="Page_4193"></span><span class="space">19.</span> Earnings Recovery</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 8337(d) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, recovers from his disability, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 1 year after the date of the medical examination showing the recovery, whichever is earlier. If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier versions of 5 USC 8337 led to varying results, depending on the language then in effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Each disability annuitant under age 60 must report to OPM annual income from wages and self-employment. Depending on their level, earnings may cut off retirement benefits if the annuitant's earnings capability has been restored under 5 CFR 831.1209 (2022) (CSRS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Termination of disability annuity because of restoration to earning capacity</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Restoration to earning capacity.</span> If a disability annuitant is under age 60 on December 31 of any calendar year and his or her income from wages or self-employment or both during that calendar year equal at least 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement, the annuitant's earning capacity is considered to be restored. The disability annuity will terminate on the June 30 after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 844.401-02 (FERS) (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hoffler v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 692, 693 n.1 (1988), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(d) provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that, if an annuitant receiving disability retirement from the Fund, before become sixty years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay for the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or one year after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier. The law further provides that earning capacity is deemed restored if in each of two succeeding calendar years the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least eighty percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement. An amendment to the law, Public Law 97-253, provides that, with respect to income earned after December 31, 1982, earnings from any calendar year, rather than two, will be used to determine if the annuitant made more than eighty percent of the correct rate, and that if he has, disability annuity will be terminated 180 days after the end of that calendar year, rather than one year later.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a FERS annuity, <span class="Italic">Burton v. OPM,</span> CH-0841-14-0691-I-1 (NP 7/14/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8455(a)(2), the annuity of a FERS disability annuitant who is restored to earning capacity before becoming 60 years of age terminates upon reemployment by the federal government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is restored, whichever is earlier. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.402(a). Earning capacity is deemed restored if, in any calendar year, the annuitant's income from wages and/or self-employment equals at least 80% of the current rate of basic pay of the position he occupied immediately before retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8455(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.402(b). OPM will reinstate a disability annuity terminated because earning capacity was restored when the disability annuitant again loses earning capacity, as determined by OPM. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.404(c)(1)(iii). The reinstated annuity is payable from January 1 of the year following the calendar year in which earning capacity was lost. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.404(c)(2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">While a FERS disability annuitant is also receiving a social security disability annuity, his FERS disability annuity must be reduced by the social security disability amount to which he is entitled, as determined by the Social Security Administration, because such amount represents an assumed social security disability amount used in computing the FERS annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8452(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Maxwell v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In his petition for review, the appellant states that, during 2014, he earned less than 80% of the base pay of his former position, and that he has requested OPM to reinstate his FERS disability annuity on that basis. However, the Board cannot review this claim until either OPM issues a final decision on the matter or OPM refuses or improperly fails to issue a final decision. 5.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered constitutionally adequate the process of discontinuing a disability annuity upon OPM's determination of restoration of earning capacity, following notice to the annuitant and an opportunity to respond, subject to Board appeal, <span class="Italic">May v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 534, 538-40 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant also challenges the administrative judge's finding that she could not review his allegation that OPM denied his procedural due process because the Board lacks authority to determine the constitutionality of federal statutes. Although the Board is without authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes, <span class="Italic">Malone v. Department of Justice</span>, 14 MSPR 403, 406 (1983), the Board has the authority to adjudicate a constitutional challenge to an agency's application of a statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> K. Davis, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law Treatise</span> &#x00A7; 20.04, 74 (1958). Thus, the Board will decide whether the agency's action in this case, terminating the appellant's annuity before he received notice of being deemed restored to earning capacity, is consistent with fundamental concepts of due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Benefits that are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them may not be terminated without affording the recipient procedural due process. <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Kelly,</span> 397 U.S. 254 (1970). The essence of this due process is the requirement that the person in jeopardy of serious loss be given notice of the case against him and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Matthews v. Eldridge,</span> 424 U.S. 319 (1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, due process requires the opportunity to submit, at a minimum, a written response to the notice prior to deprivation of a significant property interest. There are, however, some situations in which a post-deprivation opportunity to respond will satisfy due process requirements. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1493 n.7 (1985). A claim to a pre-deprivation opportunity to respond as a matter of constitutional right rests on the proposition that full relief cannot be obtained at a post-deprivation hearing. <span class="Italic">Matthews</span> at 331.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that ultimately the appellant received a post-deprivation opportunity to respond to OPM's notice of the termination of his disability retirement annuity. The question is whether his post-deprivation hearing satisfied the requirements of due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated June 12, 1986, OPM attempted to give the appellant pre-termination notice that his annuity would cease on June 30 and that his attendant benefit of group hospital insurance rates would also cease on that date, but that he could convert to another hospitalization insurance plan within 30 days, maintaining his insurance coverage during that interval. In that letter, OPM also informed the appellant of his opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant avers that the June 12, 1986 notice did not reach him. In late June 1986, the appellant changed his residence. He informed OPM of his new address by letter of July 5, 1986. OPM succeeded in notifying him of the termination of his benefits on July 22, 1986, slightly more than three weeks after the annuity ceased, but about 8 days before the termination and expiration of conversion rights of the associated benefit of group hospital insurance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because nothing in the record controverts the appellant's assertion that he did not receive OPM's June 12 notice and the appellant quickly responded to OPM's July 22 notice, filing a request for reconsideration on July 25, 1986, the Board finds that the appellant did not receive pre-termination notice with respect to the cessation of his annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, however, that under the unique circumstances of this case, the appellant's post-deprivation hearing satisfies the requirements of due process. OPM attempted to afford the appellant pre-termination due process and the post-termination process could provide complete relief. <span class="Italic">See Curlott v. Campbell,</span> 598 F.2d 1175, 1181 (9th Cir. 1979). Further, the post-termination process was swift. OPM responded to the appellant's request for reconsideration on September 19, 1986, less than three months after payment of the annuity ceased.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the risk is small that, because he received a post-deprivation, rather than a pre-deprivation, hearing, the appellant might be deprived of the means by which he lived. The decision to terminate benefits was based on the statement of annual earning capacity prepared by the appellant <span id="Page_4194"></span>himself. Further, the risk that the appellant would be without hospital insurance was reduced because the appellant received notice while he still had time to exercise conversion rights to assure that his insurance coverage would continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The earnings limitations are not discretionary; they cannot be waived, <span class="Italic">Burton v. OPM</span>, 641 Fed. Appx. 970, 971-72 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The income limitations for a disability retirement annuity are governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8455 and are not discretionary. It is undisputed that Mr. Burton's income exceeded the statutory threshold from 2011 to 2013. For example, in 2013 the threshold for Mr. Burton was $44,418.40, which is 80% of the salary for the permanent position from which he retired. In 2013, Mr. Burton earned $47,910, or $3,491.60 more than the statutory threshold. Mr. Burton points to no authority giving him a right to annuity payments notwithstanding the fact that he earned more than the statutory threshold amount set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8455(a)(2). This court has consistently held that section 8455 does not provide for exceptions or waivers in its application. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Daniel v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 469 Fed. Appx. 850 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 427 Fed. Appx. 878 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Daniel v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 245 Fed. Appx. 969 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8455 required the termination of Mr. Burton's annuity once his income exceeded the threshold amount. OPM is not empowered to disregard such statutory directives for calculating disability annuity payments. <span class="Italic">See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 430 (1990) ("[i]t would be most anomalous for a judicial order to require a Government official, such as the officers of OPM, to make an extrastatutory payment of federal funds."). The prohibition against making unauthorized disability payments contrasts with the authorization granted in other statutes, such as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b), which provides that OPM will not seek recovery of overpayments from an individual when, in the agency's judgment, the individual "is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Burton argues that he would not have been compelled to earn more than the statutory threshold amount if OPM had not improperly continued to reduce his disability annuity after his social security benefits had been terminated, that argument provides no ground for overriding the statutory prohibition on disability benefits to persons who earn more than the statutory threshold amount. Because Mr. Burton was not entitled to payment of a disability annuity during the period that his earnings exceeded the statutory earnings limitation, the Board correctly denied his request for a monetary award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a reemployed annuitant and restoration of earnings capacity, <span class="Italic">Blunk v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 267, 271-72 (1987) (Member Devaney dissenting), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8344 (a) clearly requires that an amount equal to the retirement annuity allocable to the period of employment of a reemployed annuitant be deducted from his pay. Under Section 8344(a), a disability retiree who is reemployed by an agency receives through annuity and net salary combined the full salary of the position in which he is reemployed. When a determination of recovery of earning capacity is made, the retirement annuity ceases, but so does the deduction from pay under Section 8344(a); thus, the employee continues to receive the full salary of the position. Therefore, logic requires us to conclude that a disability annuitant's earning capacity a reemployed annuitant is equal to the gross wages or salary of the position in which he is reemployed. Finally, this interpretation is consistent with the obvious objective of Section 8337(d) of removing from the disability rolls those annuitants who have demonstrated the capacity to earn an income "fairly comparable to the current rate of the position" from which they retired. That objective is carried out by focusing on the reemployed annuitants earning capacity as reflected by the gross income attributed to the position. Again, the "double dipping" deduction ceases upon termination of the annuity and is thus irrelevant to the determination of earning capacity.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;OPM's codification of its administrative interpretation of Sections 8337(d) and 8344(a), at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a), comports with the Board's interpretation of those statutes. OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502 (a) provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">'[i]ncome from wages and/or self-employment' means money or property received by a disability annuitant as consideration for or in reward of personal services or a work product...and also includes, for a disability annuitant reemployed by the Federal Government, any amount offset or deducted under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8344....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this interpretation to the present case, the Board holds that the amount of the appellant's federal wages that were deducted from his earnings under the provisions of Section 8344(a) must be included in his income for purposes of determining whether he was restored to earning capacity under Section 8337(d). With the inclusion of the amount of the appellant's wages that were deducted from his 1983 federal employment earnings under Section 8344(a), his income was greater than eighty percent of the current rate of pay of the position he occupied immediately before retirement. Thus, the appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that he has not been restored to earning capacity under Section 8337 (d). <span class="Italic">See Cradduck v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 432, 434 (1986); <span class="Italic">Lancelotti v.

OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 385, 388 &#x00B6; 6 (2000) ("On petition for review, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in failing to consider the higher cost of living in California, where he now resides, compared to Panama, where he worked. However, neither the statute nor OPM's implementing regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart L, provides that an annuitant's income or the current rate of pay for his former position should be adjusted to account for differences in the cost of living in various locations.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a disability annuity is terminated because of restoration of earnings capacity, a claim for a survivor annuity may be defeated if, prior to the restoration of the annuity, the former employee dies and does not have the status of an annuitant at the time of death.
