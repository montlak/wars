<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Desiderio v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 84, 86, 4 MSPB 171 (1980), "authorization of leave without pay is a matter of administrative discretion. Employees cannot demand that they be granted leave without pay as a matter of right. FPM Supplement 990-2, 630-55, Subchapter S12-2, May 19, 1969." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lawson v. GPO</span>, 8 MSPR 478, 480 (1981) ("[E]mployees have no right to leave without pay upon demand."). However, "[w]here there is a medical excuse, the Board will examine the record as a whole to determine whether the agency's denial of LWOP to an employee charged with AWOL was reasonable under the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Bologna v. DOD</span>, 73 MSPR 110, 113 (1997). Although the denial of LWOP must be reasonable, the agency acts reasonably in denying the leave "even in the face of medical evidence showing that the employee is unable to work if there is no foreseeable end in sight to the employee's absence and the absence is a burden to the agency." <span class="Italic">Young v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 187, 193-94 &#x00B6; 14 (1999) (respiratory therapy department could not be run with one employee continually absent; removal of the appellant was necessary so that the appellant's position could be filled).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee lacks sufficient sick leave, the agency has the discretion of granting leave without pay or charging the employee AWOL, regardless of whether the employee has presented administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity. <span class="Italic">Riley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 683, 689 n.4 (1992), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Carr v. DOD</span>, 61 MSPR 172, 176 (1994); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 483, 484 (1984) (question of granting LWOP to an employee was "totally within the agency's discretion"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Benavidez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 241 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("Placing an employee on leave without pay is a temporary measure designed to cover an interim situation pending final resolution."). Assuming that there is no LWOP requested and granted under the Family Medical Leave Act, ordinarily there is no right to LWOP in place of AWOL. <span class="Italic">Conner v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 131, 133, 5 MSPB 194 (1981) ("Appellant had no right to have his unapproved absences charged to leave without pay. The authorization of leave without pay is a matter of administrative discretion. The agency was <span id="Page_2457"></span>acting within the bounds of discretion and authority when it denied appellant leave without pay for his absences. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Desiderio v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPB 171, 172 (1980)."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Roby v. DOJ</span>, 59 MSPR 426, 429 (1993) (declining to accept the argument that an employee should not have been charged with AWOL because he had enough annual leave to cover the absence: "Whether the appellant had enough annual leave is irrelevant to the question of whether the agency abused its discretion in denying his request for leave. An employee must request approval to take leave; he cannot simply demand it."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hill v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-16-0744-I-2 (NP 2/21/2023) ("An appellant cannot assume that an agency has approved leave in the absence of any notification on a leave request; to do so would be inconsistent with the appellant's responsibility for requesting leave and keeping the agency informed about her availability for work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. General Services Administration</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 630, 634, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 944 F.2d 913 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).").

<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the agency recorded the appellant as AWOL, it approved the appellant's use of leave, advanced leave, donated leave and 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). After more than a year of absence, the agency informed the appellant, by letter dated August 6, 2009, that because the agency had "not received the required additional [medical] documentation," and neither the appellant nor her representative had "communicated to [management] when [the appellant] plan[ned] to return to work[,] " the agency intended to begin to record the appellant's absences as AWOL beginning August 31, 2009. The appellant was warned "that AWOL may serve as the basis for disciplinary action up to and including removal from Federal service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review, as she did below, that the agency's Administrative Instruction (AI) No. 67 created a requirement that the agency authorize LWOP. However, AI No. 67 specifically states that "LWOP is subject to the approval of the [agency] official" except for a few situations in which the granting of LWOP is mandatory. The appellant's situation does not fall under any of the situations in which the granting of LWOP is mandated.[2] The policy does authorize officials to approve LWOP in a number of circumstances, including for a period of ill health or while an Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) claim is pending. However, the policy does not <span class="Italic">mandate</span> LWOP for these situations; it indicates that an official is authorized to exercise his or her discretion for such situations. Under the appellant's particular circumstances, the agency's decision not to authorize further LWOP was consistent with its policy. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Bologna,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 114.[3]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that "[a]n adverse action based on AWOL cannot be sustained when there is an Office of Worker's Compensation claim pending[,]" and cites <span class="Italic">Brown v. National Archives &#x0026; Records Administration</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 95 (2002) in support of this position. This assertion reflects a misunderstanding of the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>. In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Board held that an adverse action based on AWOL cannot be sustained if OWCP determines that the individual was entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire time period charged as AWOL. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 95, &#x00B6; 6.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave. <span class="Italic">See Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148 (2002). However, the Board has held that an agency may bring an adverse action against an employee for excessive approved absences if the following criteria have been met: (1) The employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that the agency's approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Gartner v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 9 (2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984)). Furthermore, in determining that removal based on an employee's incapacitation from duty promotes the efficiency of the service, the Board has found that "an absence for which no foreseeable end is in sight constitutes a burden which no employer can efficiently endure." <span class="Italic">Ward v. General Services Administration</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 207, 209 (1985); <span class="Italic">see also Edwards v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 17 (2008) (when an employee has been removed for unavailability for duty because of incapacitation, the Board relies on the absence of a foreseeable end to the unavailability).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge failed to analyze whether the agency satisfied the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criteria to prove the charge of excessive approved absences. Instead, she sustained the charge because it was undisputed that the appellant had not worked for a period of more than a year. Nevertheless, the undisputed record shows that the agency met the <span id="Page_2458"></span><span class="Italic">Cook</span> criteria because the appellant had been absent for compelling reasons beyond her control for more than a year, and the appellant's own medical documentation established that she could not perform the essential functions of her position, that she was unable to return to duty, and that her absence had no foreseeable end. Additionally, the agency clearly notified the appellant in a return to work letter on November 20, 2009, that she held a key position and that her continued absence from work would leave the agency no choice but to take a removal action in order to insure that its operational needs were met. Thus, the record shows that the agency proved all of the factors required by <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> that the appellant's removal promoted the efficiency of the service, and that removal was a reasonable penalty under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the undisputed facts in this appeal do not support the appellant's contention that the agency's removal action should have been analyzed as a type of enforced leave under <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>. The Board has recognized that two general situations give rise to enforced leave/constructive suspension claims. The first situation is when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an "inquiry" into her ability to perform. In such a case, the issue is whether the agency or the employee initiated an absence lasting more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 5 (2000); <span class="Italic">McIver-Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 464, 467 (1997). The second situation is when an employee is absent from work for medical reasons and requests to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies that request, even though it is obligated to offer the employee available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">See Hardy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 539, &#x00B6; 12 (2003); <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 692 (1996). There is no suggestion in this appeal that the appellant's absences were affected by either of these situations. In fact, the appellant has acknowledged that she left work because of work place injury and that she remains unable to return to work; therefore, the appellant has failed to meet her burden to show harmful error in this claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's claim that the agency was not authorized to remove her based on absence during a period for which she was receiving FECA benefits, it is true that the Board has long recognized that an adverse action based on an AWOL charge cannot be sustained if OWCP determines that the employee was entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire time period charged as AWOL. <span class="Italic">See Sambrano v. Department of Defense,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 449, &#x00B6; 7 (2011); <span class="Italic">Brown v.

However, the Board has never held that an agency is, therefore, prohibited from implementing an adverse action predicated upon leave-related charges <span id="Page_2459"></span>pending a final determination from OWCP. <span class="Italic">Sambrano</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 449, &#x00B6; 7. Rather, we have said that it does so at the risk of having the action overturned if OWCP subsequently finds that the employee was entitled to compensation for the absent period, requiring the employee's retroactive placement in a leave without pay (LWOP) status and the invalidation of the AWOL charge. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Hardin v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 42, 45 (1983).[2] Moreover, we have also recognized that an agency may discipline an employee for failure to follow leave procedures even when a related AWOL charge is invalidated as a result of OWCP's finding. <span class="Italic">Hardin,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. at 45; <span class="Italic">cf. Somuk v. Department of the Navy,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 8 (2009) (agency may bring charge of failure to follow leave procedures during period that appellant was on approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) but must show that it did not thereby interfere with his rights under the FMLA.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We also note that under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), an employee absent because of a compensable injury may be carried on leave without pay or <span class="Italic">separated</span> unless the employee elects to use sick and annual leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(b) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, and most significantly for resolution of this appeal, we long ago acknowledged that an agency need not carry an employee receiving workers' compensation benefits on its employment rolls indefinitely. <span class="Italic">Stith</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. at 331 n.3. In reaffirming that principle today, we recognize that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1),[3] a compensably injured employee[4] who fully recovers within one year after the date of commencement of compensation has an unconditional right to return to his former or equivalent position. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a). The plain language of this statutory provision clearly evidences congressional intent to ensure job security for one year to compensably injured employees. Therefore, terminating such an individual's federal employment based on leave use during this statutory one-year period would be inappropriate insofar as it would effectively deprive the individual of this statutory right to job restoration. <span class="Italic">See McCauley v. Department of the Interior</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 11 (2011) (because the FMLA unambiguously promises job security to employees who take FMLA leave, use of such leave as grounds for removal is "inappropriate"); <span class="Italic">Gross v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 83, 90 (1997) ("If an agency bases an adverse action on its interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, the adverse action is a violation of law and cannot be sustained."); <span class="Italic">see also Hardin</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. at 45 (an agency should normally carry compensably injured employees in a LWOP status for the one-year period because employees who fully recover within that period have a right to immediate and unconditional restoration to their prior position or an equivalent one).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This provision is part of FECA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, which is a comprehensive statutory scheme providing federal and postal employees who are injured in the performance of their duties, including those who suffer from occupational disease, with workers' compensation benefits, including wage and medical benefits, as well as with rights to job restoration under certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;A "compensably injured individual" refers to a federal or postal employee who incurs an injury in the performance of his duties which is covered under FECA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, Congress did not provide job security to compensably injured employees who do <span class="Italic">not</span> fully recover within the statutory one-year time frame. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b)-(d). Consequently, an action to remove a compensably injured employee after expiration of the statutory one-year period based on excessive absence does not run afoul of the unconditional right to restoration under FECA. In the instant appeal, the appellant admitted that she had not worked since January 8, 2009. Thus, when the agency effected the appellant's removal on May 29, 2010, she had been absent from the work for over 16 months. Because the record reflects that the one-year period of time during which the appellant arguably would have been entitled to return to her position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) had expired by the effective date of appellant's removal, we find that the agency did not commit harmful error in bringing this removal action.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the record shows that the agency considered the appellant's extended absence from work, his failure to submit adequate documentation to substantiate his absence for a period of six months, and his failure to report for investigative interviews to be serious acts of misconduct under the first charge of unsatisfactory performance. Indeed, the decision letter states that each charge alone would have warranted the appellant's removal. Therefore, the subsequent invalidation of the second charge of AWOL did not establish that the agency lacked reasonable grounds for proposing the removal or that the agency knew or should have known that the reasons for the removal could not be substantiated. Furthermore, after considering the totality of the circumstances, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of his retirement because he had no realistic alternative but to retire, or that his retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. Instead, this is a case where the appellant voluntarily retired when faced with the unpleasant choice of retiring or opposing a removal action.

In addition, although the Board in <span class="Italic">Stevens</span> did note that attending work regularly was an essential function of almost every government job, our holding in that case was, in fact, limited to finding that a request for accommodation was unreasonable where the appellant sought to be excused from following the agency's leave-granting procedures. <span class="Italic">Stevens,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 625, 628. For these reasons, we find that the administrative judge erred in not allowing the appellant the opportunity to develop the record as to whether his request for LWOP was a request for reasonable accommodation and whether granting such a request would have posed an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the record shows that the administrative judge cut off the appellant's presentation of evidence regarding whether his request for three months additional LWOP truly constituted an undue hardship on the agency and whether the agency had provided more favorable treatment to similarly situated employees who were absent for lengthy periods of time. She further prevented the appellant from obtaining evidence from the deciding official as to whether he understood and properly followed agency procedures for responding to the appellant's request for a reasonable accommodation, including the agency's requirement to forward the determination of undue hardship to higher management. As a result of these evidentiary limitations, we do not have a complete record upon which to conclude whether the appellant's request for LWOP was a reasonable accommodation or whether the agency met its burden of proving the defense of undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, it appears that the agency was obligated under the circumstances to engage in an interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found in a case where an injured employee requested the opportunity to return to work part-time:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The duty to make reasonable accommodations does not, of course, require an employer to hold an injured employee's position open indefinitely while the employee attempts to recover, nor does it force an employer to investigate every aspect of an employee's condition before terminating him based on his inability to work. At the very least, however, an employee who proposes an accommodation while still on short-term leave-as Parker did here, at least two weeks prior to his termination-triggers a responsibility on the employer's part to investigate that request and determine its feasibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Parker v. Columbia Pictures Industries,</span> 204 F.3d 326, 338 (2d Cir. 2000). In this case, the appellant has shown that he sufficiently responded to the agency's requests for additional medical information, and that he made a specific request for a reasonable accommodation that triggered the obligation for the agency to engage in the interactive process. Thus, the issue has been raised whether the appellant presented sufficient evidence to show that if the agency had engaged in the interactive process, the parties may have identified an alternative reasonable accommodation for the appellant of returning to work part-time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even though leave without pay is a matter of administrative discretion, the agency should consider whether the serious needs of the employee offset the costs and inconvenience to the government of maintaining the employee in LWOP status. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 9 MSPR 59, 61 (1981); <span class="Italic">McDuffie v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 360, 363, 6 MSPB 307 (1981) (under FPM guidance, the agency should consider "whether the serious needs of the employee offset the costs and inconveniences to the Government in retaining an employee in a LWOP status" "[h]aving denied appellant's request for LWOP, the agency charged him with AWOL as appellant had exhausted both his annual and sick leave"). Factors for an agency to consider when granting or denying a LWOP request include whether the employee's services can be spared and whether the reasons for requesting LWOP are legitimate. <span class="Italic">Webb v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 536, 542 (1982) (modified or overruled by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011) (as to an excessive absence charge: "because the efficiency of the service may suffer in the absence of an employee's services, regardless of the type of leave used, we hold that whether the leave is sick leave, annual leave, LWOP, or AWOL will not be dispositive to a charge of excessive absences").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To support the denial of LWOP, the agency may show that the appellant's absence created a burden on the agency and that the absence was prolonged or had no foreseeable end. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 154, 159 (1993) ("Where an employee who is incapacitated for duty has exhausted all of his/her leave, it is not improper to deny LWOP where there is no foreseeable end in sight to the employee's absence and the appellant's absence is a burden to the agency."); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 615, 617-18 (1986) (citing <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 44, 45-46 (1984) (discontinuation of LWOP for an employee with a disability retirement application pending was an abuse of discretion; the employee's duties had been reassigned and LWOP was no burden to the employer)); <span class="Italic">Kamer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 184, 187, 6 MSPB 163 (1981) (employee was properly denied LWOP and removed for AWOL when he was unable to report for duty due to illness or injury, his absence continued for more than two years, and he was warned that because of the difficulties caused by his absence adverse action would be taken if he did not return to work); <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 496, 497, 1 MSPB 480 (1980) (employee was removed, following a warning concerning the need to return to work, after more than two years of LWOP resulting from illness or injury: "Employee absence for which no foreseeable end is in sight is a burden which no employer can efficiently endure.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 260, 263-64 (1989), reversed a removal based on AWOL after the Board determined that LWOP should have been granted. The Board considered the "record as a whole to determine whether the agency's denial of LWOP was reasonable under the circumstances." The agency did not prove through evidence of employees' opinions that employee morale would suffer if the appellant received LWOP, and agency officials did not consider whether the appellant could be spared from his job. In fact, they did not know what he was actually doing or capable of doing when deciding to remove him. The appellant's absence was caused by a work-related injury, and his financial distress made it difficult for him to provide the agency with some medical documentation. The agency did not show that the appellant's intermittent absences created an undue burden on operations or that the absences would probably continue without a foreseeable end. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 109 MSPR 579, 2008 MSPB 197 (2008) (following review by EEOC, <span class="Italic">Edwards v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-16-0376-I-1 (NP 7/22/2022) (tardiness: "We find that the administrative judge properly found that the supervisor abused his discretion in automatically carrying the appellant in an AWOL status without weighing other factors that might have warranted a grant of leave without pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 17 (2003) (stating that, even when the employee lacks sufficient leave to cover his absences, an AWOL charge based on those absences cannot be sustained if the agency abused its discretion in denying the employee's request for leave without pay); <span class="Italic">Murray v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 260, 263-65 (1989) (finding an abuse of discretion when an agency denied leave without pay for 69 hours of absence for which the employee did not have sufficient sick and annual leave because the <span id="Page_2461"></span>agency knew that his absence stemmed from an on-the-job injury).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When considering a request for LWOP for illness, the agency should examine whether the serious needs of the employee offset the costs and inconvenience to the agency in retaining the employee in a LWOP status. The agency may properly deny the leave if it has adequately supported claims of workload and backlog problems. <span class="Italic">Lehnerd v. OPM</span>, 27 MSPR 525, 528 (1985). An agency properly denies continuing LWOP if an employee has been absent due to illness or injury for six months and there is no foreseeable end to the absence. Indefinite absence is a burden that no employer can efficiently endure and serves as just cause for dismissal. <span class="Italic">Holt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 448, 450, 5 MSPB 453 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lattanzi v. DHHS</span>, 12 MSPR 307, 308 (1982) (appellant was removed after she received LWOP for a year; OWCP stated that she could return to work at 20 hours a week, and the appellant informed the agency that she would not return to work in any position); <span class="Italic">Cox v. ITC</span>, 12 MSPR 297, 299-300 (1982) (removal following 16 months of LWOP; removal was reversed when, as a result of a job-related injury, the expected period of continued disability was but six to eight weeks (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Agnes v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 176 (1980))).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant cannot be spared from his assigned duties, the agency need not grant LWOP. <span class="Italic">Haine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 462, 470 (1989); <span class="Italic">Hart v. GSA</span>, 31 MSPR 664, 665 (1986) ("we find the record supports the administrative judge's conclusions that the agency required appellant's services and the agency's decision to deny appellant LWOP was not an abuse of discretion"). The agency may also consider the timeliness of the appellant's medical documentation, the strength of the evidence of the claimed debilitating condition, the degree of cooperation with the agency's efforts to clarify the appellant's leave status, and the need for the appellant at the work site. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robb v. DOD</span>, 77 MSPR 130, 137 (1997) ("Given the lack of documentation, the agency, acting within its discretion regarding LWOP...properly considered him to be AWOL...."); <span class="Italic">Fisher v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 675, 679-80 (1992) (explaining <span class="Italic">Murray)</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board examination focuses on matters as they stood at the time of the LWOP request. <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 631, 636 (1987), discerned no good reason for the agency to deny the LWOP request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying these facts and circumstances, we consider them when the LWOP request is made. As our decisions cited above illustrate, we balance the agency's work load requirements with the legitimacy of the LWOP request, considering the applicant's record of prior abuse of leave or the potential for such abuse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency made no claim or showing that the appellant's presence on any of the three dates in question was functionally necessary even to the normal operation of her branch. In addition, there is no evidence that the agency's work load performance suffered during the appellant's earlier three-month absence. The agency itself verified the legitimacy of the LWOP requests for April 23th and 28th by independently contacting the Compensation Coordinator before placing her on AWOL status. Thus, there can be no question about the legitimacy of the appellant's need to be on leave for some period of time on these two dates. The agency also failed to offer any evidence of time and attendance abuse by the appellant or any persuasive rationale that granting her request would create a real risk of potential abuse by the appellant or others. On this record, then, we find that the agency's denial of LWOP for April 23rd and 28th was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The denial or discontinuance of LWOP is proper if an agency has counseled, reprimanded, and suspended the appellant for past leave abuse and notified her that it will no longer continue to grant her LWOP. <span class="Italic">Wells v. DHHS</span>, 29 MSPR 346, 348 (1985). Before removing an employee on LWOP, the agency should advise her to report to work or face dismissal. Additionally, the agency should show that the position needs to be filled by an employee available on a regular basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Komora v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 181, 182 (1982). The agency need not formally deny LWOP when the agency charges an employee with AWOL and the record is sufficient to show that denial of LWOP is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 25, 39 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is not a defense to an AWOL charge that the employee requested LWOP. The agency may decline to continue an employee in LWOP status if the employee's absence, caused by incarceration, will continue over many months. The agency is then justified in removing the employee for AWOL. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 408, 411-12 (1983). Continuing LWOP may not be assumed after one period of LWOP is approved and comes to an end. The appellant should request leave and keep the agency informed of his ability to work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. GSA</span>, 46 MSPR 630, 634 (1991), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Scorcia v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 588, 591 (1998) (interpreting <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> to mean that "the agency's action of temporarily carrying the employee in LWOP status, despite its decision to deny his request for LWOP, did not preclude the agency from ultimately determining that the employee's proper leave status for the period in question should be AWOL") (<span class="Italic">Scorcia</span> was overruled on other grounds by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011)). Although the agency may grant the employee LWOP once, it need not do so again if its program requirements change, nor is the employee free to determine for himself when the agency must grant the LWOP. <span class="Italic">Barrash v. Bowen</span>, 846 F.2d 927, 930-31 (4th Cir. 1988), reviewing dismissal of an SSA employee absent for maternity reasons in violation of the agency's directives to return to work, observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the applicable rules and regulations, management had the discretionary authority to grant leave without pay and to determine its duration. Better employees, just as the worst, may not dictate the exercise of that discretionary, managerial function. Bedlam would ensue if the better employees were permitted to determine for themselves whether or not they should be granted leave without pay, and the duration of any such leave. Permitting one of the better employees to do so could create serious morale problems for all of the other employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will consider an argument that an employee should not be fired for AWOL, after being denied LWOP, because sick leave might have been available to him had he requested sick leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 436, 438-40 (1987) (accrued sick leave would not have covered the period of absence and that there are cases suggesting contrary results under some circumstances; factors the agency could consider, consistent with its guidelines, were the employee's past leave and disciplinary record, the employee's willingness to take advantage of any necessary rehabilitative counseling or treatment, and the likelihood of the employee's return at the end of the LWOP period); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Joyner v.

The granting of annual leave is, however, within the discretion of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 6302(d)"; noting that if annual leave had been substituted, the employee would still have remained with a substantial period of AWOL).
