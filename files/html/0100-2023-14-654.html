<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-655"><span class="space">F.</span> DEFINITION OF WORK ERRORS AND PRODUCTIVITY</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA generally decides that proposals eliminating a specific component from the performance appraisal process directly interfere with management's right to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 28 FLRA 871, 875 (1987) (proposal that student test results not be used to evaluate employees); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and DOD, DCAA Central Region</span>, 57 FLRA 172, 176-78 (2001) (Proposal 8: union could not compel negotiation of proposal that employee's rating would be unaffected by that employee's decision not to use agency electronic paperwork processing system; proposal was not negotiable procedure; it did not affect methods or means of performing work and was not electively negotiable); <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg Ass'n of Educators, NEA and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Sch.</span>, 30 FLRA 508, 533 (1987) (prohibiting certain monitoring techniques and results of observations). But there are exceptions. A proposal was negotiable that the agency provide a list of errors to technicians and consistently apply that definition to unit employees. The proposal was analogous to FLRA decisions requiring bargaining on proposals calling on employers to notify employees of the elements of their jobs that are subject to performance rating and to identify those elements deemed critical. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Gen. Comm. of AFGE for SSA Locals and SSA</span>, 23 FLRA 329, 335 (1986) (Proposal 5). A proposal was negotiable that required that work based on the words "other duties as assigned" shall not be used for performance appraisal. It did no more than require specification of duties in a position description before those duties could be used to assign performance standards. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 25 and Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 13 FLRA 433, 435 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals were nonnegotiable that defined errors, prohibited management from considering certain mistakes in evaluating accuracy of work, and assigned varying degrees of importance to categories of errors. They interfered with management's right to set performance standards and assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 15 FLRA 909, 912 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA, Baltimore</span>, 25 FLRA 16, 20-21 (1987) (Proposal 2, defining work errors, was nonnegotiable because it precluded management from considering certain errors in evaluation of accuracy of employees' work). A proposal was nonnegotiable that management classify, in a certain manner, errors committed by employees. The proposal interfered with the right to set performance standards. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Council of Consol. SSA Locals and DHHS, SSA</span>, 17 FLRA 657, 659 (1985) (Proposal 3). Also nonnegotiable was a proposal that precluded the charging of errors if they were only discovered during certain quality assurance audits. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 28 FLRA 714, 725 (1987) (Proposal 11); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1709 and Dept. of Air Force, Dover AFB</span>, 56 FLRA 549, 551-53 (2000) (nonnegotiable Proposal 1: that quality assessment program not be used as basis for disciplinary or performance-based action; proposal was not assessed as arrangement). Management could not be compelled to negotiate a proposal that student test results not be used to evaluate bargaining unit teachers. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 872 F.2d 1032, 1034 (D.C. Cir. 1988). But a proposal was negotiable that employees whose performance evaluation depended on completion of defined projects record time spent <span id="page_1096"></span>training others in appropriate accounting codes. The proposal did not affect management's rights to assign work, establish standards, or appraise work. <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 954, 957-59 (1993) (Provision 2).</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable as an appropriate arrangement was Provision 2 in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 731, 736-39 (1991), that "[p]erformance on one OFP [performance measure] that does not reflect the employee's usual level of performance should not be allowed to unduly influence an overall rating." According to FLRA (whose rationale for allowing the proposal was clearer than its explanation of the operation of the proposal):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the provision constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Based on the facts of this case, we find as a threshold matter that the provision is an arrangement for adversely affected employees. The Union's argument regarding the purpose of the provision is two fold. First, the Union maintains that the provision is intended to ameliorate the adverse effects on an employee's performance evaluation where that employee is given job tasks that are more difficult than those assigned to other employees. Second, the Union contends that the provision also protects employees who compete with the evaluated employee when the evaluated employee is being given easier job tasks. Based on these intended purposes, we find that the provision is intended as an arrangement for adversely affected employees. By preventing an OFP that is not reflective of an employee's usual performance from unduly influencing an evaluation, the provision ameliorates the adverse effects on an employee who has been given difficult job tasks. In addition, the provision accommodates situations where individuals must compete with an employee who is consistently given easier job tasks. Thus, the provision establishes a method for ameliorating such adverse effects that could arise from the Agency's assignment of work. Consequently, it is an arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we must determine whether the arrangement is "appropriate"... It is clear that the provision would benefit certain employees. Moreover, we find that interference with management's rights is limited. The provision does not prevent management from evaluating an employee on all criteria established in the performance standards. The provision merely requires the Agency to subjectively consider any uncharacteristic OFP rating when giving an employee an overall evaluation. Significantly, the provision does not place an absolute requirement on the Agency's determination regarding such an OFP rating, but, rather, allows the Agency the flexibility of determining how to accommodate the uncharacteristic rating without causing undue harm or granting undue benefit to any employee. Because the restriction on management's ability to evaluate employees is limited, we find that the provision does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that errors involving judgmental or discretionary issues be for informational purposes only was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement. The proposal was intended to protect employees who take actions in reliance on agency guidance when, on review, the supervisor disagrees with the course of action selected, even though the action was among those prescribed by the agency. Failure to communicate an agency preference to an employee in effect prevented the agency from subsequently finding unacceptable an employee's choice among alternatives it already identified as acceptable. The proposal did not interfere with the authority of the agency to identify critical elements or set performance standards. The proposal did not protect employees from negative evaluations if they failed or refused to seek advice, when directed by management, in selecting from among authorized options. The proposal did not prevent the agency from eliminating options or identifying one or more options as preferable to others. There was no interference with the right to assign work. The proposal established a general and nonquantitative standard, an appropriate arrangement for bargaining. FLRA stressed that it was not precluding agencies from exercising management rights to make the exercise of sound judgment a critical element and to establish standards for performance for that element. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Gen. Comm. of AFGE for SSA Locals and SSA</span>, 23 FLRA 329, 333-34 (1986) (Proposal 4). Negotiable were Proposals 5 and 6 in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 48 FLRA 129, 155 (1993), that management identify for the union minor work errors discovered, but excused by management. The information provided guidance to employees concerning what are considered errors under a new performance plan governing patent classification duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that tied management's ability to fault employees if their performance conformed with agency handbooks or written instructions. The nonnegotiable proposal precluded an employee from being adversely appraised if his or her work conformed with handbooks or written instructions, <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 48 FLRA 129, 143-48 (1993) (Proposal 2) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 47 F.3d 1217 (D.C. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) is subject to applicable laws.... Thus, if Proposal 2 merely incorporated into the contract a requirement imposed by the laws that govern performance appraisal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301-4305, it would be negotiable.... Based on the reasons that follow, we find that Proposal 2 is not confined to incorporating applicable statutory limitations into the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 performance standards and critical elements for an employee's position must be communicated to employees. However, that section does not prohibit an error from being treated as such simply because an employee has not been informed ahead of time that a particular action would constitute an error. In this regard, in the context of actions that are based on unacceptable performance taken pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, section 4302 requires that employees be informed of deficiencies in their performance during the appraisal period and given an opportunity to improve. That is, a performance standard may be "fleshed out and implemented in detail" during an improvement period undertaken to provide an employee whose performance has been determined as unsatisfactory with an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance prior to instituting a performance-based action.... However, fleshing out a standard may not amount to rewriting or changing the standard....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 places a general prohibition on considering any classification practice or procedure an error if it is set forth in the three specified manuals.&#x2003;By its terms, the performance appraisal plan that the proposal addresses, which was submitted by the Union, does not explicitly require compliance with those manuals as a general matter. A review of that plan shows that it consists of seven critical elements, several of which require evaluation of the quality of the employee's work. Only one of those critical elements, Element IV, explicitly refers to the DUPACS, MPEP and the U.S. Patent Classification Practice and Procedure--the three manuals specified in the proposal. Also submitted with the petition were "Guidelines" for rating each of the seven elements.... The Guidelines for some of the elements make reference to the DUPACS. However, the Guidelines are not incorporated into the performance appraisal plan itself; rather, their express purpose is to assist "SPCs" in rating Classifiers on the element to which they apply. In view of the fact that the scope of the proposal is broader than Element IV, we find that it is not limited to circumstances that would amount to the Agency effecting a change in the written performance standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the fact that Proposal 2 is not limited to requiring that the Agency exercise its management rights in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, we conclude that it directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. In reaching this conclusion, we note that Proposal 2 is distinguishable from Proposal 4 in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, General Committee of AFGE for SSA Locals and Social Security Administration</span>, 23 FLRA 329, 333-34 (1986).... The Authority found that Proposal 4, which provided that errors involving judgmental or discretionary issues were for informational purposes only, was negotiable because it was limited to circumstances in which the employee was free to choose among alternative courses of action that had been identified as acceptable by management. Proposal 2 is not so limited. Additionally, we find that Proposal 2 is distinguishable from part (a) of Proposal 4 in <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 28 FLRA at 720, on which the Union relies. Part (a) was limited to requiring that the agency provide employees with written guidance and reference materials necessary to perform their jobs in a satisfactory manner and did not bar holding employees accountable for their performance in the event of a failure to provide such guidance and materials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Now we turn to the Union's assertion that Proposal 2 is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. To do this, we apply the analytical framework established in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case we will assume without deciding that Proposal 2 is an arrangement.&#x2003;However, for the reasons that follow we find that it excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. This proposal would offer significant benefits to employees who are confronted with conflicting work rules. The proposal would shield them from having their choice of action considered an error as long as they chose a practice or procedure that accorded with the three cited manuals absent a written countermand to those practices or procedures and would protect them from any negative effects that errors could have on their performance appraisals. Thus, the proposal would eliminate the risk that employees incur when they act in the face of conflicting work rules and would afford them more security and certainty in their work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the proposal imposes a burden on management by preventing it from holding employees accountable for their work performance in all instances when they applied a classification practice or procedure set forth in the cited manuals regardless of the circumstances involved. For example, it does not permit consideration of the extent to which a reasonably competent professional should recognize that a different choice of practice or procedure is called for. Moreover, even when an employee has been advised orally of a change in procedures, an employee cannot be held accountable for following the procedure that has been countermanded. It might be argued that the Agency can easily escape the burden by providing written countermands to the policies and practices contained in the three manuals. However, this does not take into consideration instances where employees have been <span id="page_1097"></span>given specific oral instructions or where the Agency is dependent on employees to bring to its attention the fact that a circumstance has arisen in which existing work rules conflict or an exception to the practices and procedures in the three manuals is called for. Thus, while the Agency bears the major burden for providing employees with comprehensive and nonconflicting guidelines and instructions regarding work practices and procedures, it is unreasonable to expect the total elimination of conflicts and deficiencies. Moreover, it is reasonable to expect employees to bear some responsibility for recognizing the existence of conflicts and the need for augmentation or clarification and seeking guidance and instructions to resolve such problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Proposal 2 would immunize employees from accountability for their work performance without regard to the circumstances involved, we find that it imposes a significant burden on management's right to direct employees and assign work. We further find that the burden imposed on management's rights outweighs the benefit afforded employees and that this proposal excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that Proposal 2 excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work, we find that this proposal is distinguishable from Provision 11 in <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span> [<span class="Italic">supra</span>, calling for agreement that "no employee shall be held responsible for matters beyond his control."]. In concluding that Provision 11 constituted an appropriate arrangement, we found that the burden placed on the agency to avoid appraising employees on matters outside their control was slight in view of the fact that the agency retained the discretion to establish performance elements and standards reflecting the work for which employees are responsible. 47 FLRA at 36. We find that Proposal 2 imposes a more significant burden on management. In particular, Proposal 2 would require the Agency, as a condition to holding employees accountable for their work performance, to assume responsibility for providing employees with written instructions resolving any conflicts with the work practices and procedures set forth in the three cited manuals. This responsibility would exist even in circumstances where the Agency had specifically instructed employees orally as to the preferred practice or where the Agency was dependent upon employees to alert it to the existence of a conflict in their individual work situations regardless of whether the employee had done so.</p>
<p class="noindent">The result reached by FLRA concerning Proposal 2 in <span class="Italic">POPA</span> was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 47 F.3d 1217, 1222-23 (D.C. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Proposal No. 2</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Any classification practice or procedure which is set forth in [one of three listed PCS manuals] shall not be considered an error unless the employee was given timely written notice of a change in the practice or procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that its Proposal No.&#x2003;2 would help a patent classifier to know what is to be done in any given situation. According to the Union, it would not require that all procedures be specified in writing, but it would insulate a classifier from adverse evaluation insofar as he or she followed a written procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority, however, agreed with the PTO that this proposal would limit in two ways management's ability to direct employees. First, it would make it difficult for the PTO to supplement a practice or procedure as soon as a novel problem arises, i.e., without taking the time necessary to revise a written manual. Second, it would prevent the PTO from holding a classifier accountable in a situation calling for the exercise of professional judgment, i.e., where the manuals are incomplete or contradictory or where application of a rule in a particular situation to which it nominally applies would be inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See POPA II</span>, 48 FLRA at 141.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that would require an agency merely to provide its employees with documentation relating to the exercise of a management right, and would not place a substantive limitation upon the exercise of that right, is generally negotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 47 F.L.R.A. 705 (1993). The Authority reasonably concluded, however, that Proposal No. 2 runs afoul of this general rule by foreclosing upon management's ability to evaluate and to take corrective action against a classifier for his or her handling of a situation covered in a manual, even where some other authority--a written or an oral directive, a conflicting provision in another manual, or even common sense--dictates otherwise. <span class="Italic">POPA II</span>, 48 F.L.R.A. at 141. The proposal would effectively require that the PTO's manuals cover each situation a patent classifier may face, regardless whether the situation was reasonably foreseeable. This would intrude substantially upon management's ability to direct employees and to assign them work requiring the exercise of judgment. Indeed, the result could be similar to what British labor unions achieve by "working to rule," namely the tangle that inevitably occurs when a bureaucracy is bound and gagged with red tape--no matter that the tape is of its own making.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the Union give us cause to upset the Authority's conclusion that Proposal No. 2 is not an "appropriate arrangement." Granted, an employee would be better off under a scheme that offers a safe harbor if he or she sails strictly by the book. The only question is whether the Authority was unreasonable in concluding that the proposal fails the balancing test of <span class="Italic">KANG </span>because "it does not permit consideration of the extent to which a reasonably competent professional should recognize that a different choice of practice or procedure is called for." <span class="Italic">POPA</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>, 48 F.L.R.A. at 146. We think it eminently reasonable to suppose that binding management to the black letter of its manuals in every situation would excessively interfere with its ability to set performance standards for employees to meet and procedures for employees to follow.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to another POPA proposal with similar import, the court explained, with a similar result of nonnegotiability, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 47 F.3d 1217, 1223 (D.C. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Proposal No. 7</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Management shall identify...the circumstances under which it will consider that a [Patent] Classifier has committed an error in the assignment of an application even though (1) an examiner has, or would have, accepted the application for examination purposes from the [ ] Classifier, or (2) the [ ] Classifier relied on an informal understanding between patent examiners which was contrary to written definitions or classification rules. If [these circumstances are not identified], then classifiers shall be entitled to assume that the two identified situations are not errors for evaluation purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims this proposal was designed to "elicit specific direction" in controversial classifications by allowing the classifier safely to assume that his or her classification was proper if either the examiner to whom he or she referred the assignment accepted it or the classifier was relying upon an "informal understanding" between examiners as to the proper classification. Therefore, says the Union, the proposal would require only that the PTO give classifiers notice of any change from established classification procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Authority, however, the proposal is not so sharply drawn; it would, in essence, require the PTO "to anticipate at the time it prepares the performance plan all possible circumstances in which a classifier's assignment of an application would be erroneous," <span class="Italic">POPA II</span>, 48 F.L.R.A. at 164. Thus, like Proposal No. 2, Proposal No. 7 would effectively prohibit the agency from holding a classifier accountable for his or her Performance in any situation that the PTO had not anticipated and addressed in writing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is apparently significant room for disagreement over the proper classification of many a patent; as with all but the few entirely mechanical aspects of life, the exercise of judgment is required. The Authority concluded that to take away the PTO's right to treat adversely a classifier who fails to exercise good judgment, so as to minimize error and expense, in what are by definition the most difficult cases, would invade the territory protected by &#x00A7; 7106(a) under the heading of management rights. For the same reason, the Authority also concluded that Proposal No. 7 is not negotiable as an "appropriate arrangement." The Union has asserted the contrary, but does not thereby establish that either conclusion involves an impermissible construction of the terms of the statute or an arbitrary or capricious exercise of the Authority's expertise.</p>
