<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-88"><span class="space">e.</span> Work Assignments; Reassignments; Details</h5>
<p class="noindent">A reassignment affecting two employees was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. One employee was transferred to a location requiring more than an additional hour of commuting each way; for the other employee the commuting time was increased by about half an hour for each trip. Bargaining was required over impact, but a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy was not directed due to disruption of agency operations. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 20 FLRA 474, 477 (1985). In <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 37 FLRA 278, 285 (1990), reassignment of one employee from a field representative to a claims representative position was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and warranted an order directing restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> and back pay (as a remedy for lost overtime) when the reassignment was effected without bargaining over impact and implementation and without bargaining over negotiable proposals advanced by the union following notice of the reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 29 FLRA 891 (1987) (change involved where duties would be performed during period of renovation of facilities); <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 2052</span>, 8 FLRA 604, 617 (1982) (ALJ Decision) (reassignment of employee involves a relocation of work performance and requires impact bargaining). But the right to assign work implies the right to determine the priority of assignments to be completed. If the work required remains the same, but priorities as to its completion are changed, there has been no change in working conditions requiring impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 38</span>, 17 FLRA 227, 233-35 (1985) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council 236</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-060.html">62 FLRA 341</a>, 343 (2008) (reviewing arbitration award: change in rotational schedule that could impact ability of employees to have opportunity to send their children to particular school was appropriate basis for arbitrator <span id="Page_1325"></span>to conclude that effects of change were more than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>and required impact negotiations). Workload increases, by themselves, without affirmative management action, do not trigger impact bargaining requirements. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 577, 579-80 (2012). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-070.html#sec8-71">Change in Employment Conditions</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The effect of reassignments of two employees to work at other than the housing units where they were ordinarily assigned at a military base, when their job descriptions called for them to perform maintenance and other duties at any of the base housing units, was not clearly <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. Further evaluation was required on remand to the ALJ of the impact of the reassignments, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Tyndall AFB and AFGE Local 3240</span>, 65 FLRA 877, 880-81 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC contends that the Judge erred in concluding that: (1) the Respondent did not change the employees' conditions of employment; and (2) even if there was a change in the employees' conditions of employment, such change was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, in order to determine whether an agency's action violated the Statute, there must first be a finding that the agency changed unit employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., INS, Houston</span>, 50 FLRA at 143. The determination of whether a change in conditions of employment has occurred involves a case-by-case analysis and an inquiry into the facts and circumstances regarding the agency's conduct and employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 144; <span class="Italic">92 Bomb Wing, Fairchild Air Force Base, Spokane, Wash.</span>, 50 FLRA 701, 704 (1995). Also, in determining whether a judge's factual findings are supported, the Authority looks to the preponderance of the record evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, an agency is obligated to bargain over the impact and implementation of a change only where that change has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., PBGC</span>, 59 FLRA at 50. In assessing whether the effect of a change in conditions of employment is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either the effect or the reasonably foreseeable effect of the change. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 51.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the above legal standards to the facts in this case, we find that the Judge failed to make the necessary factual findings for us to determine whether the Respondent's reassignments of Employees A and B constituted a change in their conditions of employment, and, if so, whether such change was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the change in conditions of employment, the Judge found that, within the Sand Dollar Inn, there were "no fixed assignments and no permanent duty stations at particular locations" and that the Respondent's policy and practice "was to assign and alter which laborers would perform their duties at the various...locations...depending upon leave, availability, work load[,] and mission necessity." As further support for his conclusion, the Judge noted that the record showed that the work assignments at issue did not "result in a change to the substantive duties required of any laborer in the...unit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC disputes the Judge's findings, asserting that the Judge, in so holding, "omitted" pertinent facts, specifically that there was "no history of routinely changing the <span class="Italic">permanent </span>duty stations of employees" and that "past routine assignments to alternate work locations were <span class="Italic">only </span>to cover for absences based on leave illness, scheduled days off or some specific overriding project." Moreover, the GC argues that the Judge omitted pertinent facts that would have shown that Wood Manor is substantially different from other locations, including that: (1) Wood Manor consists of fifty-two separate buildings that can house families; (2) the size of the units increases the amount of trash and outside work; (3) outside work has virtually no shade; (4) there is only one break area and the availability of water is limited; (5) the site is in a remote location, a few miles from the other locations; (6) there are no restaurants or food services within walking distance; and (7) employees must use personal vehicles to get to the site or go to lunch.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge failed to discuss--and thus failed expressly to credit or discredit--much of the evidence presented regarding the employees' reassignments, including the duration and permanence of the employees' assignments, as well as the substantive duties required of each employee at the relevant locations. Because the Judge failed to make the necessary factual findings, we are unable to determine whether the Respondent's reassignment of Employees A and B constituted a change in their conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also found that, even if there had been a change in the employees' conditions of employment, the impact of the change was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> because the laborers were subject to performing substantially similar duties at the various lodging locations operated by the Respondent. As noted above, the Judge failed to discuss much of the evidence regarding the substantive duties required of Employee A and Employee B at the relevant work locations. As a result, we are unable to determine whether the change in the employees' conditions of employment, if such change occurred, was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because we are unable to determine whether the Respondent's reassignment of Employees A and B constituted a change in their conditions of employment, and, if so, whether, such change was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, we remand the case to the Judge for further consideration. On remand, consistent with this decision, the Judge should, in determining whether a violation of the Statute occurred, evaluate the contrary evidence and make the necessary factual findings regarding the reassignments of Employees A and B.</p>
<p class="noindent">A change was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> that involved an assignment of work to one classification of employee rather than to another: the assignment was temporary, meant to reduce a backlog, and lasted no more than two months; the change affected no more than four or five of 95 unit office employees of a much larger national bargaining unit; the change did not affect promotional or retention opportunities; there was no evidence as to past practice concerning the temporary reassignment of duties and no bargaining history over analogous changes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Program Operations, SSA, San Francisco and AFGE, Council of Social Security Dist. Office Locals</span>, 20 FLRA 97, 99 (1985). FLRA rejected as <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> a change that separated out a data entry function from an adjudication or authorization function of a claims examiner. The new management directive had no effect on the employees' grade qualification, work functions, or other working conditions. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Chicago Region and AFGE</span>, 15 FLRA 922, 924 (1984). A reorganization's effect was no more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> when the nature of the employee's duties remained the same although cases were reassigned. The reassignments of 10 employees to unclassified duties were temporary. The total effect of the reorganization was upon 10 employees in a consolidated national unit of 200 professional employees, or, in the alternative, in a group of 8,000 nonprofessional employees. <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE</span>, 20 FLRA 374, 377 (1985) (result might be different under more recent decisions disavowing proportion of employees in unit affected as component of <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> analysis). There was no duty to engage in impact bargaining over the institution of a rotational system for the assignment of typists when there was no adverse effect, e.g., no increase in overtime or other duties, resulting from the change. The effect was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 16 FLRA 740, 741 (1984). But impact bargaining was required over a plan by management to rotate receptionist duties among a group of employees. <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 3701</span>, 58 FLRA 33, 34-35 (2002). Reassignment of some work to employees did not rise above <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact, even though the duties were in addition to the employees' regular duties and were ordinarily performed by other employees. The nature of the duties remained the same as were previously performed. They did not require any measurable additional time to perform or require added skills or travel. The assignment of duties was temporary. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 20 FLRA 481, 484 (1985). Discontinuation of recertification training assignments for a small group of instructors was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> in its impact. The loss of the work was relatively small in comparison to the total duties assigned, and there was no indication that the trainers would be more vulnerable to a RIF. The agency announced a RIF, but there was no showing that the number of trainers would be reduced. The vulnerability of the trainers was speculative, not reasonably foreseeable. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 4</span>, 45 FLRA 574, 576-78 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">A significant addition to the duties of an employee is a change in working conditions that warrants notice to the union and impact bargaining, if requested. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Atlanta and AFGE</span>, 11 FLRA 419, 428 (1983) (ALJ Decision). There is an obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of changes in job duties. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Army, Hq., Ft. Sam Houston and AFGE Local 2154</span>, 8 FLRA 623, 638 (1982) (ALJ Decision). Modification of the forms used by case analysts required new, more complex, and time-consuming duties. Impact bargaining was required because of the duties and the effect of those duties on the ratings of the employees. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 16 FLRA 56, 70 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Scheduling appointments for claims representatives on Fridays was a change in past practice that violated implementation bargaining requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Gilroy Branch and AFGE Local 3172</span>, 53 FLRA 1358 (1998) (ALJ Decision). An increase in temporary supervisory responsibilities for guards was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Willow Grove ARS and NAGE Local R3-32</span>, 57 FLRA 852, 857 (2002), <span class="Italic">reconsideration granted, result unchanged</span>, 58 FLRA 277 (2003). A reduction in clinical privileges for two VA physicians was a change in duties sufficient to warrant impact bargaining. The physicians suffered an obvious limitation on their future assignments as well as on their retention standing. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Muskogee and AFGE Local 2250</span>, 25 FLRA 875, 879 (1987). A change from one- or two-day voluntary details to 30-day mandatory details required impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Serv. Ctr. and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 98, 1125-27 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Assignment of employees to 120-day details, involving different supervisors but essentially the same work, required impact bargaining. The change involved the reasonably foreseeable effect of impact upon performance appraisal and promotional opportunities. <span class="Italic">DHHS, Family Support Admin. and NTEU</span>, 30 FLRA 346 (1987) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA Area IX and AFGE Council 147</span>, 51 FLRA 357 (1995) (ALJ Decision) (impact bargaining should have occurred as to 120-day detail when effect on employee was not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924,</span> 64 FLRA 85, 89-90 (2009), the employer committed a ULP by not providing notice and opportunity to the union to bargain to the extent permitted by law of the addition of one set of duties to a single employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1326"></span>It is well established that, prior to implementing a change in conditions of employment, an agency is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain, if the change will have more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't. of the Treasury, IRS,</span> 56 FLRA 906, 913 (2000). In applying the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change in bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Phoenix, Ariz.,</span> 47 FLRA 419, 423 (1993). In determining whether the reasonably foreseeable effects of a change are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis,</span> the Authority addresses what a respondent knew, or should have known, at time of the change. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Asserting that &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute distinguishes between "conditions of employment" and "working conditions[,]" and that a change in the latter is outside the duty to bargain, the Respondent claims that it had no duty to bargain over the assignment of new duties to employee H because it only changed his working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The task of resolving a dispute over the meaning of a statutory provision "begins where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute itself." <span class="Italic">7th Infantry Div. (Light), Fort Ord, Cal.</span>, 47 FLRA 864, 868 (1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span> <span class="Italic">v</span>.<span class="Italic"> Ron Pair Enterprises,</span> 489 U.S. 235, 241 (1989)). In this regard, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) defines "conditions of employment" as "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, <span class="Italic">affecting working conditions</span>[.]" (emphasis added). However, the Statute does not define "working conditions," and a majority of the Authority has previously declined to consider "working conditions" outside the context of "conditions of employment[.]" <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> 55 FLRA 978, 980 n.7 (1999) (Member Cabaniss dissenting). Similarly, although courts have defined "working conditions" under other statutes, they have not done so within the context of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Compare, e.g., So. Ry. Co. v. Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Review Comm'n,</span> 539 F.2d 335, 339 (4th Cir. 1976) (defining the term "working conditions[,]" as used under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1974, as "the environmental area" in which an employee performs his or her daily tasks) <span class="Italic">with, e.g., Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA,</span> 495 U.S. 641, 646 (1990) <span class="Italic">(Fort Stewart)</span> (although Court rejected definition of "working conditions" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute that related to physical conditions of the workplace, it did not define the term); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. FLRA,</span> 744 F.2d 842, 850 n.18 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although courts and the Authority have not defined "working conditions," when faced with issues involving "working conditions," they have accorded the term a broad interpretation that encapsulates a wide range of subjects that is effectively synonymous with "conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fort Stewart,</span> 495 U.S. at 646: <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Educ. Ass'n,</span> 22 FLRA 235, 237 (1986) (stating that, in examining whether a bargaining proposal effects "working conditions" of employees, the Authority examines the "work situation or employment relationship" of employees). Moreover, to the extent that courts and the Authority have attempted to make distinctions among conditions of employment, such distinctions arose in the context of assessing whether a change in conditions of employment was or was not <span class="Italic">de minimis.</span> <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council v. FLRA,</span> 446 F.3d 162, 167 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (court found that a reduction in remedial training for employees was a change in conditions of employment that was not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't. of the Treasury, IRS,</span> 62 FLRA 411, 414 (2008) (Authority found that agency's decision to discontinue past practice of granting leave to employees to attend annual employee appreciation day event was not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>). The foregoing establishes that, under court and Authority precedent, there is no substantive difference between "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" as those terms are practically applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has provided no other arguments challenging the Judge's finding that the Agency changed employee H's conditions of employment. Accordingly, we find that the Judge did not err by concluding that assignment changed Employee H's conditions of employment. Therefore, the Respondent was required to bargain over the impact and implementation of the changes to employee H's job duties so long as they had an effect that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also challenges the Judge's conclusion that the assignment had an effect that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis.</span> However, the Respondent's assertion that, despite the security checks assignment, employee H continues to spend the majority of his time on pre-existing duties, namely "driving" and "filling out forms[,]" is unsupported by the record. In this regard, the Judge's undisputed findings establish that, in addition to employee H's "normal job responsibilities[,]" employee H now: inspects landscape and aircraft; drives over rougher terrain<span class="Italic">;</span> must exercise "higher degrees of discretion and independent judgment" than he previously used<span class="Italic">;</span> and must electronically prepare daily and monthly written reports on a permanent basis. The Respondent also does not dispute the Judge's findings that employee H had to receive training before he could perform the security checks, and that employee H required computer assistance for eight days before he could electronically prepare the reports by himself since he had no experience with computers or email. Further, the Respondent does not dispute the Judge's finding that, prior to the new duties, employee H only filled out forms when he discovered discrepancies with the van's fluid levels, rather than on a daily or monthly basis. The foregoing sufficiently establishes that employee H's new duties related to performing security checks encompass more than "driving" and "filling out forms." Accordingly, we find that the Judge did not err by concluding that the change had an effect that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Judge did not err by concluding that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A change in a program that required increased travel--welcomed by some employees, avoided by others--was a change resulting in more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on unit employees and required impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 845, 860 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Management should have negotiated over the impact of a program allowing agency employees to accept temporary teaching assignments at local colleges. There was a reasonably foreseeable effect on the employees returning to their regular job after participation in the program, and there was a foreseeable impact on the employees remaining in the unit after the temporary relocation of the individuals participating in the teaching program. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 24 FLRA 999, 1012-13 (1986) (ALJ Decision). Management should have bargained over a decision to assign employees administrative duties for a month at a time on a rotating basis. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, OSHA and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE Local 644</span>, 24 FLRA 743, 746 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The reasonably foreseeable effects of program changes can be relatively small and still trigger an obligation to pursue impact bargaining. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 26 FLRA 344, 347 (1987), commented on the bargaining obligation arising from management's interest in instituting a Social Security Income Payment Review Redesign Study:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the reasonably foreseeable impact of implementation of the study in this case on the affected employees elevated it to a level where bargaining was appropriate.&#x2003;The study was to last for at least one year and the possibility clearly existed that the changes would become permanent. Moreover, the QRAs were required to collect and record additional information in 10 percent of their cases. While the QRAs apparently would not be adversely affected directly by any errors made in the new data, QRAs are rated on the timeliness of their cases. It was therefore reasonably foreseeable that the additional time required by the study, compounded by such matters as the allegedly inadequate preliminary training and the varying number of study cases that might be assigned to any particular QRA, would affect their performance on other cases, their performance evaluations and related personnel actions. Those foreseeable effects gave rise to a duty to bargain with the Union concerning the procedures to be utilized in the study and appropriate arrangements for employees who might be adversely affected by implementation of the study.</p>
<p class="noindent">Substantive negotiations are still limited by management rights. The agency need not negotiate on the amount of work that employees should be required to perform, even though there is an impact on the employees' ability to perform that work following a change in their working conditions, e.g., office layout or facilities. The right to assign work and determine its quantity is a management right. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Midwest Reg'l Office, Chicago and NTEU Chap. 95</span>, 16 FLRA 141, 144-45 (1984). A proposal made during impact bargaining that essentially bars management from assigning new duties to employees interferes with the right to assign work and is not negotiable. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1214 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Army Training Ctr.,</span> 11 FLRA 580 (1983). Yet management should have bargained with the union over a unilateral increase in the performance standard of unit employees by 50% after other unit employees were assigned to duties that adversely affected their personal safety. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 24 FLRA 786, 793 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VARO, San Diego and AFGE Local 490</span>, 44 FLRA 312, 320 (1992) (ALJ Decision) (management improperly changed productivity standards of file clerks unilaterally without bargaining over impact and implementation of change). A change in policy of allowing an employee "a reasonable opportunity" to improve performance before initiating a performance-based action to a policy limiting a performance improvement period to 30-90 days was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC and Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216, AFGE</span>, 48 FLRA 306, 310 (1993). [Refer in Chapter 6 to "<a href="0100-2023-14-623.html#sec6-636">Changes in Standards</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every change requires impact bargaining. The <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> rule has some practical application, although, given evolution in legal standards, it can be difficult to distinguish the bargainable from nonnegotiable changes. The change of an assignment for one employee did not result in more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact on the unit. There was a change in schedule but no change in grade, pay, or the required number of hours. Although shift rotation and holiday work would be required as a result of the reassignment, employees worked but one holiday a year and spent 80% of their time on one shift. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Phoenix and AFGE Local 2382</span>, 20 FLRA 399, 402 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, 20 FLRA 430, 434 (1985) (increased travel time for one employee assigned to a <span id="Page_1327"></span>new location: "impact or reasonably foreseeable impact of the assignment of new duties on the conditions of employment of the unit employees herein was no more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>). The reassignment of an employee, a union representative, from one work station to another, a distance of less than a mile, was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> in impact. There was no change in grade or pay, and the employee was still able to obtain official time to represent employees. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 63rd Civil Eng'r Squadron, Norton AFB and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 22 FLRA 843, 864-65 (1986) (ALJ Decision). A reassignment involving no real inconvenience or changes in employee benefits was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 29 FLRA 307, 326 (1987) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">GSA Region 9 and NFFE Local 81</span>, 52 FLRA 1107, 1112 (1997) (temporary geographical office move for employee, at union's request, that involved no loss of pay or change of hours, and involved only slight inconvenience, did not trigger bargaining obligation because impact was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>; "the Statute does not require bargaining every time an employee is slightly inconvenienced").</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency did not violate the Statute by unilaterally reassigning six unit employees from excepted to competitive service positions without notifying the union and allowing it an opportunity to engage in impact bargaining. The changes were no more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. Duties of the employees remained the same, the six employees were members of a unit of 1,900 employees, there was no past practice of bargaining concerning this type of change, and one employee experienced a temporary loss of pay but volunteered for the conversion. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Archives and AFGE Local 2578</span>, 20 FLRA 129, 133-34 (1985). Reassignment of two employees of a unit of 8,000 from one position to another in an office had no more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect. Pay and grade were unaffected, and there was no change in promotion potential. Foreseeable adverse impact was speculative. <span class="Italic">DHUD, Columbia Area Office and AFGE Local 3654</span>, 20 FLRA 233, 236 (1985). A different result may have been reached under more recent decisions disavowing the proportion of employees in unit affected as a component of <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1986, FLRA modified its <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> analysis with specific reference to a reassignment case. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1760</span>, 24 FLRA 403 (1986) (noted in an earlier discussion). That decision should be reviewed and compared with the foregoing decisions concerning analysis of bargaining obligations flowing from the reassignment of employees. Details of 20 revenue officers for 60 days required impact bargaining. The detail altered work schedules and lunch breaks and increased commuting distances. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 32</span>, 27 FLRA 664, 667 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and AFGE</span>, 39 FLRA 1060 (1991) (no contract waiver of right to negotiate impact of decision to detail four unit employees).</p>
