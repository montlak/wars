<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-203"><span class="space">10.</span> Interpretation of Agreement: External Law; Extrinsic or Parol Evidence; Ambiguous Term; History of Performance; Hearing</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Hardy v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-14-0344-I-1 (NP 12/5/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board interprets settlements pursuant to principles of contract law and examines whether the written understanding is clearly stated and, if ambiguous, ascertains the parties' intent at the time the agreement was made. <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement may be deemed to incorporate extrinsic law, <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 609, 626 n.4, 2010 MSPB 92 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...It is a well-settled principle in contract law, however, that because parties are presumed to be aware of applicable statutes and regulations and intend to incorporate them, the law existing at the time a contract is executed becomes a part of the contemporaneous circumstances of the contract's execution and is incorporated, without reference, into the agreement itself. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miura v. Department of the Navy,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 663, 669 n.5 (1989) ("[a] contract is deemed to incorporate all the rights conferred upon the parties by the laws of the state in which the contract was executed") (citing<span class="Italic"> N.C. Freed Co. v. Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System,</span> 473 F.2d 1210, 1215 (2d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 414 U.S. 827 (1973)); <span class="Italic">Ocean View Towers Associates v. United States,</span> 88 Fed. Cl. 169, 176 (2009) (the parties' failure to specifically incorporate a federal regulation into the contract had no bearing on the regulation's applicability to that contract because "the law becomes a part of the contemporaneous circumstances of the contract's execution and is incorporated, without reference, into the agreement itself"); <span class="Italic">Dart Advantage Warehousing, Inc. v. United States,</span> 52 Fed. Cl. 694, 700 (2002) (same). Thus, the appellant was not required to expressly bargain for the agency's compliance with the Privacy Act, or with any other laws, rules, or regulations that the agency is otherwise bound to obey.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. OPM</span>, DA-0841-15-0596-C-1 (NP 11/21/2016) ("[i]t is presumed that the parties are aware of the applicable retirement statutes and regulations and intend to incorporate them. <span class="Italic">Young v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 39 n.4 (2010)").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When parties seek to compel compliance with a settlement, questions may arise concerning the meaning of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Buzitksy v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 388, 390 &#x00B6; 5 (1999), explained the Board's approach to proof involving interpretation of settlements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A court-approved settlement agreement is subject to the general rules of construction and enforceability regarding contracts<span class="Italic">. Fredendall v. Veterans Administration,</span> 38 MSPR 366, 371 (1988), <span class="Italic">modified by Jones v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 61 MSPR 252 (1994). The ultimate burden is on the appellant to prove that the agency has not complied with the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once the appellant asserts an allegation of noncompliance, the agency must produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance with the agreement. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 61 MSPR at 254. In construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance, and parol evidence will be considered only if the written agreement is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Greco v.

<p class="Body-Text">The distinction between settlement terms that are clear, and those requiring interpretation through extrinsic or parol evidence (evidence extrinsic to the language of the agreement, e.g., testimony or negotiation notes, that explains what the parties meant by the disputed term), was developed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Melton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the settlement agreement is silent about Ms. Melton's AWOL debt. The most relevant sections are paragraphs 1 and 9, and these paragraphs specify a lump sum payment to Ms. Melton in exchange for her removal from the Agency. Paragraph 14 adds that "[n]o other promises or agreements shall be binding unless signed by all parties and expressly designated as an amendment to this agreement." Nothing in the settlement agreement addresses whether the Agency may or may not collect debts duly owed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, parol evidence on the matter of Ms. Melton's AWOL debt is inapposite. In the unambiguous language of the agreement itself, the Agency did not agree to waive its right to collect Ms. Melton's AWOL debt nor is there any implication of such a waiver.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit found another agreement without ambiguity, <span class="Italic">Ammons v. VA</span>, 476 Fed. Appx. 270, 272-73 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the settlement agreement and agree with the Board's conclusions that it was unambiguous and provided that Ms. Ammons would withdraw all of her causes of actions, including her EEOC complaint. Ms. Ammons's reliance on parol evidence is misplaced. We have previously held that parol evidence is admissible only if there is ambiguity in the words of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Here, paragraph one of the settlement agreement, in which Ms. Ammons unmistakably withdrew "all appeals and complaints," and "waive[d] her right to pursue future causes of action arising out of facts in existence as of the date of [her] execution of this Agreement[,]" was unambiguous and does not warrant consideration of parol evidence. Indeed, paragraph seventeen stated that the settlement agreement constituted "the entire understanding between the [p]arties" and that "there were no other terms or commitments, oral or written." Notably, other portions of the settlement agreement explicitly rely on the waiver provisions of paragraph one. For example, paragraph eight of the settlement agreement provided the VA permission to submit a copy of the settlement agreement to the Board, EEOC, Office of Resolution Management, "or any other third party as evidence of withdrawal or waiver of any claim to be withdrawn or waived hereunder." Even more to the point, it makes no sense to remove paragraph one of the settlement agreement because Ms. Ammons's "entire consideration is encompassed in that paragraph." In other words, under Ms. Ammons's asserted modification, her record at the VA would be wiped clean in exchange for nothing. Because the terms of the agreement were clear and comprehensive, we agree with the Board's determination that parol evidence was not permissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Ammons also asserts that the Board committed harmful error by failing to make notes of off the record discussions regarding the deletion of paragraph one from the parties' settlement agreement and further requests that the video of the parties' discussions be made part of the record. However, as discussed above, the terms of the settlement agreement were clear and unambiguous. Accordingly, we conclude that the Board properly determined that parol evidence, such as the alleged discussion between the parties in which they agreed to remove paragraph one, was not permissible.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, to the extent that the settlement agreement contained a latent ambiguity, i.e., an ambiguity that is not glaring, substantial, or patently obvious, the administrative judge could construe the ambiguous term against the drafter of the contract if the nondrafter's interpretation is reasonable<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The AJ properly concluded that the Settlement Agreement plainly and unambiguously set out the obligations of the Army and that those obligations had been fulfilled.

The absence in the agreement of any specific terms prohibiting the agency from disclosing documents to the examining psychiatrist is not, however, dispositive because contract provisions must be read "as part of an organic whole, according reasonable meaning to all of the contract terms" to identify and give weight to the "spirit" or essence of the contract as intended by the parties. <span class="Italic">Lockheed Martin IR Imaging Systems, Inc. v.

Thus, one reasonable interpretation of the term "independent medical examination" is, as the appellant contends, that the examination is wholly independent from any involvement or influence by the agency. Under this interpretation of the term "independent medical examination," the agency's disclosure of documents to Dr. Ruth concerning the appellant would likely constitute a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency appears to contend that "independent medical examination" has a specific meaning within this context like a term of art, a meaning different from the one proffered by the appellant. Specifically, the agency's representative asserted during a status conference below that it is the agency's pattern and practice to submit relevant medical information, and any relevant information concerning the employee's job and his ability to perform his job, with or without reasonable accommodation, to the doctor conducting the fitness <span id="Page_5078"></span>for duty examination for his review and consideration. The agency's representative further contended during the status conference that the physician conducting an independent medical examination is "independent" in that the physician does not work for either of the parties and has not evaluated the employee in the past, and the physician should take into consideration any materials submitted for his review, and giving consideration to such materials does not compromise the independence of the physician's examination. While the statements of the agency's representative during the status conference below do not constitute evidence, the agency's disclosure of documents to Dr. Ruth is consistent with its apparent understanding of what constitutes an independent medical examination. <span class="Italic">See Spradlin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 279, &#x00B6; 8 (1999); <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Department of the Army,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 673, 678 (1993) (the parties' conduct after they have entered into a settlement agreement may be relevant to an interpretation of terms in the agreement). Thus, it appears that the agency interprets the term "independent medical examination" as an examination conducted by a physician who is "independent" of the parties, i.e., not employed and/or under the "control" or "influence" of the agency or the appellant, but the agency does not interpret this term as prohibiting it from providing additional documentation to the examining physician for his consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, because the term "independent medical examination" is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hammons v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 54, 57-58 (finding the term "correspondence relating to this case" ambiguous and relying on parol evidence to determine the intent of the parties as to the meaning of this term), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 66 F.3d 346 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Therefore, to interpret this term of the agreement, which is pertinent in resolving whether the agency materially breached the agreement, extrinsic evidence should be used to determine the intent of the parties at the time of the agreement. The record as developed to date, however, does not contain the evidence necessary to resolve this issue. Accordingly, this case must be remanded to allow the parties to submit extrinsic evidence into the record regarding what each party meant by the term "independent medical examination." This will enable the administrative judge to determine the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the settlement agreement. Specifically, the administrative judge should consider whether the parties understood and agreed that: (1) the agency would have no involvement with the examining psychiatrist, i.e. that it would not communicate with the examining psychiatrist or provide him with additional documentation concerning the appellant; or (2) the agency could release the types of materials it routinely releases in fitness for duty examinations, consistent with its own rules or established practice, to provide the examining psychiatrist a complete understanding of the nature of the agency's concerns in ascertaining the employee's psychiatric fitness for duty. While the record as developed to date suggests that these are the prevailing interpretations of the parties with regard to the term "independent medical examination," the administrative judge is not precluded from finding yet another interpretation based on extrinsic evidence provided by the parties on remand. <span class="Italic">See Sweet v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 15 (2001). The administrative judge may hold a hearing if he finds it necessary to resolve credibility issues concerning these issues. <span class="Italic">See Madison v. Department of Defense,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 8 (2009) (although an employee is not entitled to a hearing to establish his allegations in an enforcement proceeding, the administrative judge may grant one in his discretion, if necessary to resolve disputed facts), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> No. 2009-3285 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 22, 2010) (NP); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(3). If the administrative judge finds that one meaning of the term prevails over the other, then the administrative judge shall further adjudicate the appellant's petition for enforcement as instructed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge finds, however, that the parties did not have a meeting of the minds with respect to the meaning of the term "independent medical examination," then there is no reason for choosing one interpretation rather than the other, as no party has reason to rely on the understanding of the other party. <span class="Italic">See Gullette v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 569, 575-77 (1996).

Therefore, if the administrative judge finds that: (1) the parties had differing, but reasonable interpretations of the term "independent medical examination"; (2) neither party had reason to know of the meaning attached by the other; and (3) the term in question is an essential part of the settlement agreement, then the administrative judge should allow the appellant the opportunity to: (1) set aside the settlement agreement and reinstate her enforced leave appeal; or (2) accept the settlement agreement under the agency's interpretation of the term "independent medical examination." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gullette,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. at 576-77 (where the parties had differing and reasonable views of the term "anniversary date" in an settlement agreement, and neither party knew or had reason to know of the meaning attached by the other, the Board gave the appellant the opportunity to reinstate her removal appeal or to accept the settlement agreement under the agency's interpretation of the term because the term in question was an essential part of the agreement).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the agency failed to submit competent evidence that it complied with the settlement agreement because it did not establish that it transmitted to her insurance carrier the Standard Form (SF)-2801 showing that her benefits were reinstated and that her evidence that the agency did not transmit the form is undisputed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract and the interpretation of its terms is a question of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v.

These documents show that the agency met its obligations under the terms of the settlement agreement. As the administrative judge found, the appellant does not dispute these documents. Rather, she contends that the agency breached the agreement by failing to transmit to the carrier the SF-2810 showing the reinstatement of her health benefits, as evidenced by the carrier's statement that it has not received the appellant's health benefit enrollment forms. She repeats her claim that her receiving health benefits for as long as possible was a key component of the agreement and that the agency breached the agreement by not showing that it acted promptly in transmitting to her carrier the SF-2801 showing the reinstatement of her benefits.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board was previously reluctant to accept evidence concerning the meaning of settlement agreements. The Board's current approach to the problem of an ambiguous settlement agreement may have been aided by resolution of a case, unfortunately nonprecedential, decided by the Federal Circuit. Of the proper method of analysis of settlement agreements, the court decided in <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3388):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of this court's review of board decisions is limited by statute, 5 USC 7703(c). A settlement agreement, however, is a contract, and it is well settled that the interpretation of a contract is a question of law and that an administrative board's interpretation of a contract is not binding on the court. <span class="Italic">Bonner v. MSPB</span>, 781 F.2d 202, 205 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Fortec Constructors v. United States</span>, 760 F.2d 1288, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Here the board stated that because it found "the settlement agreement not ambiguous as to the nature of Mr. Vaughn's reinstatement," no clarification of the terms of the agreement was necessary. We cannot agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dictionary definition of the word "reinstate" is "to place again...in a former position" or "to restore to a previous effective state."...In view of this definition, there was ambiguity whether the settlement agreement entitled Mr. Vaughn to be returned to his former position or at least to a position of the same type, i.e., another full-time permanent position in the Motor Vehicle Craft. As a general rule, extrinsic evidence, including testimony regarding the intentions of the parties, is admissible to clarify ambiguous terms in a contract. <span class="Italic">United States v. Human Resources Management, Inc.</span>, 745 F.2d 642, 648 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The board, in stating <span id="Page_5080"></span>that no clarification of the settlement agreement was necessary, appears to have refused to consider evidence proffered by Mr. Vaughn in an attempt to show that the Postal Service's representative verbally agreed to return him to his previous status as a regular employee. Because there is at least an ambiguity in the contract as to the use of the term "reinstate," the board erred in not considering testimony of the parties or their representatives, or other extrinsic evidence, to determine the intent of the parties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit declared in <span class="Italic">Harris v. VA</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1998), that "[i]f there is an ambiguity in the formation of the agreement or during its performance, we implement the intent of the parties at the time the agreement was struck." Although the Board recognizes that it should consider parol evidence if the terms of the settlement are ambiguous, <span class="Italic">Shafer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 164, 169-70 (1990) (nonetheless denying a hearing), the Board continues to insist, when it can do so, that extrinsic evidence should not be adduced to interpret a settlement. As to a settlement agreement specifying an amount of back pay to be received by the appellant but not specifying what deductions the agency might set off against that amount, <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 45 MSPR 580, 585-86 (1990), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the settlement agreement is silent as to the issue of unemployment compensation, but that parol evidence indicates that the parties discussed this matter and intended that unemployment compensation would not be deducted from the back pay award. A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties, the interpretation of which is a question of law.... In construing a settlement agreement, the Board looks first to the terms of the agreement itself in order to determine the intent of the parties at the time that they entered into the contract.... The Board will consider parol evidence only if the agreement is ambiguous. Silence in a contract, however, does not necessarily create an ambiguity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Richen-Gemco, Inc. v. Heltra, Inc.</span>, 540 F.2d 1235, 1239 (4th Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, there is no ambiguity present in the settlement agreement. The parties agreed that the appellant would receive $4,500 in back pay with adjustments made to that sum as required by the regulations governing back pay. The mere fact that the agreement is silent as to unemployment compensation does not create an ambiguity requiring the Board to consider parol evidence. Further, at the end of the hearing at which the settlement was read into the record, the appellant's representative stated that he was satisfied with the terms of the settlement agreement....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Evidence will be taken if a term, e.g., the date of reinstatement, is implicitly an element but is not included in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 125, 128 (1992). The decision following remand, <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 673, 676-79 (1993), determined it was appropriate to examine the parties' conduct after the settlement to determine what they meant in the settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The sole issue before us is the meaning of the term "reinstate," as the parties used that term in paragraph 2a of the settlement agreement. As we indicated in our previous decision, consideration of parol evidence in resolving this issue is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDavid</span>, 54 MSPR at 128; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Romano v. United States Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 319, 323 (1991) (a contract is said to be ambiguous when it is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation); <span class="Italic">Miura v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 663, 668 (1989) (if the terms of the agreement are ambiguous, parol evidence may be admitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge stated in the remand compliance initial decision that the use of the term "reinstatement" in the settlement agreement, instead of "language that the removal would be cancelled or the action rescinded," supported the agency's position regarding the effective date. This statement appears to indicate that the administrative judge believed the term at issue here generally was not used in referring to restorations retroactive to the effective dates of removals. He cited no authority in support of that view, however. Furthermore, even if the term usually has the connotation suggested by the administrative judge, we note that the meaning of a term used in a settlement agreement is the meaning the parties intended it to convey<span class="Italic">. See</span> 17A C.J.S. 300 Contracts (1963).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that he was told by the agency that, if he were reinstated under the agreement, "it would be 'as though [he] were never terminated' and 'as though [he] had never left [his] desk.'" The only support for this allegation that is properly before the Board, however, consists of the appellant's counsel's assertions [on] behalf of the appellant. In the absence of any indication that the appellant's counsel had any personal knowledge of the agency's alleged statements to the appellant, his assertions do not constitute evidence that the statements were made....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that a second settlement agreement, into which he and the agency entered in an unsuccessful attempt to resolve their differences regarding the agreement at issue here, indicates that the parties intended that his reinstatement would be retroactive to the date of his removal.[6] We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Board set this second agreement aside after finding that one of its material provisions was unlawful and that the parties had been mutually mistaken regarding its unlawfulness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 108, 111 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that the parties' conduct after they have entered into a settlement agreement may be relevant to an interpretation of terms in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Laborers Health &#x0026; Welfare Trust Fund for Northern California v. Kaufman &#x0026; Broad of Northern California</span>, 707 F.2d 412, 418 (9th Cir. 1983) (in determining the intent of parties to a contract whose meaning is not clear on its face, the trier of fact may consider the parties' conduct subsequent to contract formation); <span class="Italic">see also Noell v. American Design, Inc., Profit Sharing Plan</span>, 764 F.2d 827, 832 (11th Cir. 1985), quoting <span class="Italic">Flagg-Utica Corp. v. City of Florence</span>, 275 Ala. 475 (1963) ("[d]ealings of parties subsequent to the written contract are important as going to show construction by parties themselves while friendly"); <span class="Italic">Lex Tex Ltd. v. Avtex Fibers, Inc. (In re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation)</span>, 462 F. Supp. 340, 342 (S.D. Fla. 1978), quoting <span class="Italic">Brown v. Financial Service Corp., International</span>, 489 F.2d 144, 151 (5th Cir. 1974) (an "established rule of contract interpretation...is that courts may look to subsequent action of the parties to determine the interpretation that they themselves placed on the contractual language").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the second agreement, like the first, provided for the appellant's reinstatement without defining the term "reinstated." It also included a separate paragraph related to deductions that the agency was to make from the appellant's salary. In that paragraph, the parties agreed that the appellant would "drop his health plan and life insurance retroactive to July 23, 1987, and...that no health plan or life insurance deductions [would] be offset (not deducted from gross pay)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the provision quoted above nor any other provision in the second agreement specifically identified the date on which the appellant was to be reinstated. The statement that the appellant's health benefits plan and life insurance were to be cancelled retroactive to the date of his removal, however, along with the statement that payments for those purposes were not to be deducted from the appellant's pay, indicates that the parties contemplated that the appellant's reinstatement would entitle him to receive back pay dating back to his removal. Furthermore, we see nothing in the agreement indicating any basis for payment of this back pay other than the provision that the appellant would be "reinstated to his former position." We therefore find that the parties intended, when they entered into the second settlement agreement, that the term "reinstated" would mean the appellant's restoration to his position retroactive to the effective date of his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that both agreements concern the same general subject matter--i.e., the appellant's entitlement to be put back in his former position pursuant to a USAAMC determination. Evidence regarding the meaning of the term "reinstated" in the second agreement therefore would appear to be highly relevant to the interpretation of the term "reinstate" in the first agreement.... In addition, there is no indication that the parties intended, in entering into the second agreement, to modify their interpretation of the term "reinstate." In fact, there is no indication in the record that the parties were aware that any disagreement regarding the effective date of the appellant's reinstatement would arise. Instead, the purpose of the second agreement was to resolve a dispute over whether the appellant was entitled to be reinstated under the first agreement.</p>
