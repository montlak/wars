<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(b)(8), precludes the taking of or failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee because of</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(A)&#x2003;any disclosure of information by an employee...which the employee...reasonably believes evidences--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)&#x2003;any disclosure to the Special Counsel, or to the Inspector General of an agency or another employee designated by the head of the agency to receive such disclosures, of information which the employee...reasonably believes evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;any violation (other than a violation of this section) of any law, rule, or regulation, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(ii)&#x2003;gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This subsection shall not be construed to authorize the withholding of information from Congress or the taking of any personnel action against an employee who discloses information to Congress....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3705"></span>If the disclosure is prohibited by law or required to be kept secret by executive order, it can be made directly to OSC, to the agency IG, or to an employee designated by the agency head to receive those disclosures. 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kent v. GSA</span>, 56 MSPR 536 (1993), considered disclosures contrary to law. The decision explained the procedures available to an individual with information that, although constituting evidence of waste or mismanagement, cannot be disclosed due to a statutory restraint on its dissemination. In <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, the appellant was demoted from his position of communications management specialist following disclosure of sensitive pre-award procurement information. The appellant was assigned to serve on a three-member evaluation panel to assess responses to the agency's Requests for Proposals for a Technical Assistance and Management Services (TAMS) contract involving $41 million of expenses associated with a Federal Communications System 2000 procurement. As a member of the panel, chaired by the appellant's supervisor, the appellant received a copy of a draft initial technical evaluation report prepared by the supervisor. The agency characterized the contents of the report as "sensitive pre-award procurement information." The AJ concluded that the appellant violated agency policy and procedures by providing a copy of the report to a telecommunications consultant who was not authorized to receive the information. The appellant believed that his supervisor was biased toward one of the offerors on the TAMS contract, and because of the consultant's expertise, the appellant disclosed the evaluation report to obtain his opinion on whether the report demonstrated that bias.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kent</span> determined that the agency could properly discipline the appellant for improper disclosure of information made confidential by operation of statute (as opposed to confidentiality imposed by rule or regulation) and that the WPA provided no defense because the manner of the disclosure was unprotected by the Act, 56 MSPR at 541-48:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We agree that, in these circumstances, this disclosure comes within the protection of section 2302(b)(8) so long as the appellant establishes that his disclosure was based on a reasonable belief of government wrongdoing and was not "specifically prohibited by law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, the administrative judge found that the Federal Acquisition Regulation did not have the force and effect of law and thus did not deprive the appellant's disclosure from the protection of section 2302(b)(8). In its petition for review...the agency argues that: FAR is a Government-wide system of procurement rules that are legislative in nature under the agency's specific delegation of authority by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, Pub. L. No. 152, 63 Stat. 377, <span class="Italic">codified</span> at 40 USC 486; even without specific statutory authorization, procurement regulations may have the force and effect of law; and the administrative judge erred in relying upon the legislative history in light of the plain meaning of "law" and, in any event, the legislative history supports its interpretation of giving statutory effect to agency regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree that substantive agency regulations may have the force and effect of law in other contexts, we find that the statutory language, coupled with the legislative history of the CSRA, subsequently amended by the WPA, evidences a clear legislative intent to limit the term "specifically prohibited by law" in section 2302(b)(8) to statutes and court interpretations of those statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The phrase "specifically prohibited by law" follows other statutory language referring to "a violation of any law, rule, or regulation," thereby indicating that the term "law" was not intended to encompass rules or regulations. The statutory language provides that the only other exception to the protection afforded to these disclosures is where "such information is not specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs." Finally, we find that Congress' concern with internal agency rules and regulations impeding the disclosure of government wrongdoing, <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code &#x0026; Admin. News 2723, 2743, is consistent with this restrictive reading of the statutory language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, the legislative history of section 2302(b)(8), as originally enacted, indicates that "prohibited by law" refers to "statutory law and court interpretations of those statutes...not...to agency rules and regulations." H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 130, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2860, 2864. The 1989 amendments to this provision did not expand the scope of this statutory language to cover agency rules and regulations. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion in this case that there was no showing that FAR is a law specifically prohibiting disclosure under 5 USC 2302(b)(8) and 5 CFR 1209.5(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Trade Secrets Act provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent <span class="Italic">not authorized by law</span> any information coming to him in the course of his employment or official duties...which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association...shall be fined no more than $1000, or imprisoned not more than one year or both; and shall be removed from office or employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">18 USC 1905 (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge found that the Trade Secrets Act did not prohibit the appellant's disclosure of the confidential evaluation report to the private consultant. In reaching this conclusion, he observed that section 1905 was a statute of "general applicability" which did not "specifically" prohibit disclosure of the kind of information disclosed in this case, citing <span class="Italic">National Parks and Conservation Association v. Kleppe</span>, 547 F.2d 673, 686 (D.C. Cir. 1976). He further found that section 1905 only prohibits a disclosure "not authorized by law," while 5 USC 2302(b)(8) authorizes and encourages disclosures of information which the employee reasonably believes evidences government wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree that the fundamental purpose of section 2302(b)(8) is to encourage such disclosures, it expressly does not authorize disclosure of confidential information to unauthorized persons, where such disclosure is "specifically prohibited by law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the statutory scheme, 2302(b)(8) affords protection from a personnel action taken for disclosure of such confidential information only where it is made to the Special Counsel, the Inspector General, or a designated agency contact.[9] <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(B). Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that 5 USC 2302(b)(8) authorizes the disclosure of such confidential information to anyone and that the Trade Secrets Act therefore did not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;As noted below, the legislative history of section 2302(b)(8) indicates that disclosure to an appropriate unit of Congress is also protected. <span class="Italic">See</span> note 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that <span class="Italic">National Parks and Conservation Association v. Kleppe</span> does not preclude the applicability of the Trade Secrets Act as a limitation on the protection afforded under section 2302(b)(8). In <span class="Italic">Kleppe</span>, 547 F.2d at 686, the court held that section 1905 is "a statute of general applicability and not one that specifically defines or categorizes the information to be covered within the third exemption [of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), codified in 5 USC 552(b)(3)]." Although the FOIA seeks primarily to promote public disclosure of information collected by government officials, it recognizes specific public and private interests that are set forth in 5 USC 552(b) as exemptions to its disclosure requirements." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. Lauer</span>, 686 F.2d 24, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (citing <span class="Italic">Chrysler v. Brown</span>, 441 U.S. at 292, 99 S. Ct. at 1712).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases involving the third exemption, including <span class="Italic">Kleppe</span>, have therefore refused to incorporate the Trade Secrets Act into the third exemption, finding that Congress amended 5 USC 552(b)(3) to remove section 1905 as a basis for non-disclosure under that exemption, but that it remains operative under the fourth FOIA exemption--trade secrets and commercial or financial information--thus prohibiting an agency from revealing such information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">CNA Financial Corp. v. Donovan</span>, 830 F.2d 1132, 1144-52 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Kleppe</span>, 547 F.2d at 686-87. In <span class="Italic">Donovan</span>, the court further held that the FOIA can provide "the requisite legal authorization to disclose agency-gathered commercial and financial data" to the extent that such data "do not fall within one of the FOIA exemptions, particularly Exemption 4 or 6." 830 F.2d at 1142.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Trade Secrets Act does apply to section 2302(b)(8). We find that the statutory term "specifically prohibited by law" contained in 5 USC 2302(b)(8) is unclear and ambiguous, thereby compelling resort to legislative history in order to construe the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration v. Robertson</span>, 422 U.S. 255, 262-63, 95 S. Ct. 2140, 2146, 45 L. Ed.2d 164 (1975) (the former statutory language of the FOIA at 5 USC 552(b)(3), "specifically exempted from disclosure by statute," was ambiguous because it "contain[ed] no 'built-in' standard as in the case of some of the other exemptions"). We also find that, unlike the legislative history of 5 USC 552(b)(3), the legislative history of 5 USC 2302 demonstrates that section 1905 was deemed to be a law that specifically prohibited disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1717 at 132, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code &#x0026; Admin. News 2860, 2865.[14]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;The House Conference Report states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The conference substitute in 2302 adopts the Senate provision. The provision is intended to make clear that by placing limitation on the kinds of information any employee may publicly disclose without suffering reprisal, there is no intent to limit the information an employee may provide to Congress or to authorize reprisal against an employee for providing information to Congress. <span class="Italic">For example, 18 USC 1905 prohibits public disclosure of information involving trade secrets</span>. That statute does not apply to transmittal of such information by an agency to Congress. <span class="Italic">Section 2302(b)(8) of this act <span id="Page_3706"></span>would not protect an employee against reprisal for such statutorily protected information</span>, but it is not inferred that an employee is similarly unprotected if such disclosure is made to the appropriate unit of Congress. Neither title I nor any other provision of the act should be construed as limiting in any way the rights of employees to communicate with or testify before Congress....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore hold that section 2302(b)(8) does not protect the disclosure of highly confidential information to unauthorized persons where such disclosure is specifically prohibited by section 1905.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1905 prohibits disclosure to an unauthorized person of confidential information relating to the "processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus" as well as to the "identity" of any person or other legal entity. As we discuss above, the draft August 7, 1987 report disclosed by the appellant identified the offerers to the agency's RFP and evaluated their responses for the TAMS contract in light of a variety of factors, including the processes for designing solutions, the skill and number of personnel assigned to the technical tasks, the confirmed availability of staff, organizational development, and adequacy of internal quality review of work activities. In discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the responses, as well as assigning a numerical score based on such factors, the report further described the "processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus" of each offerer. We therefore find that the appellant's disclosure of this confidential report to a consultant who was not authorized to receive this information violated section 1905.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that there is no basis for concluding that the appellant's disclosure was exempted from section 1905 since it was not made "in any manner or to any extent authorized by law." As we discuss above, the WPA does not independently give an individual the authority to reveal confidential information to an unauthorized person, but such information must be disclosed to the Special Counsel, the agency's Inspector General, or any other designated agency official. While the FOIA sets forth procedures for the disclosure of certain information, this disclosure was not made pursuant to a FOIA request. We therefore conclude that the agency is not required to make the same confidentiality showing that would be required for an exemption to be shown under 5 USC 552(b)(4), including the likelihood of substantial competitive injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Wallington</span>, 889 F.2d 573, 579-80 (5th Cir. 1989) ("confidential" under section 1905 requires that the agency have at least an official policy that the information not be disclosed or that non-disclosure be mandated by statute or regulation); <span class="Italic">CNA Financial Corp. v. Donovan</span>, 830 F.2d at 1152 &#x0026; n.143 (information is "confidential" under exemption 4 of the FOIA if it is likely to cause substantial harm to a person from whom the information was obtained).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, we find that such substantial harm has been shown here, especially where, because of the timing and manner of the appellant's disclosure, the sensitive pre-award commercial information was likely to substantially and unfairly benefit an individual offeror to the disadvantage of the competitive positions of the other offerors. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 912 F.2d 1448, 1554-55 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (disclosure of official government information, "not made available to the general public," ranking the relative technical capabilities of companies being considered for a government contract to a potential subcontractor at a private meeting violated agency regulations prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that the appellant's disclosure was not protected by the WPA. We further find that the appellant's false statement to the OIG on August 31, 1988, when he denied providing the report to the consultant, did not constitute "privileged communications," as found by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency's charges must be sustained and that they warrant disciplinary action.... <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 41 MSPR 363, 365-368 (1989) (removal was reasonable for sustained charges of divulging confidential information to a subcontractor and accepting a gratuitous lunch, despite absence of personal gain or attempt to influence award, and the appellant's past exemplary service of over 28 years with no disciplinary record), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 912 F.2d 1448 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>

The Board determined in <span class="Italic">MacLean</span> that the term "law" also embraced agency regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A), provides, in pertinent part, the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority...(8) take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of--(A) any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, <span class="Italic">if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that a disclosure of information that is SSI, except to "persons with a need to know," is prohibited by statute and regulation, and as such, the appellant cannot seek the protection of the WPA to cover his alleged misconduct. The appellant contends that only agency regulations prohibit disclosure of information that is SSI, and that the Board has interpreted the exclusion from whistleblower protection for disclosures that are "prohibited by law or Executive Order" to apply only to those disclosures not allowed by "statutes and court interpretations of statutes."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) excludes from coverage disclosures "specifically prohibited by law" or Executive order. The agency does not argue that any Executive order prohibited disclosure of the information the appellant allegedly disclosed. The question then is whether any "law" prohibited the alleged disclosure. The Board has held that "prohibited by law," as that term is used in section 2302(b)(8), means prohibited by statutory law as opposed to regulation. <span class="Italic">Kent v. General Services Administration</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 536 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Kent,</span> the Board addressed the question of whether the General Services Administration (GSA) regulations fell within the parameters of the "prohibited by law" language set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). The Board ruled that regulations promulgated by a federal agency do not fall within the term "law" as it is used in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), as amended by the WPA, after reviewing the construction of the statute and the legislative history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Congress required in the ATSA that the agency "prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security...if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing the information would...be detrimental to the security of transportation." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s)(1)(C). For the reasons set forth below, we find that disclosures that are prohibited by the regulations promulgated pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s) are "prohibited by law" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for the Board's analysis of the "prohibited by law" language is <span class="Italic">Chrysler Corp. v. Brown</span>, 441 U.S. 281 (1979). In <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span>, the Court undertook the analogous task of interpreting a statute that contained a special exception for activities "authorized by law." In considering whether an agency regulation that authorized the activity satisfied the condition, the Court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It has been established in a variety of contexts that properly promulgated, substantive agency regulations have the force and effect of law. This doctrine is so well established that agency regulations implementing federal statutes have been held to pre-empt state law under the Supremacy Clause. It would therefore take a clear showing of contrary legislative intent before the phrase "authorized by law" in [the statutory section at issue] could be held to have a narrower ambit than the traditional understanding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">441 U.S. at 295-96.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> thus sets up a default rule, and a specific exception. That is, agency regulations that are (1) properly promulgated, and (2) substantive, must be accorded the force and effect of law absent a clear showing of contrary legislative intent. With regard to the substantive characteristics and procedural requisites, the <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> court elaborated three conditions for a rule to have the force and effect of law. These are (1) it must be a "substantive rule"; (2) Congress must have granted the agency authority to create such a regulation; and (3) the regulations must be promulgated in conformity with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress. 441 U.S. at 301-03; <span class="Italic">see also Hamlet v. United States</span>, 63 F.3d 1097, 1105 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (distilling the three conditions from <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, these three conditions are present for initial application of the default rule to 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7 (2003). A substantive rule is a "legislative-type rule" that "affect[s] individual rights and obligations." <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span>, 441 U.S. at 302. Title 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7 certainly affects individual rights and obligations, by expressly limiting the speech rights of possessors of information defined by the regulation as SSI. It is also clear that 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s) expressly granted the Under Secretary the authority to promulgate the regulations, which "prohibit[] the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security...if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing the information would...be detrimental to the security of transportation." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s). Finally, the regulations at 49 C.F.R. part <span id="Page_3707"></span>1520 were properly promulgated under the Administrative Procedure Act rules governing legislative rulemaking--notice was published, comments were received, an interim final rule soliciting further comments was published, and a final rule was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, "absent a clear showing of contrary legislative intent" the phrase "prohibited by law" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) must be read to include disclosures prohibited by 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7 (2003). In <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, the Board examined the language and legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) and discovered "a clear legislative intent to limit the term 'specifically prohibited by law'...to statutes and court interpretations of statutes." 56 M.S.P.R. at 542.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the statutory language, the Board concluded that inclusion of the phrase "specifically prohibited by law" following other statutory language referring to "a violation of any law, rule, or regulation," "indicated that the term 'law' was not intended to encompass rules and regulations." 56 M.S.P.R. at 542. We do not find that this distinction evidences a clear showing of legislative intent. The differing grammatical structures of the phrases are not compatible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, drawing a distinction between the phrases "of any law, rule, or regulation" and "by law" based simply on the latter's failure to include "rule, or regulation" begs the question at issue: whether the default construction of "by law" to include regulations has been overcome by clear legislative intent. Given the traditional default rule, Congress would have no reason to use the broader (and redundant) phrase "by law, rule, or regulation" when "by law" suffices. Moreover, the phrase "by law" has been in legislative use since at least the mid-19th century. <span class="Italic">See Chrysler</span>, 441 U.S. at 296-98 (discussing antecedents to the Trade Secrets Act of 1947, which, since the Revenue Act of 1864, included language prohibiting disclosures except as "provided by law" or "authorized by law"). As the <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> court explained, the language has been "well-established" to encompass properly promulgated substantive agency regulations. Congress must be presumed to have been aware of these antecedents and their construction when it opted to use the phrase "by law" in the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Kent</span> also relied upon legislative history to support its conclusion that disclosures prohibited by regulation are not prohibited "by law" under the CSRA. The Board opined that "Congress' concern with internal agency rules and regulations impeding the disclosure of government wrongdoing is consistent with this restrictive reading of the statutory language." 56 M.S.P.R. at 542 (citing S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2743). The Board also cited a passage from the House Conference Report explaining that "prohibited by law" refers to "statutory law and court interpretations of those statutes...not...to agency rules and regulations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 542-43 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 130, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2860, 2864).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A closer examination of the legislative history indicates that Congress' intent is at best ambiguous, and therefore does not meet the standard of clarity required by <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span>. The original version of the bill as introduced in both the House and the Senate protected disclosures that were "not prohibited by law, rule, or regulation." H.R. 11280 and S. 2640. The Senate version was amended by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs to substitute the phrase "not prohibited by statute." S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2730, 2743. The House version was amended by the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service to substitute the phrase "not prohibited by law." The full House and Senate each passed their respective versions of the bill, both as S. 2640. In conference, the House language "not prohibited by law" was selected in lieu of the Senate language "not prohibited by statute." H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 130, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2860, 2864. The selection of the broader phrase "by law" evidences Congressional intent to expand the scope of the exemption beyond mere statutes to include all "law." Under the general rules of statutory construction, Congress can be presumed to have known that its selection of the broader phrase "by law," in the absence of any limiting language, could expand the scope of the exemption to include all "law." <span class="Italic">See D'Elia v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 226, 232 (1993), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds, Thomas v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 224 (1998), <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds by Ganski v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the legislative history also shows that even the Senate's adoption of the narrower phrase "by statute" was not intended to exclude substantive regulations mandated by Congress, such as those promulgated pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s). The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs modified the original bill to limit the exemption to disclosures prohibited "by statute," out of "concern that the limitation of protection in S. 2640 to those disclosures 'not prohibited by law, rule, or regulation,' would encourage the adoption of <span class="Italic">internal procedural regulations against disclosure,</span> and thereby enable an agency to discourage an employee from coming forward with allegations of wrongdoing." S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2743-44 (emphasis added). "Rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice" are recognized as distinct from the "substantive rules" that are authorized by Congress and can have the force of law. <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span>, 441 U.S. at 301. Thus, by expressly excluding "internal procedural regulations," the Senate Committee implicitly included substantive agency regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The House Conference Report explanation that "prohibited by law" refers to "statutory law and court interpretations of those statutes...not...to agency rules and regulations," could be construed in isolation to suggest an intent to the contrary to protect disclosures prohibited by a substantive regulation. However, in light of the contrary indicia of Congressional intent, this language alone cannot establish the "<span class="Italic">clear showing</span> of contrary legislative intent" required before the phrase "prohibited by law" "could be held to have a narrower ambit than the traditional understanding." 441 U.S. at 295-96. And there is, in fact, no other evidence in the Congressional record to establish that the language was intended to convey such intent. Indeed, the House Report is silent with regard to its substitution of "by law" for the "by law, rule, or regulation" language of the bill as originally introduced. House Report No. 95-1403 at 17 (referring only generally to the specific prohibited personnel practices enumerated at new section 2302(b)(2)-(11)), <span class="Italic">reprinted in Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978,</span> Committee on Post Office and Civil Services, Committee Print No. 96-2 (1979). Furthermore, the minutes of the Conference Committee sessions from which the enacted version of the bill emerged, reflect that the selection of the House's "by law" over the Senate's "by statute" was not even discussed by the Committee members.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the AJ in this case did not undertake a detailed <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> analysis, his rationale for distinguishing <span class="Italic">Kent</span> was based upon the standards addressed in <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span>. He observed that the statute under which the regulation at issue in <span class="Italic">Kent</span> was promulgated did not "require [the agency] to include in its regulations categories of information that may not be disclosed to a third party, as the GSA alleged Mr. Kent did in a charge underlying its action against him. Therefore, at most, Mr. Kent's disclosure(s) violated the regulations, but not the law that mandated them." Certification Order at 9. The same point made under the <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> framework would be that one of the three prerequisites to giving the regulation the effect of law was not satisfied because Congress did not grant the GSA authority to promulgate a regulation that prohibited the disclosure of information. In other words, the Board in <span class="Italic">Kent</span> went too far by holding that a regulation could <span class="Italic">never</span> be a law prohibiting disclosure within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 (b)(8). The same outcome could have been reached by holding simply that the GSA regulation at issue was not entitled to the force and effect of law under the governing standards.[2] In contrast, those standards mandate that 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7 (2003) be given the force and effect of law in the context of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). Based upon the foregoing, we find that a disclosure in violation of the regulations governing SSI, which were promulgated pursuant to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s), is "prohibited by law" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) and thus cannot give rise to whistleblower protection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Thus, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Kent v. General Services Administration</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 536 (1993), holds that a regulation could never be a law prohibiting disclosure within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A), we modify it.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Except where specified otherwise, the following facts are not in dispute. Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the appellant was appointed to the position of Civil Aviation Security Specialist, also known as Federal Air Marshal (FAM). He was originally employed in the Department of Transportation, specifically the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). He was transferred to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) when that agency was created in late 2001 for the purpose of promoting aviation security, among other things. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597, &#x00A7; 101. In early 2003 the appellant became an employee of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) when TSA's workforce and functions were transferred to DHS. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, 2178, &#x00A7; 403.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In July 2003, the appellant received a briefing from TSA concerning a "potential plot" to hijack U.S. airliners. Soon after the briefing, TSA officials sent a directive to FAMs that all Remain Overnight (RON) missions in early August would be cancelled. At the time of the directive, the pertinent regulations prohibited disclosure of Sensitive Security Information (SSI) to the public. 67 Fed. Reg. 8340, 8351 (2002) (promulgating 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; <span id="Page_3708"></span>1520.3 &#x0026; 1520.5 as a Final Rule). Under the definition in effect at the time of the directive, SSI consisted of, among other things, "[s]pecific details of aviation security measures," including but not limited to "information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments, or missions." 67 Fed. Reg. 8340, 8352 (2002) (promulgating 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7). In July 2003, each FAM was equipped with a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) on which he could receive encrypted messages from TSA. The appellant received the directive cancelling RONs as an unencrypted text message on his cell phone, however. The message was not labeled as SSI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant believed that the suspension of overnight missions during a hijacking alert created a danger to the flying public and was inconsistent with what "the law mandated." He raised his concerns with his supervisor and with an employee in the agency's Inspector General's office but was not satisfied with the responses he received. The appellant then revealed the contents of the RON directive to a reporter from MSNBC, with the hope that the reporter could create a controversy resulting in rescission of the directive. On Tuesday, July 29, 2003, MSNBC published an article on its website entitled "Air Marshals Pulled from Key Flights." The article stated that "[d]espite renewed warnings about possible airline hijackings, the Transportation Security Administration has alerted federal air marshals that as of Friday they will no longer be covering cross-country or international flights, MSNBC.com has learned." The appellant was not identified in the article. Members of Congress criticized TSA's suspension of overnight missions, and the directive was withdrawn before it went into effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After this series of events, the appellant came to believe that FAMs should speak with "a collective voice," so he became active in the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA). About a year later, the appellant appeared on NBC Nightly News, in disguise and identified as Air Marshal "Mike," when he asserted that the agency's dress code allowed would-be terrorists to identify FAMs. Someone from TSA recognized his voice, and TSA ordered an investigation into the appellant's "unauthorized media appearance." During the investigation, the appellant admitted that he was the one who told the press about the 2003 suspension of overnight missions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency proposed the appellant's removal on charges of: (1) Unauthorized Media Appearance; (2) Unauthorized Release of Information to the Media; and (3) Unauthorized Disclosure of Sensitive Security Information. The deciding official, Special Agent in Charge Frank Donzati, sustained only the third charge and imposed removal. Subsequently, TSA issued an August 31, 2006 order finding that the 2003 directive regarding overnight missions was SSI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, and following a dismissal without prejudice to allow the appellant to contest the agency's August 31, 2006 order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the administrative judge certified several rulings for interlocutory review, In the resulting decision, the Board held as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--The Board lacks the authority to determine for itself whether the particular information the appellant disclosed in 2003 was SSI. The appellant obtained a dismissal without prejudice for the purpose of instituting an action in federal court seeking a declaration that the information he disclosed was not SSI. The court found that the information he disclosed was SSI.[2] The Board and the parties are bound by the result of that litigation, regardless of the fact that the agency did not expressly deem the 2003 instruction to be SSI until after it removed the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[2] The Court also determined that the TSA order did not constitute an improper, retroactive agency adjudication, but that "the agency applied regulations that were in force in 2003 to determine that information created in 2003 was [SSI]." <span class="Italic">MacLean v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 543 F.3d 1145, 1152 (9th Cir. 2008). <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--The appellant's disclosure of SSI to the media cannot constitute protected whistleblowing because the appellant violated agency regulations when he made the disclosure. The decision in<span class="Italic"> Kent v. General Services Administration,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 536 (1993)--where the Board had held that the exception to whistleblower coverage for disclosures "specifically prohibited by law," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A), applies only to disclosures prohibited by statute--was modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">MacLean v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 4 (2009) (<span class="Italic">MacLean I</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon return of the case to the regional office, the administrative judge held a hearing and issued an initial decision upholding the appellant's removal. The administrative judge first explained at length why he found not credible the appellant's testimony that he did not think the 2003 directive was SSI when he disclosed it to the reporter. The administrative judge then sustained the charge of unauthorized disclosure of SSI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found unproven the appellant's affirmative defense that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10), which prohibits discrimination because of "conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others."[3] According to the appellant, the agency targeted him because he became active in FLEOA, and his removal for unauthorized disclosure of SSI was a pretext. The administrative judge weighed the evidence and concluded that this claim was unproven. Turning to the appellant's First Amendment claim, the administrative judge found that the appellant's 2003 disclosure to MSNBC addressed a matter of public concern, but that the appellant's right to speak was outweighed by the agency's need to control dissemination of information about aviation security measures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant concedes that, as a FAM, he was not covered by the federal labor-relations statute at 5 U.S.C. ch. 71, and thus his activity was not protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge found that the penalty was reasonable. In doing so, he concluded that deciding official Donzanti properly considered the relevant factors under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). The administrative judge specifically found that, among other things, Donzanti considered that the appellant's disclosure of SSI was serious because it created a "vulnerability" as soon as the appellant made the disclosure. The administrative judge further found that the offense was intentional, i.e., the appellant intentionally made a statement including the SSI to a reporter and he was on clear notice that the information should not be publicly revealed. He noted the appellant's sworn statement that he had no regrets and felt no remorse for going to the media, and his sworn deposition testimony that it did not matter to him whether or not the information conveyed to the reporter was SSI. The administrative judge also distinguished the comparison employees identified by the appellant purporting to evidence inconsistency of penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Administrative Judge Correctly Sustained the Charge</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant based on the charge of "Unauthorized Disclosure of Sensitive Security Information." In support of the charge, the agency specified as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On July 29, 2003, you disclosed Sensitive Security Information in an unauthorized manner. Specifically, you informed the media that all Las Vegas FAMs were sent a text message to their government issued mobile phones that all RON (Remain Overnight) missions up August 9th would be cancelled, or words to that effect. You admitted and acknowledged the foregoing during an official, administrative inquiry regarding your conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The media person to whom you disclosed this information is not a covered person within the meaning of the SSI regulations, 49 C.F.R. Part 1520. The information you improperly disclosed concerned RON deployments. Such information is protected as SSI pursuant to 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.5(b)(8)(ii)[,] which safeguards "Information concerning the deployments, numbers and operations of...Federal Air Marshals..." The disclosure of this SSI had the potential to reveal vulnerabilities in the aviation security system, and as such, was extremely dangerous to the public we serve.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in sustaining the charge without making a finding whether he had a "good faith belief" that he was permitted to disclose the contents of the text message to the reporter. The appellant also argues at length that the administrative judge was wrong to reject, as not credible, his testimony that he did not know the text message was SSI. The agency argues that intent is not an element of the charge. We agree with the agency. The charge, as titled and as described in the specification, did not contain a specific intent element; the agency did not allege in its charge that the appellant engaged in intentional misconduct. Some charges, such as falsification, by their very nature require a showing of intent. <span class="Italic">See Naekel v. Department of Transportation,</span> 782 F.2d 975, 978 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Baracker v. Department of the Interior,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 594, 599 (1996). Because the agency in this case did not bring such a charge, the Board may sustain the charge without a showing of intentionality, willfulness, knowingness, or the like, as long as imposing discipline for the conduct promotes the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a); <span class="Italic">see Fernandez v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2003); <span class="Italic">Cross v. Department of the Army,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the regulations in effect in July 2003, information relating to the deployment of FAMs was included within the definition of SSI. 67 Fed. Reg. 8352 (2002) (49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7(j)). The appellant was not authorized to release SSI to a reporter, 67 Fed. Reg. 8351 (49 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1520.1(a), 1520.3(a)-(b)), nor was the reporter someone with a "need to know" SSI, 67 Fed. Reg. 8352 (49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.5). Imposing discipline for the appellant's disclosure of the text message to a reporter promotes the efficiency of the service because maintaining confidentiality of plans <span id="Page_3709"></span>for FAM deployments goes to the heart of one of TSA's missions, that of promoting civil aviation safety and security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellant's Disclosure to the MSNBC Reporter Is Not Protected Whistleblowing Because It Was "Specifically Prohibited by Law."</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is a prohibited personnel practice for an agency to impose discipline because of an employee's disclosure of "information...which the employee...reasonably believes evidences--(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). In <span class="Italic">MacLean I,</span> the Board held that the appellant's disclosure of the 2003 directive concerning overnight missions to a reporter was not protected whistleblowing because it was "specifically prohibited by law." <span class="Italic">MacLean,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-33. The appellant argues that this holding was incorrect and asks that we overrule it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law of the case doctrine refers to the practice of courts in refusing to reopen what already has been decided in an appeal, and of following a prior decision in an appeal of the same case. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 552 (1993). These rules do not involve preclusion by final judgment, but instead regulate judicial affairs before final judgment. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 339 (1995). There are three recognized exceptions to the law of the case doctrine: The availability of new and substantially different evidence; a contrary decision of law by controlling authority that is applicable to the question at issue; or a showing that the prior decision in the same appeal was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice. <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Principi,</span> 260 F.3d 1357, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Peartree,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 337; <span class="Italic">Hoover,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. at 553. We decline the appellant's invitation to overrule the Board's 2009 decision because that decision was not "clearly erroneous," and he has not alleged any other bases for deviating from the law of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">MacLean I</span> could be read broadly to allow any regulation that meets certain conditions to be accorded the full force and effect of law, and thus, a disclosure in violation of such a regulation could be construed as "prohibited by law" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). We find that such a broad ruling is unnecessary to resolve the issues presented by this appeal and is inconsistent with the policies that Congress embodied in the Whistleblower Protection Act ("WPA"). We therefore modify <span class="Italic">MacLean I</span> to the extent it is inconsistent with the decision we issue today. Rather, we find that the appellant's disclosure of SSI was "specifically prohibited by law" because the regulation that he violated when he disclosed information about FAM deployments was promulgated pursuant to an explicit Congressional mandate that required TSA to prohibit such disclosures. Specifically, in enacting Pub. L. No. 103-272, &#x00A7; 101, 108 Stat. 745, 1117 (July 5, 1994), codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119,[7] Congress expressly required that TSA issue aviation-related regulations "prohibiting disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security" if, in the agency's view, "disclosing the information" would "be detrimental to the safety of passengers in air transportation." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119(b)(1)(C). <span class="Italic">Citing</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119 (among other authorities), on February 22, 2002, the Under Secretary of TSA[8] issued regulations on February 22, 2002, which identified SSI subject to this statutory nondisclosure as including information relating to FAM deployments. 67 Fed. Reg. 8340, 8351-52 (2002).[9] Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has unequivocally declared that the information disclosed by the appellant constituted SSI as defined in those regulations. <span class="Italic">See MacLean,</span> 543 F.3d at 1150.[10] Consequently, because the appellant disclosed information that is specifically prohibited from disclosure by a regulation promulgated pursuant to an express legislative directive from Congress to TSA,[11] we find that his disclosure was "specifically prohibited by law" so as to bring it outside the scope of the whistleblower protection provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The statute states in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;DISCLOSURE.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(1)&#x2003;Notwithstanding section 552 of title 5, the Administrator shall prescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security or research and development activities under section 44501(a) or (c), 44502(a)(1) or (3), (b), or (c), 44504, 44505, 44507, 44508, 44511, 44512, 44513, 44901, 44903(a), (b), (c), or (e), 44905, 44912, 44935, 44936, or 44938(a) or (b) of this title if the Administrator decides disclosing the information would--(A) be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (B) reveal a trade secret or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information; or (C) be detrimental to the safety of passengers in air transportation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(2)&#x2003;Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not authorize information to be withheld from a committee of Congress authorized to have the information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In 2001, Congress enacted the legislation creating the Transportation Security Administration, which was charged with carrying out certain functions previously performed by the Federal Aviation Administration. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597, 603 (Nov. 19, 2001). Section 101(e)(2) of that statute replaced the word "Administrator" [of the Federal Aviation Administration] in section 40119(b) with "Under Secretary," which refers to the Under Secretary of Transportation Security, <span class="Italic">see</span> 49 U.S. &#x00A7; 1154(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The Board's 2009 decision cited 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s) as the authority for the SSI regulations at 49 C.F.R. Part 1520. 112 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 10. However, section 114(s) (which was later redesignated as subsection (r), <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. L. No. 110-161, Div. E, &#x00A7; 568(a)), became law on November 25, 2002, see Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, 2312, and TSA did not issue regulations under that specific statutory authority until May 18, 2004, <span class="Italic">see</span> 69 Fed. Reg. 28066, 28082 (2004). Nevertheless, as explained above, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119 (which is substantively similar to section 114(s)) gave the Under Secretary for Transportation Security the authority to issue regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information if such disclosure would be "detrimental to the safety of passengers in air transportation," the Under Secretary issued such regulations in 2002, <span class="Italic">see</span> 67 Fed. Reg. 8340, 8351-52, and the appellant violated those regulations. The citation to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(s) instead of section 40119 in the Board's 2009 decision had no affect on the outcome.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Congress established judicial review of TSA final orders in the federal courts of appeals with exclusive review by the Supreme Court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 46110(a) and (e) ("A decision by a court under this section may be reviewed only by the Supreme Court under section 1254 of title 28.") Thus, this Board has no authority to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit holding that the information that the appellant disclosed constituted SSI because it "contained 'specific details of aviation security measures' regarding 'deployment and missions' of [FAMs]" in violation of 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7(i). <span class="Italic">MacLean</span>, 543 F.3d at 1150.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The Board has no authority to review either the statutory mandate against disclosure, or the legality of the regulation issued pursuant thereto. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We would share some of the concerns expressed by Representatives Kucinich and Maloney if <span class="Italic">MacLean I</span> were given the broad sweep that they address in their <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief. As we have explained above, however, we limit our holding here and the reach of <span class="Italic">MacLean I</span> in order to give effect to both the WPA and Congress's express intent to prohibit the public disclosure of aviation security information. The appellant's disclosure of FAM deployment information was not protected by the WPA because it was prohibited by SSI regulations issued by TSA in compliance with an express statutory requirement of Congress to issue regulations "prohibiting disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security" if, in TSA's view, "disclosing the information" would "be detrimental to the safety of passengers in air transportation." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119(b)(1)(C). To the extent that this statutory mandate encroaches upon the protections afforded by the WPA, it is for Congress, not the Board, to resolve the competing legislative objectives underlying these statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's disclosure of information relating to FAM deployments to an MSNBC reporter does not constitute protected whistleblowing activity, our holding today does not mean that TSA may rely on its SSI regulations as authority for prohibiting all disclosures relating to aviation security and safety. On the contrary, Congress has specified that the regulations issued pursuant to its mandate in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119 may not prohibit disclosures to "a committee of Congress authorized to have the information." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(r)(2). Additionally, we note that the "specifically prohibited by law" exclusion from WPA protection does not apply to disclosures made to the Office of Special Counsel. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(B); <span class="Italic">see Parikh v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 295. &#x00B6; 23 n.1 (2008). The appellant did not pursue either of these channels.[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;Because the appellant did not make his disclosure through either of the two authorized channels described above, we make no finding on whether, if he had, his disclosure would have been protected as evidencing a violation of law, rule, or regulation, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or some other condition described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the case of <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 602 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2010), while appearing to have some similarity to this case, is distinguishable. Ms. Chambers, like the appellant herein, publicly disclosed information about the deployment of law enforcement officers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1378. Ms. Chambers's disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1379, was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; <span id="Page_3710"></span>2302(b)(8)(A)(ii), however, because it was not "specifically prohibited by law." By contrast, while the appellant was also arguably disclosing a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, his disclosure cannot similarly be protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii) because it contained SSI, the disclosure of which was "specifically prohibited by law" under a regulatory nondisclosure scheme mandated by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellant's Removal Based on His 2003 SSI Disclosure Did Not Violate His First Amendment Right of Free Speech</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech by removing him for his 2003 disclosure of SSI to the MSNBC reporter. The administrative judge found the appellant's First Amendment claim unproven, finding that under the balancing test outlined in <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District 205, Will Count, Illinois,</span> 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968), the appellant's interest in commenting on a matter of public concern, i.e., the 2003 directive regarding overnight missions, was outweighed by the interest of the agency, as employer, in promoting aviation security. The appellant challenges this finding. We note, in this regard, courts have recognized that law enforcement duties entail special obligations with regard to public trust that may be considered in the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Aguilar,</span> 515 U.S. 593, 606 (1995); <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Barry,</span> 148 F.3d 1126, 1135 (D.C. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Cochran v. City of Los Angeles,</span> 222 F.3d 1195, 1201 (9th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</span> 230 F. Supp.2d 207, 225 (D. Mass. 2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 362 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Pierson v. Gondles,</span> 693 F. Supp. 408, 418 (E.D. Va. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record reflects that the appellant revealed information about FAM deployments that the agency legitimately expected to remain confidential, and which created a vulnerability in the aviation system. We find that disciplining the appellant for releasing details of aviation security measures to a reporter did not violate his First Amendment right of free speech. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chambers v. Department of the Interior,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 36-42 (2006) (disciplining a Chief of Police for disclosing information about officer patrols and her agency's budget to a reporter did not violate her First Amendment right of free speech), a<span class="Italic">ff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, and remanded,</span> 515 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also believe the fact that the agency acted in this instance pursuant to, and consistent with, the aforementioned statutory and regulatory nondisclosure scheme mandated by Congress regarding aviation security, undercuts the appellant's constitutional claim. To the extent that the appellant's claim implicitly involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute authorizing the agency to issue the nondisclosure regulations, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear such a claim. <span class="Italic">See May v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 534, 538 (1988) (the Board has authority to adjudicate a constitutional challenge to an agency's application of a statute, but it is without authority to determine the constitutionality of federal statutes).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellant Did Not Prove His Prohibited Personnel Practice Claim Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10)</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the appellant also contends that the agency retaliated against him because of his FLEOA activities, thereby committing a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10). The relevant statute pertinently provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(10)&#x2003;discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others;....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not previously established the precise elements for proving a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10). Depending on the specific facts and circumstances, the proscription of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) may be analogous to either (1) the prohibition against retaliation for exercising appeal rights, filing grievances, etc., found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), or to (2) a traditional claim of discrimination governed by the principles of Title VII. We find it unnecessary in this case, however, to decide the specific legal framework that the Board will apply to future &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) claims because the appellant has failed to prove his claim under either standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) applying the (b)(9) framework, the appellant must demonstrate that: (1) He engaged in activity that did not adversely affect his performance; (2) he was subsequently treated in an adverse fashion by the agency; (3) the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the appellant's (b)(10) activity; and (4) there is a causal connection between the (b)(10) activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Crump v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">Wildeman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 313, 320 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also Warren v. Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Where, as here, the agency has already articulated a non-retaliatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct, it has done everything that would be required of it if the appellant had made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Thus, our inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, weighing all the evidence, the appellant has met his burden of proving illegal retaliation. <span class="Italic">Crump,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">see U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 715 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If analyzed under the legal framework for traditional Title VII claims, in order to prevail the appellant had to show by preponderant evidence that he engaged in conduct that did not adversely affect his performance and that the agency intentionally discriminated against him for that conduct. In the absence of direct evidence of intentional discrimination, the appellant could meet this burden by introducing evidence giving rise to an inference of disparate treatment because of his conduct unrelated to his performance. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 7 (2010), <span class="Italic">citing McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). Assuming that he did so, the burden of production shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. If the agency meets this burden, the appellant then must prove that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for discrimination prohibited by (b)(10) and the activity unrelated to his performance was the real reason for the disparate treatment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In most adverse action appeals taken pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the agency has already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, i.e., the charged misconduct; accordingly, the agency has done everything that would be required of it if an appellant had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and whether he in fact did so is no longer relevant. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00B6; 9 n.3, <span class="Italic">citing Marshall v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 6 (2008). As a result, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met his overall burden of proving illegal discrimination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because either framework requires us to proceed to the ultimate question of whether the agency intentionally retaliated or discriminated against the appellant for his (b)(10) activities,[14] we have reviewed the record and we conclude that the appellant has failed to meet his burden to establish that the reason articulated by the agency for its decision to remove him was pretextual and that the real reason underlying that decision was his FLEOA activities. Even if we were to accept appellant's contentions that agency managers disapproved of his FLEOA activities, there is no direct evidence that the agency retaliated or discriminated against him for engaging in FLEOA activities when it removed him from employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;We assume, without deciding, that the agency would commit a prohibited personnel practice in violation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) if it removed the appellant in retaliation for his FLEOA activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no question that the appellant disclosed SSI in violation of agency regulations prohibiting such disclosure and that this was the agency's stated basis for his removal. The appellant contends, though, that he was treated more harshly than other similarly situated individuals who disclosed SSI and also that he and other FLEOA leaders were singled out for retaliatory treatment. While the record reflects that the agency treated other employees less harshly for their disclosures of SSI, the circumstances surrounding those disclosures are sufficiently distinct from the instant case as to undercut any inference that the reason for the difference is discrimination based on the appellant's FLEOA activities. For instance, the disclosures attributed to J.S. or J.M. were limited to a small number of individuals (to a few passengers on a plane under exigent circumstances and to some airline personnel for personal reasons, respectively). As for A.R., we note that, in the single specification of the unauthorized disclosure of SSI charge, the agency alleged that A.R. "posted a message on <a href="http://www.delphiforums.com/">www.delphiforums.com</a> that revealed security measures concerning the deployment of FAMS on international flights from the Atlanta Field Office." Unlike the appellant's disclosure, which created a vulnerability in aviation security by revealing to a national news reporter that FAMs were no longer going to be present on <span class="Italic">any</span> RON missions, A.R.'s disclosure appears to have been more limited because: it was disclosed on a single message board; it only identified FAM deployments out of the Atlanta Field Office; and it appeared to leave open the possibility that other offices would be responsible for those flights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's reliance on another individual, Frank Terreri, as similarly situated appears misplaced as the comparison actually undermines his claim that his FLEOA activities resulted in a harsher penalty. Mr. Terreri was the president of the air marshal chapter of FLEOA, engaged in outspoken criticism of agency management and its policies, and was investigated for releasing SSI. But he continues to be employed by TSA after the allegations made against him were deemed to be unfounded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant demonstrated a lack of regret for disclosing the RON information, <span id="Page_3711"></span>reflected, for example, in his deposition testimony to the effect that it did not matter to him if the information was confidential, law enforcement sensitive, SSI or classified information. The appellant also admitted during the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Due to the fact that my chain of command, the DHS OIG and my Congressmen all ignored my complaints and would not follow them up with investigations, I have NO REGRETS or feel NO REMORSE for going to a credible and responsible media representative, Brock Meeks. Brock Meeks reporting these gross mismanagement issues has resulted in immediate and positive change in deadly FAMS policies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the face of a clear Congressional directive for nondisclosure and a regulatory provision promulgated pursuant to that directive, which explicitly prohibits the type of public disclosure made by the appellant, the agency could and did reasonably infer a risk from the appellant's lack of remorse that he would continue to make disclosures that were prohibited by law. Thus, under the circumstances, we find that the appellant's lack of remorse to be a significant distinction justifying the agency's decision to remove him rather than imposing a lesser penalty. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. (the deciding official in A.R.'s case stated that he "plac[ed] a great deal of weight" on the fact that A.R. "demonstrated sincere remorse over this current incident" and "assured" the deciding official that he would "demonstrate the utmost diligence when handling SSI information.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the record as a whole, we find that the appellant has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency intentionally discriminated or retaliated against him on the basis of his FLEOA activities in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10).[15]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;To the extent the appellant contends that the agency violated his First Amendment rights based on his involvement with FLEOA, we find, for all of the reasons explained by the administrative judge and in our discussion of the appellant's &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10) claim, that the agency took its actions based on the charged misconduct and not for his association with or activities on behalf of the FLEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board Will Not Consider the Appellant's Claim Raised for the First Time on Petition for Review That the Agency Initiated Its Investigation in Retaliation for His Engaging in Protected Whistleblowing and First Amendment Speech</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time on petition for review, the appellant argues that his 2004 appearance on NBC Nightly News was protected free speech under the First Amendment and protected whistleblowing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and that the agency's investigation in response to his appearance was unlawful retaliation in violation of the First Amendment and the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the summary of the prehearing conference, the administrative judge stated as follows with respect to the appellant's affirmative defenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Here, the appellant alleges that the agency discriminated and retaliated against him based on his membership and leadership status with the FLEOA for other than merit reasons in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10); and that this discrimination and retaliation violated his First Amendment right of free association and his right to free speech. No other affirmative defenses are alleged in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge advised the parties that additional issues were precluded absent a timely meritorious objection. The appellant did not make any objection, and the issues he now attempts to raise were not mentioned in the summary of the prehearing conference. The general rule under such circumstances is that the issues raised for the first time on review will not be considered. <span class="Italic">See Henson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 10 (2009); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Justice,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 96, 101 n.4 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that we should make an exception to this general rule. He cites Board and federal appeals decisions for the principle that a new claim may be raised on review when the administrative judge confused or misled a party with respect to the claim, or when the party raising the claim has newly-discovered evidence. While we do not quarrel with the appellant's reading of the cases, the appellant makes no attempt to explain how the decisions he cites apply here. He does not allege, nor is there any evidence, that the administrative judge confused or misled him with respect to his claim regarding his 2004 appearance on NBC Nightly News. Rather, the appellant contends that by rejecting his FLEOA defense, in part, on the grounds of the appellant's own testimony that the 2004 television appearance was the catalyst for the agency's investigation, the administrative judge somehow "converted [his FLEOA defense] to a dispositive First Amendment violation" and "created a violation of the [WPA]." Even assuming the administrative judge found that the appellant's television appearance was the impetus for the investigation, we disagree with the appellant that this conclusion somehow "created" new claims that were not previously known to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the appellant does not allege that he only discovered that his appearance on NBC Nightly News spurred the investigation after the record closed below. In fact, the appellant testified before the administrative judge that his 2004 appearance on NBC Nightly News is what caused the agency to initiate the investigation in which he admitted revealing the 2003 RON directive to MSNBC. In other words, the appellant knew before the record closed below what caused the agency to begin its investigation. Thus, this is not a case in which a party attempts to raise a new claim on review based on evidence discovered after the record closed below. For these reasons, we will not consider the issues the appellant raises for the first time in his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Penalty of Removal Is Within the Bounds of Reasonableness</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We affirm the administrative judge's thorough analysis of the penalty and we need not repeat all of it here. Some factors warrant further discussion, however. When the Board sustains all the charges, it reviews the agency's choice of penalty only to determine whether the agency considered all of the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within the parameters of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Department of Defense,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). The Board's function is not to displace management's responsibility, but to ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06. Here, as the administrative judge found, there is ample evidence that the agency considered all of the relevant factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most important factor in an agency's penalty determination is the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relation to the appellant's duties, including whether the offense was intentional. <span class="Italic">Jinks v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 627, &#x00B6; 17 (2007). The appellant revealed information about FAM deployments in violation of regulations requiring that it remain confidential. His actions caused the agency to lose trust in him, and divulging security measures to the media created an immediate vulnerability in the aviation system. The appellant's revelation of confidential information to a reporter was intentional, by his own admission. Also significant to rehabilitative potential and the agency's penalty determination is that the appellant lacked remorse for disclosing the RON information, as reflected in his deposition. The agency could and did reasonably infer a risk from the appellant's lack of remorse that he would continue to make disclosures that were specifically prohibited by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After thoughtfully considering the entire record, we also are not persuaded that the appellant believed in "good faith" that he was permitted to share plans for the deployment of FAMs with the MSNBC reporter. At the time of his appointment in 2001, the appellant was presented with a single-page form captioned "Conditions of Employment for Federal Air Marshals." The appellant signed the form at the bottom, and initialed the form next to the following words: "I accept the position of Federal Air Marshal. I have read and I accept the Conditions of Employment." One of those conditions was that a FAM "may be removed" for "[u]nauthorized release of security-sensitive or classified information." Apart from this written acknowledgment of the seriousness of unauthorized disclosure of SSI in general, the appellant testified that in his training it was made "very, very clear" that FAMs should not tell anyone, not even their spouses, which flights they would be on because the information could be repeated to "the wrong people." The appellant further testified that telling someone a flight would not have a FAM on it would endanger the flight. Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant knew that he was not permitted to share information about FAM coverage with a reporter, regardless of the fact that he received the information as a text message on his cell phone instead of on his encrypted PDA, and even if he was unsure of its SSI classification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It makes no difference to our penalty analysis whether the appellant knew that the message suspending overnight missions fell within the regulatory definition of SSI. As explained immediately above, the appellant admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about FAM scheduling, yet he did so anyway, and it could have created a significant security risk. As a law enforcement officer, the appellant can be held to a high standard of conduct. <span class="Italic">Mahan v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 140, &#x00B6; 11 (2001); <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of Justice,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 234, 237 (1990). The appellant's actions in July 2003 did not exhibit the good judgment that the agency can legitimately expect of its law enforcement personnel. <span class="Italic">Mahan</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 140, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that he was treated more harshly than other similarly situated individuals who disclosed SSI and also that he and other FLEOA leaders were singled out for retaliatory treatment. As we explained when addressing the appellant's claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10), although the record reflects that the agency treated other employees less harshly for their disclosures of SSI, the circumstances surrounding those disclosures are plainly distinguishable and do not suggest that the agency subjected him to a disparate penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also accept, without finding, that the appellant believed he did the right thing in disclosing the information. We have specifically considered the appellant's testimony regarding his belief that TSA's plan to eliminate FAMs from overnight flights was "serious" and "dangerous to the...public," <span id="Page_3712"></span>and that his disclosure was motivated by his desire to protect the flying public. ("All I wanted to do was protect lives and...uphold the law."). The appellant also testified: "If I saved--if I saved a plane from falling out of the sky or saved a life, I believe I did my job, and I shouldn't regret it." Further, as the administrative judge concluded, we also have no reason to doubt that the appellant's motivation was sincere. (the administrative judge, when discussing the appellant's First Amendment claim, stated that he had "no reason to doubt the appellant's assertion that he took these actions to benefit the nation...."). However, even if the appellant could have established the classic elements of whistleblowing, i.e., that he disclosed a substantial and specific danger to public safety and that his disclosure was a contributing factor in his removal, he cannot invoke WPA protection because his disclosure was specifically prohibited by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For all of the above reasons as well as those explained by the administrative judge, we find that the agency's removal penalty did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness. The appellant's removal is SUSTAINED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit was not so quick to sustain the Board, vacating its decision and remanding the case for a whistleblowing merits decision when the court parted company with the Board on what is meant by disclosures prohibited by law, determining that the referenced law did not prohibit the disclosures by MacLean in <span class="Italic">MacLean v. DHS</span>, 714 F.3d 1301, 1308-11 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">DHS v. MacLean</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20150121g50">135 S. Ct. 913</a> (2015), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA prohibits individuals in positions of authority from taking a "personnel action" against a government employee in certain circumstances, particularly</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">because of any disclosure of information by an employee...which the employee...reasonably believes evidences...a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, if such disclosure is <span class="Italic">not specifically prohibited by law</span>....[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[2] The WPA was recently amended by the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA). Neither party argues that the WPEA applies to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (emphasis added). The Board rejected Mr. MacLean's affirmative defense that his disclosure of the text message was protected whistleblowing activity because it determined that the disclosure was "specifically prohibited by law" within the meaning of the WPA. The law that the Board relied upon is the ATSA, which states, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding section 552 of title 5..., the Secretary of Transportation <span class="Italic">shall prescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure of information</span> obtained or developed in ensuring security under this title <span class="Italic">if the Secretary of Transportation decides disclosing the information would...be detrimental to transportation safety.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119(b)(1) (2009) (emphases added). Because its conclusion that revealing the content of the text message was specifically prohibited by the ATSA made further WPA inquiry unnecessary, the Board did not reach the question of whether Mr. MacLean "reasonably believe[d]" that this information "evidence[d] ...a substantial and specific danger to public...safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); <span class="Italic">see MacLean II</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. at 581.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not dispute that, in order to fall under the WPA's "specifically prohibited by law" proviso, the disclosure must be prohibited by a statute rather than by a regulation. Thus, the core of the disagreement is whether the ATSA "specifically prohibit[s]" disclosure of information concerning coverage of flights by Marshals within the meaning of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. MacLean and his amici (three members of Congress) argue that the Board erroneously concluded that the ATSA's mandate to the Secretary of Transportation to "prescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure" of certain kinds of information is a specific prohibition under the WPA. They contend that the phrase "specifically prohibited by law" in the WPA can only refer to explicit statutory language that identifies specific classes of information. They argue that the ATSA's "detrimental to transportation safety" language does not establish particular criteria for withholding information and leaves a great deal of discretion to the Agency, which is inconsistent with the WPA's requirement of specificity. They contrast the ATSA with the Trade Secrets Act, which directly authorizes removal of any federal employee who divulges information that falls into particular categories. 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1905 (2008); <span class="Italic">see also Kent v. Gen. Servs. Admin.,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 536, 540-46 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government counters that Mr. MacLean violated a regulation promulgated pursuant to an express legislative directive in the ATSA, which made his disclosure "specifically prohibited" by a statute. It thus argues that Mr. MacLean's disclosure does not qualify for WPA protection. The government contends that Mr. MacLean's reading of the WPA eviscerates laws that provide for any Agency discretion in classifying information as SSI, and thus disables Congress from directing agencies to pass nondisclosure regulations. Lastly, the government argues that it does not make sense for Congress to order an agency to promulgate nondisclosure regulations and at the same time prohibit that agency from disciplining an employee for violating those regulations by providing a defense under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Mr. MacLean that the ATSA does not "specifically prohibit" the disclosure at issue in this case. The ATSA's plain language does not expressly prohibit employee disclosures, and only empowers the Agency to prescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure of SSI "<span class="Italic">if the Secretary decides</span> disclosing the information would...be detrimental to public safety." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119(b) (emphasis added). Thus, the ultimate source of prohibition of Mr. MacLean's disclosure is not a statute but a regulation, which the parties agree cannot be "law" under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notably, Congress changed the language "specifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation" in the statute's draft version to simply "specifically prohibited by law." Congress did so because it was concerned that the broader language "would encourage the adoption of internal procedural regulations against disclosure, and thereby enable an agency to discourage an employee from coming forward with allegations of wrongdoing." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2743. Congress explained that only "a statute which requires that matters be withheld from the public as to leave no discretion on the issue, or...which establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld" could qualify as a sufficiently specific prohibition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In contrast, the "detrimental to transportation safety" language of the ATSA does not describe specific matters to be withheld. It provides only general criteria for withholding information and gives some discretion to the Agency to fashion regulations for prohibiting disclosure. Thus, the ATSA does not "specifically prohibit" employee conduct within the meaning of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ATSA's insufficient specificity becomes even more apparent when it is contrasted with statutes that have been determined to fall under the WPA's "specifically prohibited by law" proviso. For example, the Trade Secrets Act, which the Board in <span class="Italic">Kent</span> held to qualify as a specific prohibition, is extremely detailed and comprehensive. 56 M.S.P.R. at 543-46. That statute penalizes federal employees who "divulge[] ...any information coming to [them] in the course of [their] employment...which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association...." 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1905. The same is true of &#x00A7; 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code, which the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Coons v. Secretary of the Treasury</span>, 383 F.3d 879, 890-91 (9th Cir. 2003), held to fall within the meaning of the WPA's "specifically prohibited" language. That statute prohibits federal employees from "disclos[ing] any return or return information obtained by him in any manner in connection with his service," 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6013(a)(1), and then goes on to define "return" and "return information" in explicit detail, mentioning such things as "a taxpayer's identity, the nature, source or amount of his income, payments, receipts, deductions, exemptions, credits, assets, overassessments, or tax payments...," <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 6013(b)(1), (2). Thus, when Congress seeks to prohibit disclosure of specific types of information, it has the ability to draft the statute accordingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, we note that the ATSA's charge to the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe regulations pursuant to specific criteria (i.e., only information that would be detrimental to transportation safety) makes this a very close case. Indeed, the ATSA appears to fall in the middle of the spectrum of statutes flanked at opposite ends by (a) those that fall squarely under the WPA's "specifically prohibited by law" proviso, such as the Trade Secrets Act and &#x00A7; 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code, and (b) those in which Congress delegates legislative authority to an administrative agency without circumscribing the agency's discretion. Regulations promulgated pursuant to Congress's express instructions would qualify as specific legal prohibitions. In this case, given the clarity of the statutory language and legislative intent behind the WPA's specificity requirement, the parameters set by Congress are not enough to push the ATSA over that threshold.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are similarly unpersuaded by the government's argument that a parade of horribles necessarily follows our adoption of Mr. MacLean's interpretation of the WPA. The government argues that, if Mr. MacLean is allowed to pursue his whistleblower defense, the WPA would in effect prohibit later Congresses from directing agencies to pass nondisclosure regulations. The government is concerned that, under Mr. MacLean's reading, the WPA would prohibit agencies from disciplining employees for violating nondisclosure regulations and thereby prevent agencies from enforcing such regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government is mistaken. In spite of the WPA, Congress remains free to enact statutes empowering agencies to promulgate and enforce nondisclosure regulations, and it has done so in the ATSA. The government ignores the fact that the ATSA covers a wide range of conduct that would not qualify as whistleblowing. For example, no one disputes that the ATSA empowers the Agency to promulgate regulations that enable it to discipline employees who reveal SSI for personal gain or due to negligence, or who disclose information that the employee does not reasonably believe evidences a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. The WPA also does not prohibit the Agency from <span id="Page_3713"></span>following the ATSA's mandate to regulate public access to information that the Agency might otherwise be forced to disclose under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Indeed, it appears that the paramount goal of the ATSA is to empower the Agency to reject the public's requests for Agency intelligence because the statute recites that, "[n]otwithstanding [FOIA] ..., the Secretary of Transportation shall prescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure of information obtained or developed in ensuring security under this title." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40119(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Public Citizen, Inc. v. FAA</span>, 988 F.2d 186, 194-96 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (analyzing the predecessor statute to the ATSA and explaining that Congress's desire to enable the Agency to bar FOIA requests for information that qualifies as SSI was one of the driving forces behind the passage of that statute). Our interpretation of the WPA does not deprive the ATSA of meaning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. MacLean's disclosure is not "specifically prohibited by law" within the meaning of the WPA, we <span class="Italic">vacate</span> the Board's decision and <span class="Italic">remand</span> for a determination whether Mr. MacLean's disclosure qualifies for WPA protection. For example, it remains to be determined whether Mr. MacLean reasonably believed that the content of his disclosure evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Certiorari</span> was sought and granted, moving Mr. MacLean's case to the Supreme Court, and that Court affirmed the Federal Circuit, concluding that MacLean's disclosures were not barred by law, <span class="Italic">DHS v. MacLean</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/insco20150121g50">135 S. Ct. 913</a> (2015) (Justices Sotomayor and Kennedy dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2003, the TSA's regulations prohibited the disclosure of "[s]pecific details of aviation security measures...[such as] information concerning specific numbers of Federal Air Marshals, deployments or missions, and the methods involved in such operations." 49 CFR &#x00A7; 1520.7(j). MacLean does not dispute before this Court that the TSA's regulations prohibited his disclosure regarding the canceled missions. Thus, the question here is whether a disclosure that is specifically prohibited by regulation is also "specifically prohibited <span class="Italic">by law</span>" under Section 2302(b)(8)(A). (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The answer is no. Throughout Section 2302, Congress repeatedly used the phrase "law, rule, or regulation." For example, Section 2302(b)(1)(E) prohibits a federal agency from discriminating against an employee "on the basis of marital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under any law, rule, or regulation." For another example, Section 2302(b)(6) prohibits an agency from "grant[ing] any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation." And for a third example, Section 2302(b)(9)(A) prohibits an agency from retaliating against an employee for "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, Congress did not use the phrase "law, rule, or regulation" in the statutory language at issue here; it used the word "law" standing alone. That is significant because Congress generally acts intentionally when it uses particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another. <span class="Italic">Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983). Thus, Congress's choice to say "specifically prohibited by law" rather than "specifically prohibited by law, rule, or regulation" suggests that Congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interpretive canon that Congress acts intentionally when it omits language included elsewhere applies with particular force here for two reasons. First, Congress used "law" and "law, rule, or regulation" in close proximity--indeed, in the same sentence. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) (protecting the disclosure of "any violation of any law, rule, or regulation...if such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law"). Second, Congress used the broader phrase "law, rule, or regulation" repeatedly--nine times in Section 2302 alone. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D)(i), (b)(1)(E), (b)(6), (b)(8)(A)(i),(b)(8)(B)(i), (b)(9)(A), (b)(12), (b)(13), (d)(5). Those two aspects of the whistleblower statute make Congress's choice to use the narrower word "law" seem quite deliberate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We drew the same inference in <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 494 U. S. 922 (1990). There, the Government argued that the word "laws" in one section of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 meant the same thing as the phrase "law, rule, or regulation" in another section of the Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 931. We rejected that argument as "simply contrary to any reasonable interpretation of the text." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 932. Indeed, we held that a statute that referred to "laws" in one section and "law, rule, or regulation" in another "cannot, unless we abandon all pretense at precise communication, be deemed to mean the same thing in both places." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. That inference is even more compelling here, because the statute refers to "law" and "law, rule, or regulation" in the same sentence, rather than several sections apart.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another part of the statutory text points the same way. After creating an exception for disclosures "specifically prohibited by law," Section 2302(b)(8)(A) goes on to create a second exception for information "specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs." This exception is limited to action taken directly by the President. That suggests that the word "law" in the only other exception is limited to actions by Congress--after all, it would be unusual for the first exception to include action taken by executive agencies, when the second exception requires action by the President himself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, a broad interpretation of the word "law"could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute. If "law" included agency rules and regulations, then an agency could insulate itself from the scope of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) merely by promulgating a regulation that "specifically prohibited" whistleblowing. But Congress passed the whistleblower statute precisely because it did not trust agencies to regulate whistleblowers within their ranks. Thus, it is unlikely that Congress meant to include rules and regulations within the word "law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Government warns that providing whistleblower protection to individuals like MacLean would "gravely endanger public safety." That protection, the Government argues, would make the confidentiality of sensitive security information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the TSA's 60,000 employees. And those employees will "most likely lack access to all of the information that led the TSA to make particular security decisions." Thus, the Government says, we should conclude that Congress did not intend for Section 2302(b)(8)(A) to cover disclosures like MacLean's.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Those concerns are legitimate. But they are concerns that must be addressed by Congress or the President, rather than by this Court. Congress could, for example, amend Section 114(r)(1) so that the TSA's prohibitions on disclosure override the whistleblower protections in Section 2302(b)(8)(A)--just as those prohibitions currently override FOIA. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 114(r)(1) (authorizing the TSA to prohibit disclosures "[n]otwithstanding section 552 of title 5"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2640(h) ("the Secretary of Defense may (notwithstanding any other provision of law) withhold from public disclosure safety-related information that is provided to the Secretary voluntarily by an air carrier for the purposes of this section"). Congress could also exempt the TSA from the requirements of Section 2302(b)(8)(A) entirely, as Congress has already done for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the National Reconnaissance Office. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, the President could prohibit the disclosure of sensitive security information by Executive order. Indeed, the Government suggested at oral argument that the President could "entirely duplicate" the regulations that the TSA has issued under Section 114(r)(1). Such an action would undoubtedly create an exception to the whistleblower protections found in Section 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Congress and the President each has the power to address the Government's concerns, neither has done so. It is not our role to do so for them.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next argues that disclosures 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 did not improperly disclose confidential information in violation of HIPAA, and instead were protected because they satisfied a HIPAA exception to the confidentiality requirement and they evidenced one of the conditions set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). As explained above, protected whistleblowing is the disclosure of information by an employee that the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(b). Whistleblowing, however, does not include a disclosure that is specifically prohibited by law, or required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign affairs unless such information is disclosed to the Special Counsel, the Inspector General of an agency, or an employee designated by the head of the agency to receive it. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(b); <span class="Italic">see Kent v. General Services Administration,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 536, 540-44 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly noted, HIPAA generally prohibits the disclosure of individually identifiable health information. Pub. L. No. 104-191, Sec. 1177; 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502. The administrative judge found that disclosures 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 improperly contained individually identifiable health information that was sent to parties that were unauthorized to receive it, and the disclosures were, therefore, not protected whistleblowing. The appellant does not dispute that these disclosures contained individually identifiable health information. He argues, however, that his disclosures satisfy exceptions to HIPAA's general prohibition and are, therefore, not barred by law and are protected under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3714"></span>HIPAA's implementing regulations specifically address the propriety of disclosures by whistleblowers. 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(j)&#x2003; Standard: Disclosures by whistleblowers and workforce member crime victims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1) Disclosures by whistleblowers. A covered entity is not considered to have violated the requirements of this subpart if a member of its workforce or a business associate discloses protected health information, provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The workforce member or business associate believes in good faith that the covered entity has engaged in conduct that is unlawful or otherwise violates professional or clinical standards, or that the care, services, or conditions provided by the covered entity potentially endangers one or more patients, workers, or the public; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The disclosure is to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;A health oversight agency or public health authority authorized by law to investigate or otherwise oversee the relevant conduct or conditions of the covered entity or to an appropriate health care accreditation organization for the purpose of reporting the allegation of failure to meet professional standards or misconduct by the covered entity; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;An attorney retained by or on behalf of the workforce member or business associate for the purpose of determining the legal options of the workforce member or business associate with regard to the conduct described in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has presented nonfrivolous allegations that disclosures 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 satisfy these requirements. All of these disclosures discuss conduct that arguably violates professional or clinical standards or that potentially endanger patients. Specifically, disclosure 2, concerns an unnecessary and improperly performed medical procedure and a patient abuse incident. Disclosure 3 discussed a poorly supervised procedure that allegedly caused a patient's death. Disclosure 4 alleges that a resident's failure to follow instructions caused harm to a patient, and disclosure 7 concerns inadequate supervision and training of interns, which could potentially endanger patients. Disclosure 8 includes claims of mismanagement of physician's workload and inadequate patient care, and disclosure 9 also describes instances of improper patient care and poor management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant sent a copy of each of these letters to a person or entity with oversight authority for the agency for the purpose of reporting the misconduct. The appellant sent copies of disclosures 2, 4, 8, and 9 to officials in the agency's Inspector General's Office, and sent disclosures 3 and 7 to agency officials overseeing the resident programs. We find that the appellant's submissions describing these disclosures constitute nonfrivolous allegations that the disclosures satisfied the HIPAA exceptions for nondisclosure, regardless of whether the appellant also sent these letters to persons who would not have satisfied these exceptions.[1] These disclosures also constitute nonfrivolous allegations of a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety, thereby satisfying the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The appellant has, therefore, met his jurisdictional burden with respect to these disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In light of this finding, we need not determine whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(B) would provide a sufficient basis, in the absence of 45 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 164.502(j), to protect a disclosure of information generally protected from disclosure under HIPAA. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) (excluding from coverage a disclosure "specifically prohibited by law") with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(B) (covering, without the exclusion mentioned in subparagraph (A), disclosures that are made to the Special Counsel, an agency inspector general, or another agency designated by the head of the agency to receive such disclosures).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments on review largely pertain to his affirmative defense under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). He contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that his disclosure was not protected under the WPA because the appellant "<span class="Italic">may</span> have violated" the Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-579, &#x00A7; 3, 88 Stat. 1897 (1974) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a), when he disclosed the information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disclosures specifically prohibited by law are not protected under the WPA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(b); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Parikh v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6; 33 (2011). The TECS information released here qualifies as a record in a system of records protected under the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 66 Fed. Reg. 52,984 (Oct. 18, 2001); 73 Fed. Reg. 43,457 (July 25, 2008). The appellant did not obtain the record subject's prior written consent to release the details of her border crossing to Amy Bergland, a staffer for U.S. Senator Carl Levin. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b). The appellant asserts that his disclosure was protected under "the Congressional exception to the Privacy Act." The release of the record, however, did not meet any of the exceptions set forth in section 552a(b), including, as the appellant admitted, the exception for release to "to either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee," <span class="Italic">see</span> &#x00A7; 552a(b)(9).[6] The appellant's disclosure to Bergland thus violated the Privacy Act. The Board found in <span class="Italic">Parikh</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6; 33, that disclosures violating the Privacy Act are not protected under the WPA.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Although the appellant claims that he had an "implicitly sanctioned channel of communication with Senator Levin's office regarding the operation of [his] work station," courts have held that disclosure to a single member of Congress is not authorized under section 552a(b)(9), <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Swenson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 890 F.2d 1075, 1077 (9th Cir. 1989) (citing OMB Circular No. A-108, Privacy Act Implementation: Guidelines and Responsibilities, 40 Fed. Reg. 28,948 (July 9, 1975)). Although we believe that an individual member of Congress might reasonably receive information intended for the use of a committee of which he is a part, <span class="Italic">cf., e.g., Parikh</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 197, &#x00B6; 27, the appellant has not alleged that he was providing the record for such use.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7] Because the appellant's disclosures violated the Privacy Act, this case may be distinguished from <span class="Italic">MacLean v.

Apr. 26, 2013), where the court remanded the case to the Board to determine whether the disclosures prohibited by an agency rule, but not specifically prohibited by law, might qualify for WPA protection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he cured any possible Privacy Act violation he may have committed because he retrieved the disclosure from Bergland "before it was communicated to a potentially unauthorized third party, thereby preventing, curing and/or negating the disclosure." He has, however, identified no authority recognizing that violations may be cured, and we were unable to find any such authority. Instead, the disclosure, or violation, occurred when the appellant sent the e-mail message to Bergland. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b); <span class="Italic">Harper v. United States</span>, 423 F. Supp. 192, 197 (D.S.C. 1976) ("While the Act does not specifically define the term 'disclosure,' common sense requires that this term be taken to denote the imparting of information which in itself has meaning and which was previously unknown to the person to whom it is imparted."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> OMB Circular No. A-108, Privacy Act Implementation: Guidelines and Responsibilities &#x00A7; b, 40 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Additionally, we note the following provision in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Handbook for Administrative Judges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The issuance of a protective order does not cure a Privacy Act problem.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Voorhis v.

Section 7211 secures the right of federal employees "individually or collectively, to petition Congress or a Member of Congress, or to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof." Although he raised this argument below, the administrative judge did not address it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant offered no support for his theory other than <span class="Italic">Voorhis</span>, and he overstates the Board's holding there.

None of the handful of other cases that address section 7211 is directly on point. The appellant's argument, however, rests on the assumption that he did not violate the Privacy Act. Given our finding to the contrary, we would effectively negate protection with respect to any disclosure made to a member of Congress if we were to adopt the appellant's expansive reading of <span id="Page_3715"></span>section 7211. <span class="Italic">See Isabella v. Department of State</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2008) (if statutes are capable of coexistence, courts must regard each as effective, and absent any clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one) (citing <span class="Italic">Morton v. Mancari</span>, 417 U.S. 535, 550-51 (1974)). Moreover, Congress clearly established "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review," of which the WPA is integral, to protect federal employees who claim retaliation for disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Convertino v.

Dep't of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Freeman also argues that the MSPB erred by failing to consider his arguments that the classification of the information in his emails was improper because the Air Force did not comply with the proper procedures under Executive Order 13,526. We agree with the MSPB that the Board is not a proper forum for resolving such a dispute since the Board does not have authority to assess the propriety of national security determinations. <span class="Italic">Croft v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 324 (M.S.P.B. 1989); <span class="Italic">see also Dept' of Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 526-30 (1988)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarily determined in <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Office of Indep. Counsel</span>, 79 MSPR 406, 414 (1998), that "disclosures that are prohibited by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) [pertaining to secrecy of grand jury proceedings] are not entitled to the protections of 5 USC 2302(b)(8)." For discussion of restrictions by agencies on disclosures of whistleblowing-related information by agency employees to their lawyers, refer to <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Schiffer</span>, 47 F. Supp.2d 16 (D.D.C. 1999), and <span class="Italic">Martin v. Lauer</span>, 686 F.2d 24 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
