<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-150"><span class="space">e.</span> Traditional Contingency Agreement; Fee Cap</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Most of the earlier discussion on contingency agreements concerns not the true contingency contract, but requests for enhancement of reasonable hourly fees based on factors including risk of nonpayment and quality representation. There is little discussion in Board case law on the effect of the traditional contingency fee agreement, often used in personal injury cases, that allows the lawyer a percentage of the winnings as his fee. The contingency fee contract is not used extensively in Board litigation because the winnings, i.e., back pay awards, are small in comparison to judgments or settlements in successful complex tort or commercial litigation. Normally it does not make good economic sense to predicate one's income as a lawyer on the possibility of recovery of a fraction of back pay in a Board appeal. Nonetheless, the traditional contingency agreement is used.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One issue concerning the contingency agreement is whether its use precludes or diminishes recovery of counsel fees under the Reform Act. The Supreme Court suggested in a case brought under 42 USC 1988, providing for fees in certain successful civil rights cases, that a traditional contingency arrangement does not impair a statutory right to recovery of counsel fees, <span class="Italic">Blanchard v. Bergeron</span>, 109 S. Ct. 939 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), directed lower courts to make an initial estimate of reasonable attorney's fees by applying prevailing billing rates to the hours reasonably expended on successful claims. And we have said repeatedly that "[t]he initial estimate of a reasonable attorney's fee is properly calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate." <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stetson</span>, 465 U.S. 886 (1984). The courts may then adjust this lodestar calculation by other factors. We have never suggested that a different approach is to be followed in cases where the prevailing party and his (or her) attorney have executed a contingency agreement. To the contrary, in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> and in subsequent cases, we have adopted the lodestar approach as the centerpiece of attorney's fee awards....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a contingent fee agreement were to govern as a strict limitation on the award of attorney's fees, an undesirable emphasis might be placed on the importance of the recovery of damages in civil rights litigation. The intention of Congress was to encourage successful civil rights litigation, not to create a special incentive to prove damages and shortchange efforts to seek effective injunctive or declaratory relief....&#8197;Congress has elected to encourage meritorious civil rights claims because of the benefits of such litigation for the named plaintiff and for society at large, irrespective of whether the action seeks monetary damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent cautions us that refusing to limit recovery to the amount of the contingency agreement will result in a "windfall."...&#8197;Yet the very nature of recovery under 1988 is designed to prevent any such "windfall." Fee awards are to be reasonable, reasonable as to billing rates and reasonable as to the number of hours spent in advancing the successful claims. Accordingly, fee awards, properly calculated, by definition will represent the reasonable worth of the services rendered in vindication of a plaintiff's civil rights claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not prevent an attorney from entering an agreement that caps the fee that the client will pay, but that allows counsel to recover full fees from the government, <span class="Italic">Francois v. OPM</span>, 64 MSPR 191, 196 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM further contends on review that the amount of attorney fees granted is unreasonable. It points to the contingency retainer agreement between the appellant and his representative, that limited the appellant's liability for attorney fees to $3,000. OPM repeats its allegation below that, because the appellant's liability for attorney fees was limited to $3,000, any award of attorney fees in excess of $3,000 is unreasonable. OPM thus asserts that the administrative judge erred by granting attorney fees in excess of $3,000. The administrative judge, however, correctly interpreted the agreement as limiting the appellant's liability to $3,000 in the event his appeal was unsuccessful, but not limiting on its face OPM's liability for attorney fees in the event the appellant prevailed in his appeal.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant's request for attorney fees in this matter is based on the "lodestar figure," i.e., the number of hours expended multiplied by the attorney's hourly billing rate of $200 per hour as set forth in the contingency retainer agreement. Thus, this case does not involve any entitlement to a contingency fee enhancement, which is not awardable under 5 USC 7701(g)<span class="Italic">. See Pecotte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 165, 167-69 (1992).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Traditional contingency arrangements may raise questions concerning the obligations of counsel toward their clients. <span class="Italic">Dominguez v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-623), noted as to the retainer arrangement: "Counsel's affidavit states that he took the case on a contingent fee basis and that the back pay will approximate $25,000. He does not indicate that he would waive or set off the contingent fee if successful in the pending application." It is unclear what the court was suggesting, but it could have been implying that counsel may need to refund some fees to a client, depending upon the relationship of the contingent and statutory fee recoveries.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jensen v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 35 MSPR 297, 299-300 (1987) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 858 F.2d 721 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>), developed, or perhaps confused, the relation between a contingency fee arrangement and an hourly rate recovery under Board procedures. The appellant, deceased at the time of the Board's final fee decision, originally agreed to pay her counsel the greater of 40% of her back pay award or the amount of any attorney fee award made by the Board. Her back pay was $20,771 gross, $11,692 net. Counsel concluded that he was entitled to 40% of the gross amount, or $8,308, but agreed to take $5,846 as settlement of the appellant's fee debt in exchange for authorization to pursue, and have the right to receive, any award of fees from the Board that the appellant might be granted. An AJ awarded $16,423, but determined the lawyer was entitled to receive only $10,577 because he had already received $5,846 from the appellant. The Board said the attorney would not agree to reimburse the appellant or her estate for the latter amount. On PFR the attorney claimed no deduction should have been made since he had an assignment of any fees that might be awarded from the Board. The Board disagreed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To award counsel the amount requested in his petition would result in a windfall to counsel, because the appellant has already reimbursed counsel for a portion of his services. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blessin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 26 MSPR 615, 617 (1985) (attorneys should reimburse their clients for attorney fees paid to prevent loss to clients and to avoid double benefits to attorneys); <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 31 MSPR 219, 224 (1986) (an award of attorney fees must not provide a windfall to an individual plaintiff)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has held that a fee award must go to counsel rather than the parties who pay their fees...the Board has held further that counsel should reimburse clients for attorney fees paid to prevent loss to clients and to avoid double benefits to counsel....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel has already been paid by appellant for the initial fifty-two hours of services rendered in the case and has again claimed compensation for those same hours. Counsel would thus be receiving exactly the double benefits which the Board found to be improper...and which, if paid, would result in counsel receiving more than the maximum reasonable attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because counsel has stated that he will not and is not legally obligated to reimburse the appellant for the money she paid him, his fee was properly limited to $10,577.29. We find, however, as did the administrative judge, that the total award of $16,423.53 is reasonable in this case. Therefore, the agency is obligated to pay to the appellant's estate the remainder of the fee award not paid to the appellant's attorney, that is, $5,846.24.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although the Board generally will not award fees to an appellant...under the specific circumstances of this case, this approach is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jensen</span> was reversed by <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 858 F.2d 721, 725 (Fed. Cir. 1988) [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-22-213.html#sec15-211">Payment of Fee to Counsel and Client</a>"]. The essence of that decision was that counsel fees are paid to counsel, and the Board may not demand as a condition of their payment that counsel agree to reimburse the client for what the client has paid. The decision suggested that disputes between counsel and client over finances are the province of disciplinary boards. A concurring opinion by Judge Friedman added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I see no reason why, because of an agreement by which the client has <span id="Page_4691"></span>assigned to the attorney a percentage of any fee that may be awarded, the government should be required to pay the attorney the full amount the Board determined is a reasonable fee, when the result is that the attorney receives more than the reasonable fee. In my view, the government satisfies its obligations under the statute to pay a reasonable attorney fee when it pays the attorney an amount that, when added to the fee that has already been paid to the attorney, equals that reasonable fee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 450 (1991) ("We find that RSHD's return of the $1,000.00 to the appellant is irrelevant to the amount of reasonable attorney fees the agency is required to pay to RSHD. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 858 F.2d 721, 724 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (the appellant's counsel was entitled to receive the total amount of the attorney fee award even though he had already received partial payment from the appellant)."). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-22-215.html#sec15-213">Repayment of Fee by Counsel to Client</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board demonstrated a disinclination to become involved in the mechanics of fee arrangements between counsel and client. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 42 MSPR 115, 119 n.7 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Jensen</span>). Some guidance on the contingency/statutory rate problem was offered in <span class="Italic">Venegas v. Mitchell</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1679 (1990). The Supreme Court squarely rejected the notion that counsel could not collect, under 42 USC 1988, both a statutory fee award and a contingent percentage of the damages received by the plaintiff. The plaintiff, having undertaken the contract with the attorney, could not avoid it by diminishing the contingent recovery with a set-off based on the statutory fee.</p>
