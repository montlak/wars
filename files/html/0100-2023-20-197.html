<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-191"><span class="space">3.</span> Contributing Factor Analysis</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">"A 'contributing factor' means the disclosure affected the agency's decision to threaten, propose, take, or not take the personnel action regarding the appellant." <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Dept. of Army</span>, 116 MSPR 525, 527 &#x00B6; 4, 2011 MSPB 71 (2011). The 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act "contributing factor" analysis altered the burdens of proof in IRA whistleblowing reprisal cases. The first decision considering these burdens, <span class="Italic">McDaid v. DHUD</span>, 46 MSPR 416, 420-24 (1990), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not had occasion previously to address the nature of the parties' respective burdens in an IRA under the WPA not involving a stay request. We, therefore, do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that Congress viewed the appellant's burden of showing retaliation as too stringent under previous law and the agency's burden of rebuttal as too low and it wished to redress that situation.... The WPA would establish a "more reasonable standard" for proving a nexus by requiring proof only that retaliation was "a factor" in a personnel action, rather than a "significant" or "predominant" factor. An employee would have to prove by "preponderant evidence" that retaliation was a factor....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, the agency's burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that retaliation was not a factor is a higher standard than preponderance of the evidence, the previous agency standard.... This higher burden comes into play only if the employee has established <span id="Page_3950"></span>by preponderant evidence that the whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the action, that is, that the agency's action was "tainted."...The heightened burden of proof required of the agency also recognizes that in proving the basis for an agency's decision, the agency controls "most of the cards," such as drafting of the documents supporting the decision, and the records that could document whether similar personnel actions have been taken in other cases.... The Board has held that "clear and convincing evidence" is "that measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 662-63 (1990); 5 CFR 1209.4(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the many possible ways to show by preponderant evidence that a protected disclosure is a contributing factor is to show that the official taking the action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant had not shown that his protected activity was a contributing factor. He did not, however, specify the standard of proof he was using. Thus, we consider here whether the appellant has made such a showing by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, it is undisputed that the appellant engaged in a protected disclosure under the WPA...to an agency's Inspector General.... The official whom the appellant accused of wrongdoing was his former first line supervisor....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant has shown that his activity was protected, he has not shown that the proposing official had actual or constructive knowledge of his protected disclosure. The proposing official...testified that she had no knowledge of any contacts the appellant might have made....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant has failed to show that the deciding official, who had actual knowledge of his disclosure, acted within a time period reasonably evidencing a retaliatory motive.... Because the disclosure occurred in February 1988, however, and her decision to suspend the appellant was not made until December 4, 1989, we find that a reasonable person would not be likely to conclude that the appellant's disclosure was a factor in the decision to suspend him.... Nor are there any other facts sufficient to establish by preponderant evidence that retaliation was a contributing factor in the suspension action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we assume, however, that the requisite contributing factor showing has been made, the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the suspension action absent any retaliatory motive. We base this conclusion on an analysis of the propriety of the agency's action and a finding that the penalty was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant admitted at the hearing that he did refuse to go to the meeting as he was ordered to do and did at least impatiently state to his supervisor, the proposing official, something to the effect of "you heard what I said" regarding his refusal to attend. Thus, the appellant was rude and refused to obey a legitimate order as charged.... Inasmuch as the misconduct was proven as charged, the proposing official had a non-retaliatory reason for proposing disciplinary action. Also, the deciding official had a non-retaliatory reason for deciding to effect the action. Needham explained that the action had been recommended by the appellant's then first line supervisor and that she, Needham, thought it was important to support the proposing official in this action because of the need to preserve the employee-supervisory relationship. Thus...there is no showing of any impropriety here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the agency has met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action against the appellant in the absence of his protected activity. We therefore do not order corrective action in this IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge erred in finding that the penalty was reasonable. He contends that another employee was only given a three day suspension for offenses more serious than his. As the administrative judge found, however, the appellant failed to introduce into the record any evidence regarding this claim. He merely alleged at the hearing that he had obtained such evidence through discovery. In the absence of specific evidence concerning this allegation, the administrative judge did not err in concluding that the appellant was not differently treated from another employee.... Moreover, as the administrative judge found, the penalty was reasonable as it was less than the minimum penalty provided for under HUD guidance.... [T]he agency's penalty was reasonable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another explanation of what constitutes a contributing factor is from <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. DOD</span>, AT-1221-14-0260-W-1 (NP 1/22/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "contributing factor" means any disclosure that affects an agency's decision to threaten, propose, take, or not take a personnel action with respect to the individual making the disclosure. <span class="Italic">Usharauli v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6; 31 (2011); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(c). The most common way of proving the contributing factor element is the "knowledge/timing test." <span class="Italic">Wadhwa v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 12, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 353 F. App'x 435 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Under that test, an appellant can prove that his disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the whistleblowing disclosure and took the personnel action within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once the knowledge/timing test has been met, the administrative judge must find that the appellant has shown that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue even if, after a complete analysis of all of the evidence, a reasonable fact finder could not conclude that the appellant's whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Rubendall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 12 (2006), <span class="Italic">superseded on other grounds by statute</span>, Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465. Any contrary evidence regarding a contributing factor may be considered in the context of the agency's burden to show clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the adverse action notwithstanding the appellant's protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Wadhwa</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), pointed out how a contributing factor could have been properly alleged to MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if Ms. Johnson seeks to show that the 2008 OSC complaint was a "contributing factor" without relying on the knowledge/timing test, she must still make non-frivolous allegations. Specifically, Ms. Johnson must make nonfrivolous allegations that "the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action." <span class="Italic">Cahill</span>, 821 F.3d at 1373. Such nonfrivolous allegations might address, for example, the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the whistleblowing was personally directed at Mr. Lake, and whether Mr. Lake had a desire or motive to retaliate against Ms. Johnson. Among other things, a non-frivolous allegation must be more than conclusory; in other words, it must consist of more than a general assertion of what Ms. Johnson must show. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that Ms. Johnson has not made such non-frivolous allegations. Ms. Johnson alleges that Mr. Lake was aware of the complaint and "delegate[d] the retaliation" to Tonya Freeman, Tameka Jones, and unnamed human resources personnel. But this allegation is conclusory--Ms. Johnson does not explain why or how Mr. Lake would have delegated retaliatory actions to those individuals.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">There is some difference between analysis of an IRA appeal involving disciplinary action and an appeal involving a nondisciplinary action that results in diminution of a benefit to an employee. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 101 MSPR 248, 252-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 2006 MSPB 41 (2006), an IRA decision holding against the appellant's reprisal charge, summarized the analyses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, when determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (1999); <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Department of Justice</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 682, 688 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 116 F.3d 1497 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that factor (1) does not apply straightforwardly to this case, as the personnel action at issue here is not disciplinary in nature, and therefore does not require supporting evidence of misconduct. In this context, we find it appropriate to consider instead the broader question of whether the agency had legitimate reasons for imposing the shift change. We find that it did. At the hearing, Leggiardro testified that he changed the appellant's hours to 0700-1500 because he needed a detective available during the day to answer questions about incidents recorded on the desk journal. He further stated that he relied heavily on the appellant for this purpose, as the appellant was the only civilian detective at Oceana. Leggiardro also expressed concern that the appellant had conducted unauthorized training on the night shift. Most significant, the appellant himself conceded that it was not unusual that his shift would be changed in order to meet mission requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to factor (2), the record includes evidence suggesting that Chief Master of Arms James Schwerdtfeger, who reported to Leggiardro, may have harbored a retaliatory animus towards the appellant. However, there is no indication that Leggiardro had any retaliatory motive, and it is undisputed that he was the official responsible for changing the appellant's hours on December 2, 2001. With regard to factor (3), the appellant contends that, after his hours were changed, other police officers continued to work 12 hour shifts. However, these employees were not similarly situated to the appellant inasmuch as he was the only civilian detective among them. In sum, we find that the agency had legitimate reasons for changing the appellant's work hours and that it would have done so in the absence of his whistleblowing activity.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As to the affirmative defense of whistleblowing reprisal raised in the adverse action defense, the IRA analysis, including the agency's burden to disprove the appellant's showing of reprisal by clear and convincing evidence, applies, <span class="Italic">Massimino v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 318, 323 n.7 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The IRA provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(i) directs the Board to apply subsections (a) through (h) of section 1221 "in any proceeding brought under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7513(d) if, or to the extent that, a prohibited personnel practice as defined by section 2302(b)(8) is alleged." As a result of this incorporation provision, whistleblowers appealing chapter 75 actions to the Board have the benefits of many of the rights and remedies that Congress provided for whistleblowers appealing under the IRA provision, such as the right to request that the Board stay a proposed, threatened, or already ejected personnel action and the right to have the action adjudicated under the "contributing factor" evidentiary standard, which is clearly more favorable to the whistleblower <span class="Italic">See generally Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 651, 656, 659-60 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the whistleblowing defense appears in an adverse action appeal, the agency has the burden of proving the charges, nexus, and propriety of the penalty, and the appellant has the burden of proving the affirmative defense, <span class="Italic">Shibuya v. USDA</span>, 119 MSPR 537, 548 &#x00B6; 19, 2013 MSPB 44 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an adverse action appeal, such as the appellant's demotion appeal, an appellant's claim of whistleblower reprisal is treated as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 22 (2005). Once the agency proves its adverse action case by a preponderance of the evidence, the appellant must show by preponderant evidence that he made a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of proof under the WPA is less stringent than under preexisting law, discussed subsequently. The appellant's burden is not particularly high. "As long as a protected disclosure played any part in retaliation, it is a contributing factor." <span class="Italic">Comito v. Dept. of Army</span>, 90 MSPR 58, 66 &#x00B6; 15 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Kinan v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 561 (2001) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 2022 MSPB 9 (2022)). The AJ's focus is to be on the appellant's evidence to determine whether the appellant establishes that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor; if so, the agency's evidence is then analyzed under the "clear and convincing" evidentiary standard. The AJ should not rely on the agency's rebuttal testimony to determine whether the appellant established that retaliation was a contributing factor. <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 370, 376 (1994).
