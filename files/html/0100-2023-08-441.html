<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-435"><span class="space">7.</span> Position Qualification Standard; Educational Requirement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An early employment practice challenge to an OPM qualification standard for a professional engineering position defined OPM's responsibilities in defending a challenge to those standards, <span class="Italic">Morris v. OPM</span>, 14 MSPR 578, 578-81 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to OPM Handbook X-118 the basic qualification requirement for a professional engineering position, GS-800 series, is a bachelor's degree in professional engineering which meets certain criteria as to accreditation and courses. As an alternative, an applicant may qualify through current state registration as a professional engineer if the registration is based on the passage of a written test administered by a state board of engineers. Failing these requirements, an applicant may also qualify if he or she has "demonstrated eminence in the specialty field" of engineering for the position for which he has applied. The handbook states that eminence in the specialty field is established where "the nature and necessary quality of [the applicant's] record of engineering leadership would typically qualify the candidate at the GS-15 grade level in the Federal Service."[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;"Eminence" requires "a record of accomplishment, professional competence, and recognition in the profession, as in the planning, organization, direction, and coordination, of engineering projects of major scope and complexity, or in the well-established service of the candidate as an expert advisor and consultant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant applied for several professional engineering positions at the GS 11/12 levels. However, he was rated ineligible by OPM on July 19, 1978, because he did not meet the qualifications criteria set forth in X-118. Although appellant does not object to the first two criteria set forth above, he does object to the use of the GS-15 level qualification standard as a benchmark for all GS 11/12 professional entry positions when the applicant has not earned a bachelor's degree from an accredited school or passed a State engineering certification examination after four years of technical experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part 300 of 5 CFR provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that each employment practice of the Federal government be based on a job analysis which identifies (1) the basic duties and responsibilities; (2) the knowledge, skills and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and (3) the factors that are important in evaluating candidates. 5 CFR 300.103(a). Part 300 also provides that there shall be a rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled and the employment practice used. 5 CFR 300.103(b); <span class="Italic">Hall v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPB 497, 11 MSPR 576 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, OPM relies solely upon an affidavit of the Director of its Standards Development Center, Paul Katz, who avers that the employment practice at issue was developed by "professional staffing specialists who were knowledgeable concerning the duties and responsibilities of Federal engineering positions" and the employment practice was based on "a thorough knowledge of the engineering positions in the Federal Government as developed by the analysis of those positions from the various Federal agencies that employ those professionals." In its brief in response to the Board's reopening order, OPM argues that this alone is sufficient to meet the preponderance of the evidence standard as the appellant has not offered any admissible evidence refuting its assertions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds this argument to be without merit. Part 300 contains numerous requirements that OPM must meet in connection with employment practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 300.103. In presenting a Part 300 case before this Board in actions arising prior to the effective date of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the only burden placed on an appellant is that if he or she "believes that an employment practice which was applied to him" violates Part 300, he or she shall appeal in writing and "set forth the basis for the candidate's belief that a violation occurred." 5 CFR 300.104 (1978). This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that all the evidence which is relevant to the finding of whether a requisite job analysis took place is peculiarly within the knowledge and control of OPM<span class="Italic">. See Selma, R &#x0026; D. R. Col. v. United States</span>, 139 U.S. 560, 11 S. Ct. 638, 35 L. Ed. 266 (1891); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. United States</span>, 365 U.S. 85, 96, 81 S. Ct. 421, 427, 5 L. Ed.2d 428 (1961). The Board also notes that the Federal Personnel Management Supplement 271-1, subchapter S6-1 (August 31, 1979), relating to "Qualification Standards" requires that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A record must be maintained in support of every qualification standard developed or approved by the Office of Personnel Management pursuant to this supplement. This record will show the results of the job analysis and the basis for the relationship determined to exist between the job in the occupation and the qualification requirements established by the standard. It will show evidence that the applicant appraisal methods have been approved by a professional psychologist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the basis of a thorough review of the record in light of the regulatory and FPM requirements applicable to the instant proceedings, the Board finds that the evidence presented by OPM to prove that a job analysis for the employment qualification at issue was performed is insufficient. The only evidence that a job analysis took place is an affidavit by the Director of Standards. He merely states that he is familiar with the OPM Qualification Standards for the GS-800 Professional Engineering Series and states that they were developed by staffing specialists based on an analysis of the various engineering positions in the Federal government. The agency presented no evidence that Mr. Katz played any role in the development of those standards and the record indicates that the affidavit of Mr. Katz is nothing more than a sworn version of the OPM response to appeal, dated June 27, 1979, in this case. As the Board found in its first remand order of December 9, 1980, in considering this argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he Board notes that although the submissions by the Office of Personnel Management have alluded to the existence of an appropriate job analysis "developed by professional staffing specialists," <span class="Italic">no documentation was produced to support the agency assertion</span>. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board cannot find that the arguments raised in that original OPM response rise to the level of evidence of any probative value simply by being reintroduced in affidavit form. The hearsay evidence of Mr. Katz is entitled to no probative value. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR 77 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board notes that in its brief on reopening, OPM asserts, without corroboration, that it would be both "unduly burdensome and unnecessary to force OPM to go through all of its records concerning the development of this standard." The Board cannot accept this contention since OPM's own procedures, contained in 271-1 FPM Supp. &#x00A7; 6-1 require that it keep a record in support of the qualification standard that it developed for the GS-800 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that OPM has failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employment practice at issue, the use of the GS-15 level qualification standard as a benchmark for all GS-11/12 professional engineer positions when the applicant has not earned a bachelor's degree in engineering from an accredited school or passed a State engineering certification examination after four years of technical experience, was based on the requisite job analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision is therefore REVERSED. OPM is hereby ORDERED to reevaluate appellant's qualifications for eligibility as an Electronic Engineer in the Federal service without considering the "eminence" standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Post v. OPM</span>, 26 MSPR 435, 440-44 (1985), considered a challenge to OPM's qualification standard for the GS-1670 Equipment Specialist series. The appellant won her case, although the decision was limited to an order directing her appointment to the position rather than an order invalidating the standard. The decision provides the Board's analysis on a statistical challenge demonstrating that the qualification standard had a disproportionately adverse impact on female applicants:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the issue of the applicability of the statistical evidence presented, we find it necessary to distinguish between a claim of "disparate treatment" and a claim of "disparate impact," as is made here by appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 1854 n.15, 52 L. Ed.2d 396 (1977). We find that such a distinction is particularly important where, as here, appellant challenges the qualification standard for the equipment specialist series on the basis of disparate impact but does not allege that OPM intentionally excludes women meeting that standard on the basis of their sex.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Board had stated that "[i]n order to demonstrate 'disparate impact,' an employee must show that some facially neutral employment practice has a substantially disproportionate impact on one group more than another.... Unlike a 'treatment' case, it is not necessary to show intent to discriminate." <span class="Italic">Drucker v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 13 MSPB 104, 106, 14 MSPR 436, 440 (1983), <span class="Italic">citing to</span> <span class="Italic">Teamsters v. United States</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Connecticut v. Teal</span>, 457 U.S. 440, 451, 102 S. Ct. 2525, 2533, 73 L. Ed.2d 130 (1982); <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson, supra</span>, 433 U.S. at 329, 97 S. Ct. at 2727; <span class="Italic">Crockett v. Green</span>, 388 F. Supp. 912, 918 (E.D. Wis. 1975), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 534 F.2d 715 (7th Cir. 1976). Thus, in the instant case, in order to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of sex discrimination, appellant need only show that the standard for the GS-1670 series utilized by OPM had a disparate impact on female applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the presiding official's finding, a comparison of the percentage of the representation of women in the governmental work force (2-plus percent) to the percentage of women in the nationwide labor force (5 percent) who qualify under the GS-1670 qualification standard is irrelevant in determining whether the standard has a disproportionate impact on women. Such a comparison is useless since it fails to show the effect of the standard on "all potential female" candidates, as opposed to only those who meet the challenged standard<span class="Italic">. See Connecticut v. Teal, supra</span>, 457 U.S. at 450, 102 S. Ct. at 2533, where, in considering disparate <span id="Page_842"></span>impact, the court stated that it has consistently focused on "employment and promotion requirements that create a discriminatory bar <span class="Italic">to opportunities"</span> rather than "on the overall number of minority or female applicants actually hired or promoted." Therefore, we find that, in the circumstances of this case, the appropriate comparison for determining any disparate impact of the qualification standard is the comparison of the percentage of women with qualifying experience and education to the percentage of men with such experience and education. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Ramsay</span>, 484 F. Supp. 190, 194-95 (E.D. Ark.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 631 F.2d 597 (8th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the statistical evidence submitted by appellant is not too broad to support a finding of disparate impact at the GS-12 level in view of the fact that the evidence submitted includes statistical evidence relating to qualifications at the GS-12 level. In support of her allegation of discriminatory impact, appellant introduced testimony by the Executive Director of the Scientific Manpower Commission, Betty Vetter, establishing that, because women have not traditionally entered the equipment specialist field, the kind of experience required under OPM's GS-12 qualification standard is not likely to be had by women. Ms. Vetter testified that under 4 percent of persons with qualifying experience under that standard would be women.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to that portion of the standard allowing the substitution of education for experience, Ms. Vetter testified that the OPM requirement of 12 semester hours per year would almost require a college major in related engineering subjects under a four-year college program, or related technology training under a less than four-year program, and that only persons pursuing a course of study in the engineering-related fields would be likely to have those qualifications. She further stated that, from 1971 to 1978, less than 5 percent of bachelor's degrees in engineering, and only 15.3 percent of bachelor's degrees in engineering and engineering-related fields combined, were awarded to women, and that those percentages have remained substantially the same. She concluded that, if bachelor's degrees in the related fields were counted, less than 10 percent of those who might qualify would be women and that, absent the substitution of education for experience, even fewer women, would qualify under OPM's qualification standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The accuracy of these statistical data have not been challenged by OPM. In fact, Dr. Ruth Cullen, a demographer with OPM, testified that she had no basis to question the validity of the data submitted by appellant to show the percentages of women receiving degrees in engineering and related fields. Consistent with Ms. Vetter's testimony, Dr. Cullen stated in her deposition that a person taking 12 semester hours in related engineering fields would probably be pursuing either a major or minor in one of those fields.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also submitted evidence that, of those who qualify based on either training or experience, 4 percent would be women. Thus, by showing that only 4 percent of those who qualify based on both training or experience under OPM's qualification standard would be women, appellant has made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discriminatory impact, where, as the presiding official found, 40 percent of the civilian workforce was female. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Ramsey</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 194-95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon appellant's establishment of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of sex discrimination, the burden would then ordinarily shift to the agency to show that its established standard bears a "manifest relationship" to employment in the GS-12 equipment specialist series. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson, supra</span>, 433 U.S. at 329, 97 S. Ct. at 2727. The parties, however, have stipulated that if the Board finds disparate impact, OPM agrees that appellant had been discriminated against on the basis of sex and will appoint appellant to the GS-12 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, pertaining to the third issue, the question remains as to whether, upon this finding of discriminatory impact, the Board would also be required to invalidate the qualification standard. In this regard, OPM contends that a qualification standard is not unlawful because it excludes disproportionate numbers of women or minorities if business necessity is shown. It asserts that this case is not a typical impact case because of the parties' stipulation that appellant would be appointed to the GS-12 position upon a showing of disparate impact. Also, it urges that, despite its stipulation, it did not concede that the qualification standard did not constitute a business necessity. Further, OPM asserts that the fact of its refusal at the hearing to agree to retroactive promotion if appellant showed discriminatory impact showed that it did not concede that its standard was illegal since retroactive appointment would have been the appropriate remedy if the standard were illegal. It concludes that, since under 5 CFR 1201.211, parties are permitted to stipulate to any matter of fact but not to conclusions of law or remedies, a treatment of the stipulation as an agreement that the standard is illegal would be a conclusion of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, however, contends that since OPM presented no evidence of the job relatedness of the qualification standard and the standard has a disparate impact on women, it should therefore be invalidated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The NAACP Legal Defense Fund and FEWLEF contend that the Board should require OPM to appoint appellant to the GS-12 level and should also invalidate the qualification standard. They argue that failure to invalidate the qualification standard would permit its continued use notwithstanding its demonstrated adverse impact on women.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the parties' stipulation effectively precluded OPM from presenting evidence to show the job-relatedness of the GS-12 qualification standard as required by <span class="Italic">Dothard v. Rawlinson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra.</span> Thus, there is no basis on which to determine whether that standard should be invalidated. Under these circumstances, we find it inappropriate to invalidate the GS-12 qualification standard since, because of the parties' stipulation, OPM was not afforded an opportunity to show that the standard, although having a discriminatory impact on women, was job related.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the initial decision is REVERSED, and OPM is ORDERED to appoint appellant to the GS-12 Equipment Specialist position in accordance with the parties' stipulation....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On a motion for clarification, <span class="Italic">Post v. OPM</span>, 27 MSPR 572, 575 (1985), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board did not intend its order to be interpreted to mean that OPM was to appoint appellant to a position within OPM. Rather, the Board intended OPM to direct the Department of the Army to appoint appellant to a GS-12 equipment specialist position. While we recognize that OPM may not directly appoint an individual to a position in the Department of the Army, under 5 CFR 5.3, OPM has authority to correct an erroneous disqualification of an employee by directing the appropriate agency to restore the employee to duty or take any other action necessary. Since OPM incorrectly found appellant unqualified for the position of equipment specialist, GS-1670-12, it must now correct its error under its authority in civil service rule 5.3, 5 CFR 5.3. Its speculation that appellant may not qualify for the reclassified equipment specialist position is no excuse for failure to comply. If appellant cannot be placed in the successor to the equipment specialist position, OPM must direct the Department of the Army to appoint her to another suitable GS-12 position for which she is qualified....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Qualification standards, and the possibility of waiver of those standards, were at issue in <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 105 MSPR 482, 488-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2007 MSPB 113 (2007), providing definition to employment standards challenges involving application of qualification standards and waivers by agencies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen the appeal on our own motion, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118, to address an additional issue in the ID. In what we perceive was her primary argument below, the appellant characterized her case as an employment practice appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), which allows "[a] candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by...[OPM] violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103" to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: First, the appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering; and, second, the employment practice must be alleged to have violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998). OPM need not be immediately involved in the practice in question, however. An agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an appealable employment practice action. <span class="Italic">Holse v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 6 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887). The term "employment practices" includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. Although that term is to be construed broadly, "an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an 'employment practice.'" <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Richardson v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 61 (1998) ("The appellant has not identified a basic requirement that was missing from the instrument the agency used to evaluate her application. Rather, she is simply contesting the agency's rating and handling of her individual application. Such a challenge is not within the Board's jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for appeal and jurisdictional response, the appellant did not specifically identify which basic requirement she believed that the agency violated and how that requirement might have been violated. As set forth below, however, she did not receive notice that she needed to allege a violation of a "basic requirement" to establish jurisdiction. The appellant did request relief by waiver of the educational and experience qualification standard used in her selection pursuant to the OPM Operating Manual, Qualification Standard for General Schedule Positions, General Policies and Instructions, Part C. We construe her request as an assertion that the agency misapplied that particular standard, and thus we find that she was not merely contesting the agency's personnel actions as to her application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for OPM's involvement, the AJ found that "there is no appealable <span id="Page_843"></span>employment practice in this case applied to [the appellant] by...OPM...or a practice by the agency pursuant to OPM rules." The agency's own file, however, includes a copy of the OPM qualification standard as to education and experience for the GS-0101 Correctional Treatment Specialist. This standard clearly formed the basis for the qualification standard used during the selection process. The record thus shows that the appellant's case may well fall within the body of appeals covered by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Qualifications for an engineering position were again at issue in an employment practices appeal, <span class="Italic">Sauser v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 403, 405-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10, 2010 MSPB 50 (2010), and the appeal was remanded for analysis when the Board accepted for purposes of jurisdiction the assertion that the agency misapplied OPM qualification standards in violation of OPM regulatory limitations involving educational requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An applicant for employment who believes that an employment practice applied to him by OPM violates a basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: First, the appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering; and second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 7 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "employment practices," which includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments, is to be construed broadly. <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d 720, 723-24 (Fed. Cir. 1983); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. Although an individual agency action or decision that is not a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an employment practice, an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an employment practice. <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Holse v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 6 (2004). OPM need not be immediately involved in the practice in question. <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888; <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 10 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency has conceded that its determination that the appellant was unqualified for the GS-0801-11 General Engineer position was based on its application of OPM's Qualification Standards for such positions. In addition, the agency's internal communications and communications with the appellant show that its decision was based on its application of OPM's standards. The agency has filed copies of the OPM Qualification Standards upon which it relied. We therefore find that the appellant has satisfied the first prong of the jurisdictional test, i.e., that the appeal concerns an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering. <span class="Italic">See Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 773 F.2d 313, 315 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6; 14 (2007); <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated previously, the second jurisdictional prong is a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated a basic requirement for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. That regulation requires that employment practices be based on a "job analysis to identify: (1) The basic duties and responsibilities; (2) The knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and (3) The factors that are important in evaluating candidates." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a). There must also be a "rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled...and the employment practice used. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b)(1). The appellant alleged that the agency's job analysis led to the "identification of erroneous factors that the Agency deemed important in evaluating candidates," and that the agency's misapplication of OPM's Qualification Standards lead to the elimination of "any rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled and the employment practice used to establish educational requirements." We find that the appellant's allegations satisfy the second prong of the jurisdictional test, i.e., that he has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's application of OPM's Qualification Standards violated basic requirements for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See Mapstone,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 8; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a)(3), (b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal is unlike <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 157, 160 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), in which the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction because he merely alleged that the agency failed to fully consider his education and experience in making its selection; Banks did not allege that the agency misapplied to him any measurement of employment developed by OPM or that the agency applied to him any invalid measurement. Rather, the appellant here has made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction like the appellant in <span class="Italic">Mapstone,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 8, and <span class="Italic">Mapstone,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, who claimed that the agency misapplied OPM's Qualification Standards by imposing minimum education requirements that lacked a rational relationship to the position to be filled. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another challenge to an agency implementation of OPM regulations concerning educational requirements, applied by an agency to preclude consideration of the appellant for a position sought through merit promotion procedures, survived preliminary dismissal of an employment practice challenge and was remanded for further development, <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 106 MSPR 691, 693-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-16, 2007 MSPB 243 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a GS-0401-12 Fire Management Officer with the National Park Service in Tupelo, Mississippi. In July 2006, he applied for a GS-0401-13/14 Fire and Aviation Management Officer position with the National Park Service in Atlanta, Georgia, that was advertised in Vacancy Announcement No. SESO 06-82. The vacancy announcement required, in relevant part, that an applicant have a "[d]egree" in "biological sciences, agriculture, natural resource management, chemistry, or related disciplines appropriate to the position" and a "[c]ombination of education and experience--[c]ourses equivalent to a major,...plus appropriate experience of [sic] additional education. The vacancy announcement noted that the position "is covered under the Supplemental Qualification Standard for the GS-0401 Fire positions...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In response to the appellant's requests for clarification regarding the reasons for his non-selection, the agency issued a letter on October 13, 2006, explaining that, pursuant to the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Qualifications Standard for General Schedule Positions, an applicant must meet the basic requirements for the "401 series," including a "degree" in the relevant fields of study. The agency further stated that a "degree is identified as successful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's degree that included a major field of study or specific course requirements generally...." The agency explained that, since the appellant had attained only an Associate's Degree in Agriculture from the State University of New York and an Associate's Degree in Forestry from Northland Pioneer College, he failed to qualify for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed this appeal on October 17, 2006. The administrative judge subsequently notified the appellant that the Board may not have jurisdiction over his non-selection for promotion and ordered him to submit argument and evidence establishing Board jurisdiction. In response to the administrative judge's order and the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the appellant argued that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 300.103 and 300.104(a). He asserted, in effect, that the agency's determination that he failed to meet the basic requirements of the Fire and Aviation Management Officer position was an "employment practice" that violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b) because there was no "rational relationship" between performance in the position and the educational requirements imposed by the agency. He further noted that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b) generally prohibits the establishment of a "minimum educational requirement." Finally, he contended that he exceeded the basic requirements for the position based on his 14 years of experience as a Wildland Fire Manager and his related achievements and publications. He submitted several documents in support of his contentions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "employment practices" includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. Although that term is to be construed broadly, "an individual agency action or decision that is not made <span id="Page_844"></span>pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an 'employment practice.'" <span class="Italic">Prewitt,</span> 133 F.3d at 887; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Richardson v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 61 (1998) ("The appellant has not identified a basic requirement that was missing from the instrument the agency used to evaluate her application. Rather, she is simply contesting the agency's rating and handling of her individual application. Such a challenge is not within the Board's jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant specifically identified the employment practice he believed was a violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, namely, the qualification standard applied to him, i.e., a full 4-year course of study leading to a bachelor's degree. Further, the appellant alleged that the foregoing employment practice violates a basic requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. That regulation requires that employment practices be based on a "job analysis to identify: (1) The basic duties and responsibilities; (2) The knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and (3) The factors that are important in evaluating candidates." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a). There must also "be a rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled...and the employment practice used," proof of which includes a showing that "the employment practice was professionally developed." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b). "A minimum educational requirement may not be established except as authorized under section 3308 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the appellant alleged, in effect, that there is no rational relationship between the minimum educational requirement set forth in the vacancy announcement and performance in the Fire and Aviation Management Officer position and that the minimal education requirement violated the provisions of &#x00A7; 300.103(b). He also cited an excerpt from the General Policies and Instructions of OPM's Qualification Standard for General Schedule Positions, stating that "[i]t is important to remember that on rare occasions there may be applicants who may not meet exactly the educational requirements for a particular series, but who, in fact, may be demonstrably well qualified to perform the work in that series because of exceptional experience or a combination of education and experience."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, an appellant must allege that OPM is involved in the administration of the employment practice allegedly violated. <span class="Italic">Prewitt,</span> 133 F.3d at 887. In this regard, an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement under 5 C.F.R. part 300 may constitute an employment practice that is appealable to the Board, but only if OPM is involved in the administration of the practice in a significant way. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 887-88. Here, the administrative judge found that OPM was not involved in the agency's actions. The agency's own file, however, includes a copy of the OPM qualification standard as to education and experience for the 401 series positions, which the agency cited in its October 13, 2006 letter as the basis for its determination that the appellant failed to meet the basic requirements of the Fire and Aviation Management Officer position. This standard clearly formed the basis for the qualification standard used during the selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant specifically alleged, both below and on review, that OPM applied the employment practice that violated a basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. On review, he alleges that the "GS-0401 Series Fire Management Officer positions are governed by OPM through the Federal Fire and Aviation Leadership Council" and that OPM approved the Supplemental Qualification Standard for the GS-0401 series positions. We find these allegations, along with the undisputed record evidence, show that the appellant's case may well fall within the body of appeals covered by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we REMAND this appeal to the regional office. On remand, the administrative judge shall afford the parties an opportunity to present evidence and argument on the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over this employment practices claim. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant has established the Board's jurisdiction over this claim, she shall adjudicate the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, another initial decision dismissed Mr. Mapstone's case, there was another appeal, and another remand, as the Board again explained its jurisdiction over an employment practice case challenging the imposition or application of educational requirements involved in a job selection, <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 110 MSPR 122, 123-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8, 2008 MSPB 224 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a GS-12 Fire Management Officer with the National Park Service in Tupelo, Mississippi. In July 2006, he applied under agency Vacancy Announcement No. SESO 06-82 for a GS-0401-13/14 Fire and Aviation Management Officer position in Atlanta, Georgia. The vacancy announcement required, in relevant part, that an applicant have a "[d]egree" in "biological sciences, agriculture, natural resource management, chemistry, or related disciplines appropriate to the position" and a "[c]ombination of education and experience-[c]ourses equivalent to a major,...plus appropriate experience of [sic] additional education." The vacancy announcement noted that the position "is covered under the Supplemental Qualification Standard for the GS-0401 Fire positions...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 31, 2006, the agency notified the appellant that he had not been selected for the position because he "did not meet the minimum qualifications requirements as stated in the vacancy announcement" and failed to "meet basic requirements. The agency subsequently explained that the appellant was required to have a "degree" in the relevant fields of study, that a "degree" was identified as successful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's degree that included a major field of study, and that, because he had two Associate's degrees, he failed to qualify for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then filed this appeal. In response to the administrative judge (AJ)'s order and the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the appellant argued, in part, that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 300.103 and 300.104(a). He asserted that the agency's determination that he failed to meet the basic requirements of the Fire and Aviation Management Officer position was an "employment practice" that violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b) because there was no "rational relationship" between performance in the position and the educational requirements imposed by the agency, and that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b) generally prohibits the establishment of a "minimum educational requirement." Finally, he contended that he exceeded the basic requirements for the position based on his 14 years of experience as a Wildland Fire Manager and his related achievements and publications. He submitted several documents in support of his contentions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without holding the requested hearing, the AJ dismissed the appeal, finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over "an agency's selection process. With respect to the appellant's allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal as an employment practices case under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104, the AJ found in the ID that, even assuming that the appellant sufficiently identified an "employment practice," there was no employment practice applied by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as the regulation provides.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a PFR of the ID. The Board granted the appellant's petition, affirmed the ID in part, vacated it in part, and remanded the appeal to the regional office to afford the parties an opportunity to fully develop the record on the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal as an employment practices claim. <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 691 (2007)<span class="Italic"> (Mapstone l).</span> On remand, the AJ again dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant had failed to meet his burden to show, not merely allege, that the employment practice violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. The appellant has now filed a PFR of the AJ's RID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Analysis</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We grant the appellant s PFR and reverse the RID because the AJ misapplied the jurisdictional burden for establishing an employment practices appeal. The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: First, the appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering; and second, the employment practice <span class="Italic">must be alleged</span> to have violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed.

In<span class="Italic"> Mapstone I,</span> the Board cited to that standard, but inadvertently omitted that the second condition is met by a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing the evidence and argument in the record, we find that the appellant has met the criteria for establishing the Board's jurisdiction over his employment practices appeal. First, the appeal involves an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering. The term "employment practices" includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. Moreover, an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an appealable employment practices action. <span class="Italic">Holse v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 6 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Prewitt,</span> 133 F.3d at 887). Second, by alleging that there is no rational relationship between performance in the position and the educational requirements, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b), the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated a basic requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A check of initial decisions shows that Mr. Mapstone apparently settled his case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 116 MSPR 292, 297-300 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-21, 2011 MSPB 31 (2011), involving a challenge to an educational requirement, emphasized the appellant's burden in an employment practices case of showing that the challenged practice was applied to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below that the minimum educational requirement that the agency prescribed for the Aerospace Engineer position was in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. He further alleged that the instant appeal is akin to <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691 (2007), <span class="Italic">appeal after remand</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122 (2008), another employment <span id="Page_845"></span>practices case regarding a challenge to a minimum educational requirement. Under the circumstances, we find that the administrative judge should have notified the appellant of how to establish Board jurisdiction over an employment practices claim. However, she did not do so, and the initial decision does not address the employment practices issue. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. at 589. The appellant argues on petition for review that the Board has jurisdiction over his employment practices claim, and he requests a jurisdictional ruling on the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An applicant for employment who believes that an employment practice applied to him by OPM violates a basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: First, the appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering; and second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appeal concerns the validity of a minimum educational requirement. The Board has found that the prescription of a minimum educational requirement is an "employment practice" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). <span class="Italic">Mapstone</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6; 13. It also appears that OPM was involved in administering this employment practice because the vacancy announcements themselves explicitly attribute the basic qualification requirements to OPM. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Mapstone</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6; 14 (OPM was involved in administering the qualification standard at issue because OPM formulated it); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 12 (2007) (same); <span class="Italic">see also Lackhouse</span>, 773 F.2d at 315 (OPM was involved in administering the "rule of three" because OPM promulgated the governing regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">So far, it appears that the first condition of jurisdiction is satisfied. However, implicit in the requirement that the appeal concern an employment practice is that it concern an employment practice that was applied to the appellant. An individual's right to appeal an employment practice arises under the following regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A candidate who believes that an employment practice <span class="Italic">which was applied to him or her</span> by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the challenged employment practice is a minimum educational requirement. The purpose of a minimum educational requirement, like other minimum qualification standards, is to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">identify applicants who are likely to perform successfully on the job, and to screen out those who are unlikely to do so. The standards are not designed to rank candidates, identify the best qualified applicants for particular positions, or otherwise substitute for a careful analysis of the applicant's knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Office of Personnel Management, Operating Manual: Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, Policies and Instructions, Introduction, <a href="http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/policy/index.asp">http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/policy/index.asp</a> [now at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classificationqualifications/

<p class="Block-Quote1">The documentary evidence suggests that the appellant's nonselection was not based on his failure to meet the minimum educational requirement. Only applicants who meet the minimum qualification standards will appear on a register of eligibles, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313, and the record shows that the agency placed the appellant on registers of eligibles for both of the vacancy announcements at issue here. Because it appears that the agency found that the appellant satisfied the allegedly unlawful minimum educational requirement, its application of that requirement may not have been the basis of appellant's nonselection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that, in order for the Board to have jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal, it is "necessary that the challenged employment practice have been applied to the applicant as the basis for the adverse hiring decision." <span class="Italic">Dow v. General Services Administration</span>, 590 F.3d 1338, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) (an applicant is entitled to relief from an unlawful employment practice that "was applied to him"). In this case, the evidence tends to show that the agency's reason for not selecting the appellant was not, nor could it have been, based on any failure to meet the minimum educational requirement. In addition, there is no indication in the record that the agency would have hired the appellant in the absence of the minimum educational requirement. <span class="Italic">See Dow</span>, 590 F.3d at 1344.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we decline to dismiss the appellant's employment practices claim for lack of jurisdiction at this stage of the appeal. The appellant raised his employment practices claim below, and the administrative judge failed to notify him of his jurisdictional burden over such a claim. As with any other basis for jurisdiction, when an appellant raises an employment practices claim, an administrative judge must inform him with specificity of his burden of proving the claim, his burden of going forward with the evidence, and the types of evidence necessary to make a nonfrivolous allegation.[4] <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 13. Moreover, neither the agency's filings nor the initial decision notified the appellant of what is required to establish jurisdiction over his claim. <span class="Italic">See Parker</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Assuming that the appellant can establish that the appeal concerns an OPM employment practice that was applied to him as the basis of the adverse hiring decision, we find that he has met the second condition for Board jurisdiction over his claim, i.e. he made a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the basic requirements for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Mapstone</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 7.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ballow v. DHS,</span> SF-300A-10-1026-I-1 (NP 6/27/2011), rejected a challenge to a job analysis based on the appellant's belief that a certain type of experience should have been considered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that the agency violated one of the basic requirements for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 when it failed to conduct a proper job analysis. Specifically, he asserts that a "proper Job Analysis had not been exercised when the job announcement was published" and that the agency failed to prove that a job analysis was performed or to establish whether the analysis covered "a single position or group of positions, or an occupation or group of occupations, having common characteristics." He also asserts that a proper job analysis would have taken into account "Legacy DOJ/INS GS-1811's serving abroad in a temporary Secondary Law Enforcement position in the GS-1801 designation, performing the same enforcement duties as their GS-1811 counterparts in the states."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to establish that the agency's job analysis was improper. He fails to identify or cite the testimony that allegedly reflects that the agency did not perform a proper job analysis or that the agency's job analysis resulted in employment practices that did not have a rational relationship to the position. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (before the Board will undertake a complete review of the record, the petitioning party must explain why the challenged factual determination is incorrect, and identify the specific evidence in the record which demonstrates the error). Moreover, the vacancy announcement in the record includes the basic duties and responsibilities of the Criminal Investigator position, the knowledges, skills, and abilities required, and the factors important in evaluating candidates. The appellant has pointed to nothing in the regulations that would have required the agency to analyze "Legacy DOJ/INS GS-1811's serving abroad in a temporary Secondary Law Enforcement position in the GS-1801 designation" as part of a job analysis for the position of Criminal Investigator, GS-1811-12. Rather, the regulation simply notes that a single job analysis <span class="Italic">may</span> cover more than one position or occupation sharing common characteristics. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's petition for review essentially argues that the agency failed to appropriately consider his past experience in the 1801 and 1811 series when it found that he was not qualified for the position of Criminal Investigator, GS-1811-12. The administrative judge found that the appellant relied on his past experience in law enforcement positions in both the 1801 and 1811 job series in his application package and that the agency presented evidence that it considered applicants' experience in any job series to meet the required specialized experience. The administrative judge's finding on this issue is consistent with the weight of the evidence, and the appellant has not identified any reason to disturb it. <span class="Italic">See Broughton v.

Furthermore, as the administrative judge also found, the appellant's assertion that the agency failed to consider his previous experience in the 1801 and 1811 job series constitutes a mere dispute of the agency's rating and handling of his individual application, which is beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: first, the appeal must concern an employment practice that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is involved in administering; and second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Sauser v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 6 (2010).

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has failed to identify an employment practice that OPM administers or an OPM requirement that the agency misapplied, and find that the jurisdictional dismissal of the appeal was thus proper. In support of his appeal, the appellant argued that the agency failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 by failing to develop selection criteria based on a professionally developed job analysis. Whether an agency relied upon a professionally developed job analysis is a basic requirement of a valid employment practice, such as a scoring formula, time-in-grade requirement, or qualification standard for a position series. <span class="Italic">See Chadwell v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 629 F.3d 1306, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Mapstone v.

Here, however, the appellant has only asserted that the agency failed to use a professional job analysis to develop the criteria for the promotional opportunity at issue. Because the appellant has failed to allege that OPM was involved in developing or administering the alleged invalid criteria used by the agency, or that the agency misapplied an employment practice in the course of its merit promotion determination, his appeal is best characterized as a challenge to the agency's individualized hiring decisions, which purportedly favored a select group of female applicants. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887-88; <span class="Italic">see also Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 8 (the agency's assessment of the appellant's qualifications was based on OPM's general engineer qualification standards and was considered an employment practice); <span class="Italic">Mapstone</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6; 14 (the agency's decision that the appellant was not qualified was based on OPM's qualification standards and education requirements for the position series, thus constituting an employment practice).

<p class="Block-Quote1">An applicant for employment who believes that an employment practice applied to him by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) violates a basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: First, the appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering; and second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 7 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we find that the appellant failed to establish that his appeal concerns an employment practice. Specifically, the appellant is not challenging the validity or the applicability of the qualification standards at issue. Rather, the appellant is merely arguing that the agency should have found him qualified for the Pharmacy Technician position based on those qualification standards. This amounts to a challenge to the agency's rating and handling of his individual application, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over such a claim. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 60-61 (1998); <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 157, 160 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (an individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an "employment practice"). A challenge to an examination rating is properly raised before OPM rather than the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency "misapplied" the qualification standards in this case. Although an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an "employment practice" for purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), <span class="Italic">see Russo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 12 (1999), "misapplication of a valid OPM requirement" does not pertain to an allegedly inaccurate evaluation under a valid OPM requirement. Rather, "misapplication of a valid OPM requirement" means that the very application of the requirement to the candidate violated one of the basic requisites of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Because the appellant in this case has not alleged that the qualification standards at issue are inapplicable to his situation, he has not alleged that the agency "misapplied" those requirements within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Myers v. DHUD,</span> AT-3443-10-0931-I-1 (NP 6/23/2011), rejected an employment practices claim based on the assertion that the agency failed to state a specific job requirement in a position announcement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: First, the appeal must concern an employment practice that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is involved in administering; and second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 292, &#x00B6; 15 (2011); <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 7 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to meet the second prong of the jurisdictional test. She argues that the agency's process of evaluating candidates for the position was flawed because the agency failed to include the requirement that candidates possess unlimited signatory authority, which she argues is a duty of the position. Even if we accept as true the assertion that unlimited signatory authority is a duty or requirement of the position, the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated a basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. The standard, as stated in the regulation, requires that there shall be a rational relationship between the employment practice and performance in the position to be filled. The appellant simply alleges that unlimited signatory authority was a duty of the position and, as such, the agency was obligated to include it as a requirement to qualify for the position. This alone, however, is not a nonfrivolous allegation that the qualification requirements for the position violated one of the basic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. Specifically, the appellant has failed to allege that the agency's failure to do so resulted in a qualification requirement that was not rationally related to performance in the position. Further, to the extent that she argues that the qualification standards did contain an unlimited signatory authority requirement that the agency misapplied in this instance, the Board does not have jurisdiction over such a claim. <span class="Italic">See Manno v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 7 (2000).</p>
