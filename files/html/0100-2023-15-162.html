<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-161"><span class="space">e.</span> Federal Labor Law Policy; Collective Bargaining Contract</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Employees may be given orders that do not violate a constitutional right but impair a right under a labor agreement. Normally, an employee who refuses an order based on his honest belief that a negotiated agreement makes the order unlawful will find himself at odds with both his employer and the MSPB. The employee is expected to obey and then grieve. <span class="Italic">Sepulveda v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 38 MSPR 449, 451 n.2 (1988). A nonprecedential order in <span class="Italic">Morris v. VA</span>, 2010 MSPB 162, n.1 (2010 NP) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting on another issue), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is a substantial reason to believe that the order is not proper; rather, he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances where obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation, or when complying with the order would cause him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">E.g., Bowen v. Department of the Navy</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 15 (2009); <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. Department of Defense</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 508, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 605 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-08, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The appellant's allegations that Morrisett's leave procedures violate hospital policy or the collective bargaining agreement do not fall within the limited circumstances that would allow him to refuse to comply with Morrisett's instructions regarding leave-requesting procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was fired for refusing to shave his beard in accordance with an agency safety policy concerning grooming of individuals performing certain types of industrial work. The agency did not properly negotiate its rule concerning grooming with the union. The FLRA concluded that the agency committed an unfair labor practice by failing to negotiate over the rule. The Board concluded that despite the ULP, the employee should have obeyed the order pending resolution of its legality. In mitigation the Board considered the need to balance the integrity of the collective bargaining process and the right of management to impose discipline. Because the refusal to comply with the order was blatant and compliance would have resulted in no more than inconvenience, a penalty was warranted. The removal was reduced to a 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Gragg v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 296, 299-300, 11 MSPB 546 (1982), <span class="Italic">modified</span> <span class="Italic">by</span> <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 470, 474 n.3 (1994) [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-15-161.html#sec8-160">Improper Directive; Command Influence</a>"] . <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the issue of what obligation, if any, did appellant have to obey an order based on an invalid policy. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Birmingham,</span> 388 U.S. 307, 87 S. Ct. 1824, 18 L. Ed.2d 1210, the Supreme Court held that "petitioners...could not bypass orderly judicial review of the injunction to prohibit parades, etc., before disobeying it in spite of the injunction being overbroad and arguably unconstitutional." The case stands for the proposition that individuals do not have the unfettered right to disregard a law, rule or regulation merely because substantial reason exists regarding the constitutionality or validity of that law, rule or regulation. Applying the foregoing to the present case, appellant was obliged to obey the agency's order while taking whatever necessary steps he thought appropriate to challenge the ultimate validity of the order and policy. To find otherwise would have the effect of undermining the statutory scheme established to preserve employee rights without unreasonably preventing agencies from carrying out their missions. It should be noted <span id="Page_2645"></span>that in certain limited circumstances employees may disobey an order which would place them in a clearly dangerous situation.[4] However, appellant presented no claim other than the allegation of an unfair labor practice that would show that he had more than a cosmetic interest in maintaining his beard. We must assume therefore, that only a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> harm would have befallen appellant had he shaved pursuant to the order and then appealed the alleged unfair labor practice to an appropriate forum. The agency established a rational basis for the change in working conditions, that is, to insure greater safety for employees working in an enclosed area. We, therefore, find that appellant was unjustified in disobeying the agency's order to be clean shaven on five consecutive working days, from April 30, 1980 through May 5, 1980.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The resolution of the discipline question must therefore be balanced between the need to protect the integrity of the collective bargaining obligation and management's right to provide appropriate discipline. Appellant's refusal to conform to the requirements that he be clean shaven was a blatant act of disobedience. Additionally, the inconvenience or aggravation suffered by appellant in conforming to the policy, at least on an interim basis until the question of the need for bargaining was resolved, would have been minimal. On the other hand, appellant had been employed by the federal government for eight years, had performed his duties as an Equipment Cleaner in above average fashion and had no previous disciplinary record. Taking all these factors into consideration, the Board concludes that the maximum reasonable discipline necessary to impress upon appellant his obligation to obey orders which do not pose a direct threat to his physical well being is a 30-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gragg</span> had an interesting history after the 1982 decision. The Federal Labor Relations Authority decided that the agency committed an unfair labor practice by failing to negotiate with the union over its shaving policy. The FLRA eventually enforced its bargaining order in court. Meanwhile, the agency refused to comply with the FLRA directive; it would not negotiate. The employee returned to the work site as a result of the Board's order, was again told to shave, again refused, again was fired, and again appealed. The Board became concerned enough to take a closer look at the presumption of validity that for orders of supervisors that it established in its first decision. In <span class="Italic">Gragg-II</span> (<span class="Italic">Gragg v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 506, 510 (1984)), the Board announced that the order was valid when issued in the first case, although it was subsequently successfully challenged before the FLRA. In the second case, however, given the FLRA ruling, the order was a violation of law; therefore, the order was improper and, accordingly, removal on the basis of the unlawful order was not in accordance with the law under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(c). Mr. Gragg was reinstated once more, proving that once in a while, albeit at a considerable emotional and economic cost, the MSPB will respect the requirements of labor (or other) laws and pierce the veil of agency discretion. <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> notwithstanding, the Board does not ordinarily excuse insubordination on the basis of an employee's belief that he may disobey a supervisor's directive to uphold a provision of a negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 43 MSPR 303, 309 (1990) (discharge of preservation packer was warranted for, among other things, insubordinate refusal to leave a designated break area); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 112 MSPR 607, 617-18 &#x00B6; 15, 2009 MSPB 220 (2009) ("even if the appellant believed that the order was improper because bargaining had not been completed, he was required to first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gragg</span> illustrates the problem of a conflict of wills and a conflict of interpretation of laws and remedies. The FLRA more readily finds a violation of labor law, but its remedial authority can be limited to a cease and desist order. The Board, with more remedial authority, is not a champion of the labor relations provisions of the Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee reasonably believed that a meeting scheduled with management could lead to discipline. He requested a union representative. The local union president could not attend but another representative was available. The appellant would not accept representation by the other official. By refusing to proceed with the meeting under those circumstances, the employee was guilty of insubordination and the employer breached no law or collective bargaining agreement provision by insisting that the employee proceed with the meeting. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 1, 3 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unusual cases such as <span class="Italic">Gragg</span> aside, employees should obey directives and challenge them later. The Federal Circuit concurs. <span class="Italic">Bigelow v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 962, 965-66 (Fed. Cir. 1984), involved two SSA employees who were union officials in a large bargaining unit in New York City. There was a dispute as to their entitlement to "official time"--the paid time granted by the government to employees serving as union officials performing representational work for members of the bargaining unit. The collective bargaining agreement governing the work of the two officials had changed and SSA felt that the new contract limited the official time available for the employees. SSA attempted to impose regular duties (including refresher training) on the employees. They resisted and complained that they should be permitted to perform their normal allocation of union-related work. Eventually, when neither side yielded during the controversy over official time, the men were fired for absence without leave. They grieved their dismissals. The two cases were heard by different arbitrators who reached the same result: the men were insubordinate for refusing the directives to perform regular work and that insubordination called for discipline. The agency, however, was unreasonable in its harsh treatment of the men. They should have been granted leave without pay to perform their union duties (a decision reached under another arbitration award), so they deserved to be reinstated. The arbitrators ordered the men reinstated without back pay. The two employees took their case to the appeals court. The court noted that the arbitrators held that the prior arbitration award converting the absence without leave to leave without pay did not retroactively validate the insubordinate refusal to perform regular work. The court said of the employees' conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appropriate procedure for the petitioners to have followed would have been to obey the retraining order and to file a grievance challenging the Administration's interpretation of their right to official time under the national agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners attempt to draw an analogy between this case and decisions of the Court of Claims holding that an employee may not be disciplined for refusing to accept a reassignment that is illegal because it was intended to discipline the employee or to compel him to resign, or was not in the interest of the service. <span class="Italic">Comberiate v. United States</span>, 203 Ct. Cl. 285 (1973); <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. United States</span>, 145 Ct. Cl. 632 (1959). In the present case, however, the orders the petitioners refused to obey were lawful, and the petitioners could not disobey the orders because of their own view of the legality or propriety of the direction."...&#8197;[T]he employee has no right simply to walk out; he must accept the orders of his superior, even if felt to be unjust, until relieved of them by judicial or administrative action. <span class="Italic">Rosado v. Santiago</span>, 562 F.2d 114, 119 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an analogy is invoked, a more appropriate one would be to the rule the Supreme Court announced in <span class="Italic">United States v. United Mine Workers of America</span>, 330 U.S. 258 (1947), that an order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and person must be obeyed (on pain of criminal contempt) until it is reversed by appropriate proceedings, even though the law under which the order is issued is later found unconstitutional or the order is otherwise set aside on appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the Administration's order that the petitioners undergo training was not unlawful on its face or not a clear and direct violation of a provision of the collective bargaining agreement....&#8197;From the petitioners' point of view, the most that could be said was that they had an arguable position that under the national agreement they still were entitled to spend all their time on union business. In the situation their refusal to undergo the ordered retraining was insubordinate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who challenges a work practice before the FLRA must accept the result. If an employee challenges an instruction through a ULP charge with the FLRA, and the ULP charge is not sustained by the Authority, the employee is considered to be on notice of the validity of the agency policy that he has unsuccessfully challenged. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2091) (a challenge to instructions concerning the completion of leave forms).
