<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-61"><span class="space">f.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span></span>: Disability Established Without Unduly Detailed Medical Causation Analysis</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 619, 627 (1996), The Board may make the connection between an employee's medical condition and that employee's inability to perform work if all the evidence, rather than specific statements in the medical reports or testimony, clearly establishes the connection between the disabling condition and the inability to perform in the position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the nexus between the appellant's psychological impairment and her ability to perform the specific duties of her position, the Board has stated that a physician's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the physician explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">E.g., Tanious v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 104, 111 (1987). This is not a case, however, where the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement turned on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements. The medical reports of Drs. Sahandy and McDonald, which were credible and consistent with one another, confirmed the appellant's personal account as to the extent of her disability. According to these reports and her personal account, the appellant was unable to leave her home, see visitors, drive, and had great difficulty managing ordinary household tasks such as cooking and doing laundry. She was also taking medication that dulled her mind, made her unable to concentrate, and shortened her attention span. Under these circumstances, it was unnecessary for her doctors to have a detailed understanding of the appellant's specific duties as a GS-13 Computer Specialist (Programmer) in order to render an opinion that the appellant's psychological condition rendered her unable to perform successfully in her position. We further note that OPM had a copy of the appellant's position description when it denied the appellant's application for disability retirement. Given the medical reports and the appellant's personal account of the effects of her psychological condition, OPM was in a position to conclude that the appellant's condition precluded her from performing her job duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> "exception" was described in <span class="Italic">Bynum v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 1, 6-8 &#x00B6; 13-16 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Bynum</span> requirement of "unambiguously and without contradiction" overruled in <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HENDERSON_CLARISA_HICKS_DC_831E_10_0812_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_686198.pdf">117 MSPR 313</a>, 319-23 &#x00B6; 11-20, 2012 MSPB 11 (2012)), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While OPM correctly cites the standard for rebutting the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption, there are limited circumstances under which such a specific showing is not required. In <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996), for example, an employee who was a computer programmer applied for disability retirement based on depression and acute anxiety. Her medical reports stated that she was unable to leave her home or talk to anyone other than her family and that she was unable to concentrate to the point of being unable to sort the laundry or cook without fear of setting the house on fire. OPM initially denied her application on the ground that the evidence failed to demonstrate how her psychological impairments prevented her from performing the specific duties of her position. On her appeal, OPM reversed its decision and the appellant sought attorney fees. In discussing whether the appellant had demonstrated that an award of fees would be in the interest of justice, the Board pointed out that an employee's entitlement to disability retirement does not always "turn[&#8197;] on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements." The Board found that OPM was in a position to conclude that the appellant's condition precluded her from performing her job duties based on the position description, the medical reports, and the appellant's personal account of the effects of her psychological condition. The Board awarded attorney fees to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See also Chappell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 302 (1998) (despite failure of employee and her doctors to more explicitly link the claims based on the overall effect of her physical and mental conditions on her ability to perform useful and efficient service, the Board found the record sufficiently demonstrated likelihood of a causal relationship between those conditions and remanded for further development of the issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> approach creates an exception to the rule that medical evidence itself must show that the medical condition affects specific job duties and requirements. Where the Board is presented with the position description and with medical evidence that unambiguously and without contradiction indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties or <span id="Page_4172"></span>meet the requirements of the position, the Board may link the medical evidence to the job duties and requirements and find that the appellant is entitled to disability retirement. In such circumstances, the Board may make this finding in the absence of reference in the medical evidence to specific job duties or requirements. Considering medical evidence in this way is part of the Board's role as the ultimate decision maker with the authority to independently evaluate the probative value of medical evidence in the absence of contradictory medical evidence from another source. <span class="Italic">Irlanda v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 289, 291 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The situation presented in this case falls within the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception. Dr. Prakash Ettigi was the appellant's psychiatrist whom she consulted after being treated by an orthopedist and a neurologist. In Dr. Ettigi's report of July 23, 1997, he diagnosed the appellant as suffering from "depression secondary to obsessive compulsive disorder" due to preoccupation with her physical ailments. He determined that her prognosis was "questionable at the present time." As a Rehabilitation Technician, the appellant worked with alcohol and drug-dependent clients. Her duties included observing symptoms of drug and alcohol withdrawal and related nervous disorders, counseling clients in individual and group settings, and otherwise directing their therapy. An express requirement of her position is that she possess "emotional stability." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although in his report Dr. Ettigi improperly identified the appellant as having served as a "supervisor in maintenance," and did not expressly indicate how her medical condition affected her ability to perform the specific duties of her position, <span class="Italic">id</span>., his diagnosis of depression and obsessive compulsive disorder with a questionable prognosis constitutes evidence that the appellant is not emotionally stable, and thus cannot meet a specific requirement of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retains the ultimate burden of persuasion at all times to establish her entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 527 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In this case, she met that burden because the medical evidence unambiguously indicates that her medical condition as diagnosed by her psychiatrist renders her unable to meet the requirement of her position that she be emotionally stable. <span class="Italic">Compare Wilkey-Marzin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (1999) (evidence of the appellant's post-traumatic stress disorder did not indicate how the disorder affected the performance of her duties as a Letter Carrier); <span class="Italic">Kibble v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (medical evidence that the appellant suffered from major depression did not indicate how her condition affected her ability to perform in her position of Inventory Management Specialist).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the evidence of disability for basic life functions is sufficiently strong, the disability may be established without evidence of the appellant's specific duties in his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Surma v. OPM</span>, 90 MSPR 98, 105 &#x00B6; 16 (2001) (depression and other problems).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Emphasizing an approach that considers all the evidence of record, rather than artificially distinguishing one type of evidence from another based on the degree and completeness of medical documentation in disability retirement cases, the Board modified or overruled <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and discussed earlier law in <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HENDERSON_CLARISA_HICKS_DC_831E_10_0812_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_686198.pdf">117 MSPR 313</a>, 315-25 &#x00B6; 2-27, 2012 MSPB 11 (2012), emphasizing that "[T]he Board has always stated that it will consider all pertinent evidence in determining an appellant's entitlement to disability retirement: objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, and evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on her ability to perform the duties of her position":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, 49-years old, is a 25-year employee of the U.S. Postal Service who applied for disability retirement from her position as a PS-6 Sales and Service Associate. She based her application on her ongoing intolerance to heat, explaining that she is unable to diffuse internal heat due to nerve damage throughout her body, and so can stand temperatures only in the low-to-mid 60s. She stated that, when she becomes overheated, she becomes nauseated and dizzy and cannot think, that she experiences an extremely rapid heart rate at temperatures over 70 degrees, and that she will "pass out" if the external heat cannot be regulated, but that, since it is Postal policy to keep the temperature at 78 degrees, for her, there is no relief anywhere. She added that she must keep her house at "60 degrees to vacuum and [that] sitting around temperature is about 62-63 [degrees]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her application, the appellant submitted extensive medical documentation, including an entire file of reports and test results from Robert C. Blackwood, M.D., her personal care physician. Dr. Blackwood noted at the outset of his period of care that, according to the appellant, she "has been having heat intolerance" since 1991, that it "consists of air on 67 all day long, even in winter," and that "over 70 wants to throw up." Dr. Blackwood also noted the appellant's other symptoms including chest pain, dizziness, exhaustion, and headaches, and he ordered a stress test, echocardiogram, and full blood workup. He subsequently ordered further testing, including a liver ultrasound and a neuroendocrine workup. He also referred the appellant to Dr. Aaron I. Vinik, Director of Research at the Eastern Virginia Medical School Strelitz Diabetes Center and Center for Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders, who first saw the appellant on November 26, 2008. Dr. Vinik ordered a comprehensive metabolic profile and at least a dozen other tests. The appellant continued to complain of heat intolerance and various other symptoms, prompting Dr. Vinik to do a "lupus workup...with immunoelectrophoresis and protein electrophoresis to rule out any Raynaud's phenomenon." During subsequent visits, Dr. Vinik consistently acknowledged the appellant's continued heat intolerance, which did not seem to respond to any prescribed regimen. He ultimately diagnosed her as suffering from, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, autonomic nerve dysfunction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM initially denied the appellant's application, finding that her claimed heat intolerance was totally subjective and unsubstantiated and that "no answer to this symptom has been found." OPM found the appellant's several diagnoses, including autonomic nerve dysfunction, to be unproven.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her April 16, 2010 request for reconsideration, the appellant submitted additional medical documentation in support of her claim. She submitted an October 2, 2008 report from Dr. Paul Mansheim, Riverpoint Psychiatric Associates, who reported that she consulted him for her symptom of feeling hot all of the time, noting that, according to her, she had had numerous medical evaluations with no results. The appellant also submitted a report from Dr. Donald Holzer, Center for Pain Management, whom she saw for evaluation of her heat intolerance. Dr. Holzer noted Dr. Vinik's diagnosis of autonomic neuropathy and suggested that the appellant be evaluated for that condition and hypohidrosis (inability to sweat normally, also known as anhidrosis).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with its earlier denial, OPM denied the appellant's request for reconsideration, finding that her medical records did not support a finding that her conditions had worsened or precluded her from attending the workplace or performing useful and efficient service in her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After filing her appeal, the appellant submitted additional reports. She also explained her abnormal sweating response whereby she does not perspire on her head or face, but does so unevenly on other parts of her torso, with the result that her body is unable to properly cool itself. Dr. Blackwood noted the appellant's continued heat intolerance, but indicated that "[w]e have to this day, not been able to come up with a diagnosis other than some autonomic dysfunction." The appellant also submitted a report from Dr. Kamal Chemali, Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute, who diagnosed her as suffering from a small fiber neuropathy which "probably can explain her lack of sweating," although he indicated that the exact cause of the neuropathy could not be determined. And, the appellant submitted statements from three of her friends who described how her condition has adversely affected her quality of life.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the hearing, the appellant submitted an additional report from Dr. Chemali who certified the appellant's diagnosis as an autonomic small fiber neuropathy of unknown cause, resulting in impairment of her sweating abilities and intolerance to normal room temperatures. Dr. Chemali stated that there is no known treatment for this condition, except avoiding environments where the temperature is greater than 65 degrees "(number noticed by the patient herself)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After weighing the documentary and testimonial evidence, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant had failed to meet her burden of establishing her entitlement to disability retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).[7] The administrative judge acknowledged the appellant's subjective evidence of pain and suffering, but found that she had not presented competent medical evidence in support. The administrative judge referred to specific medical reports from the appellant's various doctors, but found that none indicated how her impairments prevented her from doing her job. He also found that she failed to explain how her psychological condition precluded her from performing her duties or why her problems were not capable of being controlled with medication and therapy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We note that certain evidence the agency submitted suggests that the appellant retired under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). However, the agency stipulated that the appellant met the statutory condition for length of service for retirement under the CSRS, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), and has not challenged the administrative judge's finding in accord. Under the circumstances, we cannot determine definitively which retirement system applies in this case. However, our inability to make such a finding does not affect the appellant's entitlement to a retirement annuity inasmuch as the applicable statutory and regulatory standards governing disability retirement under the CSRS and FERS are essentially identical. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly required that a specific label be attached to her condition since she clearly demonstrated that she cannot perform useful and efficient service due <span id="Page_4173"></span>to her need for 60 degree temperatures at all times. The appellant further argues that the administrative judge improperly required her to establish that her condition precludes her from performing specific requirements of her position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The only rules governing entitlement to disability retirement are the ones set out in statute and regulation.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has frequently stated that a medical provider's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the provider explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">E.g., Tan-Gatue v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 9 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 52 Fed. Appx. 511 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Tanious v.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619 (1996), the Board was presented with a disability retirement appeal by a computer programmer who suffered from depression and anxiety following an automobile accident. Her condition rendered her unable to leave her home, see visitors, or drive, and she had great difficulty managing ordinary household tasks such as cooking and doing laundry. <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 627. In denying the appellant's motion for attorney fees,[10] the administrative judge found that the medical evidence at the time of OPM's initial denial of benefits failed to demonstrate how her psychological impairments prevented her from performing the specific duties of her position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 625. Reversing that finding, the Board observed that "[t]his is not a case, however, where the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement turned on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 627.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;During adjudication of Ms. Mullins-Howard's appeal, following OPM's denial of her application for disability retirement, OPM reversed its earlier finding and concluded that she was entitled to benefits, whereupon the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 624.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 (2001), the Board stated that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> approach creates an exception to the rule that <span class="Italic">medical evidence itself must show that the medical condition affects specific job duties and requirements</span>.

Considering medical evidence in this way is part of the Board's role as the ultimate decision maker with the authority to independently evaluate the probative value of medical evidence in the absence of contradictory medical evidence from another source.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board did not state in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> that it was creating an exception to a general rule, nor that medical evidence must be unambiguous and without contradiction. Nor did several subsequent cases that followed <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard. See Detwiler v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this point, a number of cases decided subsequent to <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> have relied upon it for the proposition that, in proving a claim of entitlement to disability retirement, the "general" rule requires the appellant to show a nexus between her medical condition and her specific job duties, and the "exception" to that rule, sometimes called the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception, allows the Board to link the medical evidence to the job duties where such evidence unambiguously and without contradiction indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties or meet the requirements of her position.[11] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lydon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 152, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 16 (2007); <span class="Italic">Musser v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Other cases have stated that a correlation between the medical condition and specific job duties is not required when the medical evidence is unambiguous, although they have not additionally stated that it must be without contradiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Surma v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 and <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 627); <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is our view that <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> and its progeny reflect a way of analyzing an appellant's entitlement to disability retirement benefits that is contrary to both statute and regulation. We take this opportunity to explain why, and to now clarify the proper way to analyze such a claim. In so doing, we follow and adopt the reasoning of then-Member Slavet's separate opinion in <span class="Italic">Craig v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 449, 459-64 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), an applicant for disability retirement under CSRS must be "unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position."[12] OPM's implementing regulation explains the statutory requirement as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The individual must, while employed in a position subject to the [CSRS], have become disabled because of a medical condition, resulting in a service deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or if there is no actual service deficiency, the disabling medical condition must be incompatible with either useful or efficient service or retention in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2). The regulation thus sets out two ways to meet the statutory requirement: (1) by showing that the medical condition caused a deficiency in performance, attendance, or conduct; or (2) by showing that the medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in the position. <span class="Italic">See Gometz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 115, 121 (1995) (finding that, although the appellant's disability did not result in a documented service deficiency, it was incompatible with either useful or efficient service or retention in her position). Under the first method, an appellant can establish entitlement by showing that the medical condition affects her ability to perform specific work requirements, or prevented her from being regular in attendance or caused her to act inappropriately. Under the second method, an appellant can establish entitlement by showing that the medical condition is inconsistent with working in general, working in a particular line of work, or working in a particular type of setting. But regardless of the particular method of establishing an inability to render useful and efficient service, the burden of proof in every case is by a preponderance of the evidence, i.e., more likely true than not. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a), (c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b), 1201.4(q)] . To require medical evidence that is unambiguous and without contradiction is to impose a much higher burden of proof, one that is not authorized by law or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The statute additionally provides that an employee is not eligible for disability retirement if she is qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by OPM, to a vacant position in the agency which is at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a). In this instance, the agency certified that reassignment was not possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As then-Member Slavet posited, it appears that the source of confusion in this matter may have begun as an observation about the probative value of expert opinion evidence, which was later viewed as a substantive rule governing entitlement to disability retirement. The <span class="Italic">Tanious/Tan-Gatue</span> line of decisions focuses on the persuasiveness of a medical provider's opinion as to a patient's disability. <span class="Italic">See Tan-Gatue</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Tanious</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. at 111. But in <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, the focus shifted to the content of the medical evidence itself. <span class="Italic">See Bynum</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 ("medical evidence itself must show that the medical condition affects specific job duties and requirements"). The basic idea behind the <span class="Italic">Tanious/Tan-Gatue</span> line of decisions is simply that a medical opinion unsupported by medical evidence, e.g., a diagnosis, clinical findings, etc., is not very persuasive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gonzales v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 46, &#x00B6; 5 (where a psychologist opined that the appellant was mentally incompetent but provided no facts or explanation to support his opinion, the Board found that the psychologist's opinion on the issue of the appellant's mental incompetence was not persuasive), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 48 Fed. Appx. 747 (Fed. Cir. 2002). But to go from that proposition to the proposition that an appellant is not entitled to disability retirement unless her medical provider explains specifically how her medical condition affects specific work requirements is unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore overrule <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> and its progeny to the extent that they state that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> reflects an "exception" to a "general rule" that medical evidence must unambiguously and without contradiction show how the medical condition affects specific job duties or indicate that the appellant cannot meet the requirements of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has always stated that it will consider all pertinent evidence in determining an appellant's entitlement to disability retirement: objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, and evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on her ability to perform the duties of her position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dunn v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 426, 432 (1994), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 91 F.3d 169 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). However, nothing in the law mandates that a single provider tie all of this evidence together. For <span id="Page_4174"></span>example, if the medical provider provides clinical findings, a diagnosis, and a description of how the medical condition affects the appellant's activities in general terms, the Board could consider that evidence, together with the appellant's subjective account of how the condition has affected her ability to do her job and her daily life, testimony or statements from supervisors, co-workers, family members, and friends, and the appellant's position description. From that, the Board could conclude that the medical condition caused deficiencies in the employee's performance, conduct, or attendance, <span class="Italic">or</span> that the medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service in her position, either because the appellant is unable to perform critical elements of her position, <span class="Italic">or</span> because she cannot work at any job, in a particular line of work, or in a particular type of work setting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ultimate question, based on all relevant evidence, is: Do the employee's medical impairments preclude her from rendering useful and efficient service in her position? And this question must be answered in the affirmative if the totality of the evidence makes that conclusion more likely to be true than not true.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established that her medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in her position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the appellant has exhaustively sought treatment from a variety of medical professionals for her numerous medical conditions and symptoms, but with little or no success. She has been largely compliant, except when certain medications are problematic for her. There has been no suggestion that she is a malingerer. Her account of her debilitating heat intolerance is well corroborated, and her evidence of such is unchallenged by any contradictory evidence. <span class="Italic">See Vanieken-Ryals v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 508 F.3d 1034, 1040-44 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (an appellant is not required to submit objective medical evidence to establish entitlement to disability retirement but may rely on subjective evidence, including the appellant's own description of her own symptoms as reported to a medical professional). Her most recent medical report from Dr. Chemali has provided a diagnosis for her heat intolerance, autonomic small fiber neuropathy, but according to him, there is no known treatment for the condition, except avoiding environments where the temperature is greater than 65 degrees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed record evidence shows that the appellant's condition has deteriorated such that she is significantly limited in her ability to leave her home because it is only there that she can control the temperature. All these individuals supported the appellant's claim as to how her body reacts to temperatures above 65 degrees (her skin gets red and "mottled"; she becomes nauseated and disoriented; she gets headaches; recovery takes 2-3 days). Notably, the administrative judge found the appellant's witnesses to be honest and forthright in their testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant herself testified to her lengthy medical history, including the many and varied diagnoses she has received over the years she has struggled with her health. She explained that her heat intolerance and other conditions, with their accompanying symptoms, leave her exhausted and depressed. The administrative judge found the appellant to be credible. It is well established that subjective evidence, i.e., testimony or written statements regarding symptoms that is submitted by the applicant, "may be entitled to great weight on the matter of disability, especially where such evidence is uncontradicted by the record." <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 422 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Biscaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 304, 309 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes a job description for the appellant's position as Sales and Service Associate. It requires her to perform distribution and a variety of sales and customer support services for products, maintain pleasant and effective public relations with customers and others, and have a general familiarity with postal laws, regulations, and procedures commonly used. The appellant's duties are performed in a postal "store" at a retail window. Her numerous medical conditions, as attested to by the many physicians she has consulted, are inconsistent with carrying out such responsibilities, notably her documented inability to withstand temperatures over 65 degrees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence from the appellant's supervisor corroborates her claim that she cannot perform her duties in that work environment. Her supervisor certified that she has been absent from work since August 2009. Although absences from work do not conclusively establish that an employee is incapable of rendering useful and efficient service, they are nonetheless a factor worthy of consideration in judging disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Moran v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 138, 142-43 (1996). In addition, the appellant's supervisor certified that the agency was unable to accommodate the appellant "due to operational paremeters [sic] concerning temperature."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show how her psychological condition precluded her from performing her duties or why her problems were not capable of being controlled with medication or therapy, suggesting that "[i]t would appear from the record that [the appellant] would benefit from such treatment." The administrative judge relied upon an October 2, 2008 clinical evaluation during which it was noted that the appellant "was at first not very happy with the idea of psychiatric referral." Dr. Mansheim, the psychiatrist to whom the appellant was referred, diagnosed her as suffering from dysthymic disorder, but recommended only that she change from Wellbutrin, two tablets per day, for depression, to the "once a day Wellbutrin," and stated that she was amenable to that change. Dr. Mansheim made no further recommendations. None of the many other physicians the appellant consulted has recommended that she undergo therapy. Thus, we see no basis upon which to find that her failure to do so precludes her from receiving disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Treziok</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that the appellant has shown that she cannot render useful and efficient service in her particular work environment, and that she has therefore met her burden of establishing an entitlement to disability retirement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, in affirming OPM's reconsideration decision, the administrative judge applied the "general" rule to find that the appellant failed to submit persuasive medical evidence explaining how his medical conditions preclude him from performing his specific job duties. However, the Board has recently overruled a line of cases that indicated that there is a "general" rule that such evidence is required to prove entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Henderson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> the Board noted that, under the Civil Service Retirement System, OPM's implementing regulation describes two ways to meet the statutory requirement that the employee "be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position": (1) by showing that the medical condition caused a deficiency in performance, attendance, or conduct; or (2) by showing that the medical condition is incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in the position. <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 16 (citing <span class="Italic">Gometz v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 115, 121 (1995)). The applicable FERS statute and implementing regulation contain the same relevant language, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(2), and we discern no basis not to apply the holding in <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> to disability retirement cases under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the first method discussed above, an appellant can establish entitlement by showing that his medical condition affects his ability to perform specific work requirements, prevents him from being regular in attendance, or causes him to act inappropriately. <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 16. Under the second method, an appellant can show that the medical condition is inconsistent with working in general, working in a particular line of work, or working in a particular type of setting.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Regardless of the particular method of establishing an inability to render useful and efficient service, the burden of proof in every case is by a preponderance of the evidence, i.e., more likely true than not. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a), (c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b), 1201.4(q)] . The Board specifically found that to require medical evidence that is unambiguous and without contradiction is to impose a higher burden of proof, one that is not authorized by law or regulation. <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 16. The Board concluded that the ultimate question, based on all the relevant evidence, is whether the appellant's medical impairments preclude him from rendering useful and efficient service in his position, and that the question must be answered in the affirmative if the totality of the evidence makes that conclusion more likely to be true than not true. <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge did not have the benefit of <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> because it was issued after the initial decision in this case. Therefore, we find it is necessary to remand this appeal in order to determine whether the appellant has met his burden of establishing his entitlement to disability retirement benefits under <span class="Italic">Henderson.</span></p>

<p class="Body-Text">The decisions that follow applied <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> before <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> and <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> and they provide guidance that is likely useful only when the case reflects an AJ's grant, rather than denial, of a disability annuity application.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), however, the appellant must show not only that she suffers from the medical condition of hypertension, but that the hypertension is disabling, i.e., renders her unable to render useful and efficient service. The AJ found that the condition itself was disabling, without regard to how it affected the appellant's ability to perform the specific duties of her position. But the general and well-settled rule is that "a physician's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the physician explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements." <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 627; <span class="Italic">Tanious v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 107, 111 (1987). The exception to this rule, relied on by the AJ, is to be invoked only in extraordinary circumstances. Those circumstances are where the medical evidence "unambiguously and without contradiction indicates that [the appellant] cannot perform the duties or meet the requirements of [her] position."<span class="Italic"> Bynum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's evidence does not establish that the hypertension alone renders her unable to perform in her position and, thus, that the exception to the general rule should apply. As OPM correctly points out, the evidence shows that, over a period of time, the appellant's blood pressure readings ranged from normal, to pre-hypertensive, to high. Further, the fact that her hypertension might put her at risk of experiencing a disabling condition in the future does not entitle her to disability retirement based on a non-disabling condition. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Phenious v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 15 M.S.P.R. 368, 371 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the general rule to this case, we find that the appellant has failed to establish her entitlement to a disability retirement annuity. As the foregoing testimony reflects, the appellant's physician did not explain how her hypertension affected her ability to perform her specific work requirements. Rather, he relied on the appellant's reports concerning stress at work.<span class="Italic"></span> (the appellant related that working for the Postal Service was "extremely stressful"); (Sept. 17, 2002 letter from Dr. Rosenberg stating that "the occupational stress factors, whether actual or perceived, are a significant factor contributing to the volatile hypertensive state of this patient"). Nevertheless, proof of stress, anxiety, and discomfort at work is not enough by itself to establish disability. An appellant must show that she is unable to perform her job duties in general and not only that she is unable to perform them in the context of what she sees as a hostile environment.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Tan-Gatue v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 15 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 52 Fed. Appx. 511 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Further, the record does not indicate that the appellant's performance was unacceptable before she stopped attending work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Conner v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6; 11 (absence alone is insufficient to establish disability),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 243 F.3d 562 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> was applied as to a combination of physical problems that included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in <span class="Italic">Dussault v. OPM</span>, 103 MSPR 92, 96-98 &#x00B6; 8-14, 2006 MSPB 241 (2006) (<span class="Italic">Bynum</span> requirement of "unambiguously and without contradiction" overruled in <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HENDERSON_CLARISA_HICKS_DC_831E_10_0812_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_686198.pdf">117 MSPR 313</a>, 319-23 &#x00B6; 11-20, 2012 MSPB 11 (2012)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant was removed from her position based on her inability to perform her duties, her removal constitutes <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that she is entitled to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Bruner,</span> 996 F.2d at 294. Under <span class="Italic">Bruner,</span> the burden of production then shifts to OPM to come forward with evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the appellant did not qualify for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 F.3d 520, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Klein v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 366, 370 (1996). OPM can meet its burden of production by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">See Trevan,</span> 69 F.3d at 526-27. If OPM meets its burden of production, the Board then considers the totality of the evidence in deciding the disability issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 527. The appellant retains the burden of persuasion at all times to establish her entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.; Klein,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, there are limited circumstances under which a specific showing from OPM is not required. <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 13 (2001). Under <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996), there is an exception to the rule that the medical evidence itself must show that the medical condition affects specific job duties and requirements. Where the Board is presented with the position description and with medical evidence that unambiguously and without contradiction indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties or meet the requirements of the position, the Board may link the medical evidence to the job duties and requirements and find that the appellant is entitled to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Bynum,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14. In such circumstances, the Board may make this finding in the absence of reference in the medical evidence to specific job duties or requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Considering medical evidence in this way is part of the Board's role as the ultimate decision maker with the authority to independently evaluate the probative value of medical evidence in the absence of contradictory medical evidence from another source. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The situation presented in this case falls within the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception. According to the appellant's medical evidence, she suffers from anxiety, depression, asthma, emphysema, COPD, diverticulosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and she had an episode of congestive heart failure (CHF). In a letter dated September 26, 2003, Dr. Charles Seiler, the appellant's primary care physician, confirmed that the appellant suffers from COPD, diverticulosis, GERD, anxiety, and depression. Dr. Seiler prescribed Advair for the appellant's asthma, Protonix for her GERD, and Zoloft for her anxiety and depression.<span class="Italic"></span> Dr. He further stated that a return to work would cause the appellant extreme anxiety and she probably would require further psychotherapy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a letter dated August 10, 2004, Dr. Seiler stated that the appellant's most severe problems were anxiety and depression, and her current medications included Zoloft for her anxiety and depression, as well as medications for her asthma and COPD. Dr. Seiler opined that the appellant has permanent problems, including COPD and anxiety and depression focused on her work situation, and that continued medicine for her COPD and GERD as well as medication and psychotherapy would hopefully keep her stable and eventually improve her quality of life.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the National Institutes of Health, COPD is a lung disease in which the lung is damaged, making it hard to breathe. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, What is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)?, <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Copd/Copd_WhatIs.html">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Copd/Copd_WhatIs.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/copd">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/copd</a>]. In COPD, the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs are partly obstructed, making it difficult to get air in and out.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> While COPD is treatable, it is not curable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to her removal, the appellant was a City Carrier with the agency. City Carriers are responsible for delivery and collection of mail on foot or by vehicle. City Carriers may be required to carry mail in shoulder satchels weighing as much as 35 pounds and to load and unload sacks of mail weighing up to 70 pounds.<span class="Italic"></span> The position requires arduous exertion involving prolonged standing, walking, and reaching, and may involve handling heavy sacks of mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, COPD is chronic and incurable and, on two separate occasions, the appellant's physician stated that she would have difficulty performing some of the duties of her position, such as walking, lifting, or breathing, because of her COPD. The USPS also documented a service deficiency because the appellant was unable to complete her route in eight hours and she required overtime. In addition, the appellant provided documentation that she has been awarded social security benefits as of her last date of work with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Givens v. Office of <span id="Page_4176"></span>Personnel Management,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 120, &#x00B6; 9 (2003) (while not dispositive, a Social Security Administration decision awarding social security benefits is material evidence to be considered by the Board and OPM in disability retirement cases). Therefore, we find that, based on the appellant's position description and medical evidence unambiguously indicating that she cannot perform the essential duties of her position, such as walking or carrying any weight, we can link the medical evidence to her job duties and requirements and find that she is entitled to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Bynum,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 16;<span class="Italic"> Mullins-Howard,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 627.</p>
