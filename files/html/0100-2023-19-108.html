<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-104"><span id="Page_3525"></span><span class="space">a.</span> Unreasonable Accommodation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An accommodation must be reasonable. The Board evaluates requested accommodations through an analysis of reasonableness and burden. In <span class="Italic">Widger v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 368, 371-73 (1988), involving the removal of a housekeeping aid for AWOL, and a defense based on disabling post-traumatic stress disorder, the Board considered to be unreasonable the appellant's suggestion of elastic scheduling or reassignment. Reasonable accommodation did not include unscheduled leave for an appellant. The agency demonstrated that work schedules throughout a department would need to be revised and that unscheduled LWOP resulted in both the complete inability to plan on an employee's presence and the constant rescheduling of other employees' work assignments, with the possible failure to complete those assignments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination. The appellant has shown that he is a handicapped person by establishing that he has a psychological condition that substantially limits a major life activity: his ability to work. As the administrative judge found, the parties stipulated that the appellant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition which causes him to miss work. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a)(1); (b)(2); (c). He has also made at least a facial showing that his handicap can be accommodated by suggesting that he be placed in a position where he could take unscheduled leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency rebutted this <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that the appellant is not a qualified handicapped person. Specifically, the agency has shown that the appellant could not be reasonably accommodated because accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency. The issues raised in this regard involve whether the agency could have accommodated the appellant in his position as a Housekeeping Aid or whether it could have accommodated him by reassigning him to another position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's suggested accommodation for his handicap in the Housekeeping Aid position is essentially to restructure the entire department's work schedules to allow him to take unscheduled leave whenever his condition requires it. As the agency pointed out, however, unscheduled LWOP results in the complete inability to plan on an employee's presence, requires constant rescheduling of other employees' work assignments to cover the absent employee's duties, and may result in failure to complete work assignments. Therefore, we find that the agency has shown that unscheduled leave does not constitute a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Krainz v. Department of the Army,</span> 33 MSPR 554, 556 (1987); <span class="Italic">Clancy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 MSPB 173, 6 MSPR 196, 199-200 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that he should have been offered reassignment to a different position, noting that he testified that he did not have a leave problem when he worked as a Groundskeeper. To begin with, regardless of the appellant's previous leave record, he asked to be reassigned out of the Groundskeeper position because of a conflict with his supervisor and because he wanted to attend school. Further, although he mentioned the position at the hearing, he did not specifically suggest reassignment to this position as a reasonable accommodation until filing his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the evidence does not show that the appellant's attendance would improve in any other position. The appellant testified only that he thought his attendance "could" improve. The November 22, 1985 psychosocial evaluation and treatment summary submitted by the appellant states that his condition will continue for an indefinite period. Further, two witnesses stated that the appellant's therapist thought the appellant's problem would continue and that the appellant's employment with the agency in general, not his employment in a particular position, was causing him stress. Indeed, the appellant himself stated in his petition for appeal that his symptoms were more severe when he was under pressure, especially when the pressure represents the source of his original trauma, "...i.e., VA facility representing my experiences in Vietnam." Therefore, we find that the agency rebutted the appellant's suggested accommodation of reassignment to the Groundskeeper position as unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Krainz,</span> 33 MSPR at 556.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge did not specifically address that portion of the reassignment issue which may be taken as an assertion that other positions could accommodate the appellant's requested unscheduled attendance. The appellant appears to argue that shifts having more employees would be able to tolerate the unscheduled absences, but there is no evidence to support this allegation and no basis for concluding that frequent unscheduled leave could be accommodated in any position. As the Board has recognized, an employer faced with an unscheduled absence is doubly burdened; once for the loss of the employee's services and, again, for the loss of the opportunity to plan for the absence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fleming v. United States Postal Service,</span> 30 MSPR 302, 308 (1986). Furthermore, the agency does not have special funding for creating jobs or schedules which might accommodate the appellant's unscheduled absences. The nature and cost of a proposed accommodation are legitimate factors to consider in determining whether it would impose an undue hardship on the agency. <span class="Italic">See Savage,</span> 36 MSPR at 153. Therefore, we conclude that the agency has shown that the appellant's suggested accommodations would impose an undue hardship on its operations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as previously noted, the appellant must be given an opportunity to show that the agency's action is a pretext for handicap discrimination. The appellant, however, has offered nothing that would support a finding of pretext.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">LWOP with no foreseeable end would not be a reasonable accommodation if it caused others to work unreasonable hours to compensate for the absence of an employee receiving OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 43 MSPR 558, 564-65 (1990) (deputy regional director was removed for the physical inability to perform a position based on medical statements establishing that the appellant was unable to perform his duties, that his period of incapacity was indefinite, and that his absence placed undue hardship on other employees who had to perform the appellant's work). However, the Family Medical Leave Act authorizes extended leave for various disabling conditions if the requirements of the Act [discussed in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-025.html#sec8-26">Family Leave</a>"] are met. If the agency should have granted leave to a disabled employee instead of removing the individual for AWOL or inability to perform job duties, the removal will likely be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 80 (1997) [discussed in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-291.html#sec8-289">Performance as Basis for Adverse Action</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-15-318.html#sec8-296">Medical Inability to Perform</a>"].Release from a requirement to produce medical justification for absences was not a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burnette v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 230, 232 (1982). Extended absence without authorization and verification was not proper accommodation. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 20 MSPR 391, 394 (1984) (an absence of one year).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency has no duty to accommodate if a personality disorder causes disruption in the workplace to the extent that it impairs the work of other employees and impairs the supervisor-employee relationship. <span class="Italic">Dazey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 658, 660-64 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mazzarella v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 47, 55-56 (1992) (noted earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-19-078.html#sec12-74">Qualified Disabled Employee</a>") .<span class="Italic">Dazey</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 10, 1991, the agency removed the appellant from her position as a GS-12 auditor based on charges of: (1) using abusive and offensive language; (2) making malicious/threatening remarks against fellow employees and her supervisor; and (3) inappropriate/immoral behavior in the office....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant does not challenge the administrative judge's finding that she is a handicapped employee because her bizarre behavior at work, due to her manic depressive illness, ultimately led to her removal and foreclosed her employment in any line of work. She specifically challenges the administrative judge's further finding that she is not a "qualified handicapped employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, the appellant asserts that the deposition of her psychiatrist, Dr. William Freeman, and his hearing testimony show that she can perform the essential functions of her job, without endangering the health and safety of herself or others, whether with or without reasonable accommodation. Thus, the appellant contends that the administrative judge inaccurately evaluated the evidence and substituted her judgment for that of Dr. Freeman in concluding to the contrary. The appellant refers to various portions of Dr. Freeman's deposition and to the hearing testimony in support of her argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988), the Board held that, although the necessary elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination will vary according to the particular facts and circumstances at issue, they generally include: a showing that the person is a qualified handicapped person and that the action appealed was based on his handicap; and, to the extent possible, an articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant was not a "qualified handicapped person," the administrative judge noted that, at about the time of her removal, the appellant was diagnosed by Dr. Freeman, a new treating psychiatrist, as suffering from manic depression, and not from major depression. In December of 1991, Dr. Freeman placed the appellant on lithium, in combination with prozac. The administrative judge rejected the appellant's contention that, because of appropriate medication, her behavior will no longer be bizarre or disruptive if she is returned to work without any accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge considered all of the evidence of record and appropriately explained her findings and credibility determinations in the initial decision<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987). There is nothing in the petition which persuades us to disturb the administrative judge's factual findings and credibility determinations. In addition, the administrative judge relied on demeanor evidence. She found significant the fact that the appellant <span id="Page_3526"></span>exhibited mood changes at the hearing and continued to exhibit an apparently irrational dislike for her supervisor. The administrative judge concluded that the appellant could therefore perform the essential functions of her position only after extensive treatment.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although the petition for review asserts that the appellant was not a danger to the health or safety of herself or others, the administrative judge did not reach this issue. The administrative judge found that the appellant could not perform the essential functions of her position because such essential functions included not engaging in the bizarre behavior previously engaged in, and getting along with her supervisor. Thus, whether the appellant is a danger to the health or safety of others is not dispositive of the issue of whether the appellant is a "qualified handicapped person."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Affording special deference to the administrative judge's findings based on the demeanor of witnesses, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985), we find that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the appellant was not a qualified handicapped employee entitled to the reasonable accommodation of being permitted to return to work<span class="Italic">. See Pickut v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> 24 MSPR 433, 435 (1984) (there is no duty to accommodate an employee who is not a "qualified handicapped person").[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Rand v. Stone</span>, EEOC Pet. No. 03920005, slip op. at 6-7 (Jan. 30, 1992) (there is no duty to accommodate where personality disorder causes disruption in workplace); <span class="Italic">De La Cruz v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 51 MSPR 610, 613 (1991) (there is no duty to accommodate appellant's severe depression); <span class="Italic">Brunda</span> <span class="Italic">v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that the agency violated the provisions of Air Force Regulation (AFR) 40-750, which provides that "[a]dverse action based on an employee's physical or mental handicap is not taken when the employee can effectively perform assigned duties." The appellant asserts that her satisfactory performance of her auditor duties was never in question and, thus, in removing her, the agency violated this regulation and committed harmful procedural error. Because the administrative judge did not specifically address this matter, we do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proof on the affirmative defense of harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force,</span> 47 MSPR 672, 685 (1991). Reversal of an action for harmful procedural error is warranted only where the procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, the appellant's representative questioned the agency's deciding official as to why he decided to remove the appellant, despite the regulatory prohibition set forth above. The deciding official testified that, based upon the evidence before him, he did not believe that the appellant was handicapped. At the hearing, nothing further was elicited concerning the deciding official's interpretation of the regulation, particularly its ramifications where, as here, the employee is handicapped. Thus, we must rely on our interpretation of the regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that the appellant's performance of her specific auditor duties was never in question, the agency removed her for misconduct at the workplace which was disruptive to the work of other employees and to the supervisor-employee relationship. The Air Force Regulation at issue refers to being able to "effectively perform assigned duties." We deem it axiomatic that one cannot "effectively perform assigned duties," if one engages in misconduct which is disruptive to the work of other employees in the workplace and to the supervisor-employee relationship. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rand v. Stone,</span> EEOC Pet. No. 03920005, slip op. at 6-7 (Jan. 30, 1992) (no duty to accommodate where a personality disorder causes disruption in the workplace); <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 8 MSPR 624, 635 (1981) (assuming the appellant was a "qualified handicapped person," a propensity to disruptive behavior could not be reasonably accommodated). Thus, we find that the agency action removing the appellant is not violative of AFR 40-750, section A1b. Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant did not establish that the agency committed harmful procedural error in removing her.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Accommodation for an employee allergic to smoke was considered in <span class="Italic">Pletten v. Dept. of Army</span>, 7 MSPR 13, 16-17, 6 MSPB 626 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd on remand from EEOC</span>, <span class="Italic">Pletten v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 682, 686 (1984), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Holder v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 469, 471 (1986) (creation of a totally smoke-free environment would impose an undue hardship on agency operations). The 1981 <span class="Italic">Pletten</span> decision determined the employer's response to be reasonable even though it did not alleviate the appellant's difficulties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that appellant is a handicapped employee. The only issue remaining to be addressed is whether he is able to perform the duties of his position with reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant and his personal physician have articulated several actions which they believe the agency should take to enable appellant to perform the essential functions of the position in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's physician advised the agency that "reasonable accommodation" would include "a smoke-free eating area, rest room facilities, and work area where his job takes him throughout the day." Appellant, in addition to what in essence amounts to an installation-wide ban on smoking, requested, among other things, a continuing anti-smoking campaign featuring lectures, films, pamphlets and posters; the suspension and removal of all smokers; instructions to the on-base marshall to arrest all smokers on the installation; the exclusion from the installation of all smokers and cigarettes; a request by the Commanding Officer to all area police departments and prosecutors for assistance in arresting smokers; and an adequate ventilation system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency response to the petition for review states that its action was reasonable and proper under the circumstances. The agency's efforts to accommodate appellant's allergy condition included conducting an air content study of appellant's immediate work area to determine toxic substances present; prohibiting smoking in the entire Civilian Personnel Division; relocating his office to improve air quality; initiating an educational program to discourage smoking within the general workforce; posting notices banning smoking in areas such as elevators, auditoriums, appellant's office and cafeterias; conducting periodic air quality surveys of appellant's immediate work area to insure compliance with health standards; and advising fellow workers and visitors not to smoke in appellant's presence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contended however, that it could not provide appellant a "smoke-free" environment ordered by his physician, and, for that reason, it placed appellant on sick leave. The agency's duty to accommodate is not unlimited. All that is required by statute is a "reasonable" attempt to accommodate appellant's handicapping condition. 29 CFR 1613.704. Furthermore, even if the agency's argument of impossibility of appellant's suggested accommodation cannot be substantiated, we conclude that performance of the requested conditions would constitute an "undue hardship" not legally required to be provided by the agency. Therefore, the Board finds that the agency made reasonable efforts to accommodate appellant's allergy condition by improving his surrounding working environment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On reconsideration following remand from EEOC, the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Pletten</span> that because the work site was a large one, and because the appellant's duties took him throughout a large area used by many employees, it was unrealistic to require others to forego smoking to accommodate the appellant. A smoking ban would be difficult to enforce; the rights of smokers were to be balanced against those of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Pletten v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 682, 686 n.5 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 212, 212 n.* (1985) (noting that the appellant did not show that her absence from work resulted from intolerance of tobacco smoke; there was no evidence that the agency's offer to segregate smokers and nonsmokers at the work site would not have accommodated the appellant sufficiently to allow her to return to work); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Henry v. VA</span>, 108 MSPR 458, 462-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-23, 2008 MSPB 77 (2008) (discussed in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-178.html#sec16-174">Reinstatement with Accommodation for Disability</a>," concerning the cost to reinstate an employee to a job and modify equipment, rather than reassign the employee, to accommodate the appellant's disability).
