<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-153"><span class="space">g.</span> Dismissal Initiated by Judge or MSPB</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Even before the 2012 regulation, an AJ could direct the dismissal without the consent or over the opposition of the appellant unless demonstrable prejudice resulted. <span class="Italic">Neubeiser v. FERC</span>, 47 MSPR 125, 127-28 (1991), involved an adjudication delay caused by the need to obtain an advisory opinion from OPM concerning a complication of RIF law. The AJ, deciding that the case needed additional adjudication after receipt of the OPM opinion, determined that adjudication of the appeal could not be completed within the 120-day Board deadline and entered a DWOP--restarting the 120-day adjudication period after the case was refiled. The appellant's PFR unsuccessfully challenged the DWOP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously found that dismissals for short periods of time are appropriate to avoid lengthy postponements, and are in accordance with the Board's policy of processing cases in an expeditious manner while still ensuring appropriate consideration of unforeseeable circumstances....&#8197;Further, the Board has explicitly approved of dismissals without prejudice as an alternative to granting lengthy and indefinite continuances that would result in an administrative judge's failure to comply with the 120-day adjudication policy....&#8197;The Board has also held that administrative judges have wide discretion in determining whether to dismiss an appeal without prejudice....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant asserts that the Board's 120-day adjudication policy did not require dismissal, and that such dismissal will cause him additional expense and a delayed adjudication, the appellant has failed to establish that the expense and delay is in any way onerous or that the administrative judge abused his discretion with respect to this matter. Moreover, even if the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal, the appellant has not shown how this adjudicatory error affected his substantive rights because he could--and did--file another appeal of the same matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A DWOP was properly entered by the AJ over the appellant's opposition, <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 258, 261-62 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge is required to conduct fair and impartial hearings. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b). Thus, an administrative judge has broad discretion in controlling proceedings before him. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(a)-.41(b). Dismissal of an appeal without prejudice is a procedural option that is committed to the sound discretion of the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Padilla v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 561, 564 (1993); <span class="Italic">Zell v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 86, 87 (1993); <span class="Italic">Keene v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 47 MSPR 41, 44 (1991). Thus, an administrative judge has the discretion to dismiss an appeal without prejudice to refiling where an appeal cannot be fairly adjudicated within the Board's 120-day time limit for processing appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Neubeiser v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 47 MSPR 125, 126-27 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the administrative judge based his finding that the parties could not be guaranteed a fair hearing under the Board's established 120-day time limit for adjudicating appeals on the following factors: (1) Consumption of the first 4 months of the appeal proceeding "by a number of motions and replies dealing with various complex legal issues"; (2) existing outstanding discovery motions by both parties; and (3) the appellant's counsel's imminent commencement of a lengthy trial. We find that these reasons were sufficient to support the administrative judge's dismissal of the appeal without prejudice with leave to refiling at a later date. <span class="Italic">See Neubeiser</span>, 47 MSPR at 126-27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends, however, that dismissal of his appeal without prejudice was still improper because he alleged below discrimination based on "race, color, sex, and [disabling] condition" and his appeal is, therefore, a mixed-case appeal subject to the 120-day statutory adjudicatory time limit set forth at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)(v). He therefore argues that the expiration of the 120-day time limit for processing his appeal divested the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal. An administrative judge may, however, in the exercise of his adjudicatory discretion, dismiss a mixed case without prejudice to refiling. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 43 MSPR 204, 205-08 (1990). Thus, the Board retains jurisdiction over the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that the appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced by the administrative judge's dismissal of his appeal. The appellant argues that his rights have been prejudiced because he is "out of work, and now out of [c]ourt, and surviving on limited resources until these injustices are corrected." The appellant, however, has not shown that any of these situations is onerous. <span class="Italic">See Neubeiser</span>, 47 MSPR at 128. Neither has he shown that the administrative judge's dismissal of the appeal, even if it was error, prejudiced his substantive rights inasmuch as he was afforded an opportunity to refile his appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, because we find that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal without prejudice to refiling, and there have been no findings on the merits of the appeal, we find that the appellant's challenges of the administrative judge's rulings on his motions are premature. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.</span> at 128-29.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hart v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 279, 281 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (AJ declined to grant "an initial stay" requested by the appellant and instead entered a DWOP; the AJ did not abuse discretion through DWOP providing the appellant's new lawyer a chance to review the records in a pending court case); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 221, 224 (1996) (outstanding discovery as a factor supporting a decision to dismiss without prejudice initiated by the AJ: "[T]he administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in his initial decision dismissing the appeal without prejudice and in his order requiring the appellant to provide the agency with all the medical records discussed at the hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When AJs initiate DWOPs, they should do so rationally, based on nonspeculative events, <span class="Italic">Ballard v. VA</span>, 73 MSPR 598, 600-02 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that, under certain circumstances, the Board has upheld an administrative judge's decision to dismiss an appeal without prejudice even absent the appellant's consent. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hammond v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 263, 264 (1996), the Board held that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing the appellant's appea[l] <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. However, <span class="Italic">Hammond</span> is factually distinguishable from the present case. There, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice to refiling within a short period of time--30 days--of the date of the initial decision. The Board treated the appellant's petition for review of the initial decision as also a refiled petition for appeal and forwarded it to the regional office for adjudication as such. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 264-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, in this case, the administrative judge found that the appellant may refile her appeal within 30 days of "the resolution of the state proceedings." The record contains no evidence or argument, however, that any state licensing board proceedings are underway. Indeed, the record contains no evidence that the agency ever reported the appellant to the state licensing board. With its motion to dismiss the appellant's appeal, the agency enclosed a September 6, 1996 letter to the appellant from Richard S. Droske, Director, VA Western N.Y. Healthcare System. Droske informed the appellant only that the agency was "considering whether" it should report the appellant to the state licensing board and provided her with an opportunity to submit information to the agency on the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant objected to the agency's motion on the grounds that the agency was merely "considering whether" to report her to the state licensing board and that she did not want any such report, if made, to delay the adjudication of her appeal. We also note that the appellant disputes in her petition for review that any proceedings are pending against her before the state licensing board, and the agency's response does not rebut her assertion or claim that it has actually filed a report with the state licensing board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, there is no evidence that the basis for the administrative judge's dismissal--a state licensing board proceeding--has occurred or ever will. The administrative judge's decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal under such circumstances was an abuse of discretion<span class="Italic">. See Walton</span>, 62 MSPR at 296; <span class="Italic">Pidock</span>, 54 MSPR at 30-31; <span class="Italic">Draper</span>, 51 MSPR at 520-21; <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 51 MSPR at 221-22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that a continuance is not warranted in this case. In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 51 MSPR at 221-22, the Board held that whether good cause exists for continuing a hearing is generally determined by the unique circumstances of each case and rests with the sound discretion of the administrative judge. The Board found that the administrative judge should consider the agency's specific reasons in determining whether to grant the agency's request for a continuance. Here, as discussed above, the agency failed to show that its basis for moving to dismiss the appellant's appeal had occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 51 MSPR at 221, the Board also cited other factors to consider in determining whether a continuance should be granted. These include whether the agency could have anticipated the delay and how long the agency was aware of the reasons for the delay before it informed the administrative judge and the appellant. Here, the appellant filed her petition for appeal on May 23, 1996. Both parties engaged in <span id="Page_1111"></span>the prehearing processing of the appeal on its merits. It was not until September 6, 1996--over three months later and less than one week before the scheduled hearing--that the agency moved to dismiss or postpone the appeal on the basis of "judicial economy." The state licensing requirement was presumably in existence when the appellant filed her petition for appeal. The agency, however, has not explained why it could not have anticipated a possible delay because of a state proceeding or at least have informed the administrative judge and the appellant of a possible delay. <span class="Italic">See Thomas</span>, 51 MSPR at 221.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has directed the Board to process appeals expeditiously, and the Board has maintained a policy of holding hearings promptly unless extraordinary circumstances have been shown. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 51 MSPR at 220. This policy was implemented because delays adversely affect employees who might be unemployed while their appeals are pending, or who, at the least, are subject to great uncertainty about the future course of their careers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The hearing is the employee's only opportunity to probe anew the factual portion of the employee's case before an impartial tribunal. Thus, the right to a hearing will not be lightly disregarded. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Consistent with this policy, the Board has stated that a case may not go on indefinitely given the Congressional mandate that cases be adjudicated expeditiously. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 69 MSPR at 44.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The DWOP may be entered on the AJ's volition in actions other than an initial appeal. <span class="Italic">Ben Espinoza v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 679, 682 (1996), determined the procedure to be unobjectionable in an enforcement proceeding brought to remedy a breach of a settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge erred in dismissing his petition for enforcement without prejudice. The Board, however, has previously found that <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> dismissals for short periods of time are appropriate to avoid lengthy postponements, and are in accordance with the Board's policy of processing cases in an expeditious manner while still ensuring appropriate consideration of unforeseeable circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Neubeiser v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 47 MSPR 125, 127 (1991). The Board reviews such dismissals under an abuse of discretion standard. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 43 MSPR 204, 208 (1990) (no error in administrative judge's dismissal of appeal without prejudice for 45 days to facilitate discovery). Accordingly, we find no error by the administrative judge in dismissing the appeal without prejudice.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 81 MSPR 62, 64-65 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (AJ-initiated DWOP was properly used in an enforcement proceeding to permit the parties to consult on, and attempt to resolve, outstanding issues without the assistance of an AJ).

<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined at the level of a PFR to dismiss removal appeals without prejudice to refile while OSC completed investigations into issues intertwined with the removals (proposals to remove). The Board reasoned that if OSC concluded that the appellants were entitled to corrective action, administrative resolution could be promoted by allowing OSC to complete its investigation before the Board adjudicated the appeals. The Board declined to credit agency arguments that the delay could be prejudicial because of difficulty obtaining testimony from witnesses. The agency did not explain why particular, material witnesses could not testify at a later time or why their depositions or affidavits could not be obtained in anticipation of refiling of the appeals. The appeals were dismissed with leave to refile not later than 65 days after issuance of OSC's written notice to appellants that OSC terminated its investigation of their joint complaint. <span class="Italic">Krape v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 126, 131 &#x00B6; 14 (2000). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-060.html#sec5-60">Dismissal Without Prejudice</a>," for discussion concerning petitions for review.]</p>
