<p class="Body-Text">When an agency automated system failed to provide the appellant the proper veterans preference during the application process, the Board required the agency to reconstruct the competitive process and to follow the passover process if the appellant, who would have ranked highest on the list of best qualified applicants, was not selected. <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, 117 MSPR 341, 344-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-17, 2012 MSPB 13 (2012) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, 120 MSPR 42, 2013 MSPB 57 (2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>; following second remand, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, DC-3330-11-0405-B-1 (NP 4/1/2014, <span class="Italic">post</span>), remanded for consideration of additional evidence, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, 591 Fed. Appx. 937 (2014), following further remand, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS,</span> DC-3330-11-0405-M-1 (NP 5/8/2015)), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA gives the Board jurisdiction to decide whether the agency violated the appellant's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), (d). There is no dispute here that the agency failed to give the appellant the full veterans' preference to which he was entitled by statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309(1). As the administrative judge correctly recognized, the only question is whether the appellant, rather than the agency, should be held responsible for this violation. We conclude that the administrative judge erred in assigning the responsibility to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An applicant who seeks a veterans' preference must provide the agency with sufficient proof of his entitlement to the preference. <span class="Italic">See Graves v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 27 n.3 (2010); <span class="Italic">Badana v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 14 (2006). But the agency may not deprive the applicant of his rights merely because he makes a minor technical mistake in submitting his application, at least when the agency has enough information to afford him his rights anyway. In <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9-10 (2008), for example, we held that the agency violated a preference eligible applicant's right to compete by refusing to consider him for a GS-7 position when his resume indicated his interest in that position, even though the application form itself stated that he was interested only in a GS-8 position. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318, 1324-25 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the court held that the agency violated a preference eligible applicant's right to credit for all relevant experience when it ignored experience listed in military documents that was not repeated on a two-page application form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the agency deprived the appellant of his full 10-point preference because of what is at most a minor technical mistake, even though the information the agency had should have alerted it that he might be eligible for the preference. The appellant took all the steps he reasonably believed were needed to establish his entitlement to a 10-point preference. As discussed above, it is undisputed that he followed the agency's instructions by faxing it the VA letter with the special QuickHire-generated coversheet. He received electronic confirmation that the agency had received this fax. Even assuming that the appellant erred by reusing the coversheet, he was never warned--and had no reason to suspect--that doing so would erase his earlier fax, and the QuickHire system did not allow him to check whether the agency in fact had the VA letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency knew, or at least should have known, that the appellant might be entitled to a 10-point preference. Even though it was missing the VA letter, the agency's file contained the appellant's application for a 10-point preference as well has his SF 50-B stating that he was entitled to that preference. Because the appellant used a QuickHire-generated fax coversheet with a barcode for a VA letter, the system should have reflected that he had at least tried to submit this document. The agency could have tentatively granted the appellant a 10-point preference and sought documentation in the event the preference mattered to the selection process, or it could have followed up with him immediately to determine if he had submitted the VA letter. Yet the agency made no effort to notify the appellant that is was missing the key document or to determine from the rest of the file whether he was entitled to a 10-point preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In these circumstances, we conclude that the agency, not the appellant, should be held responsible for the failure to give him a full 10-point preference. Because the agency therefore violated the appellant's right to a 10-point preference in competing for the vacancy at issue, the agency must reconstruct the selection process after adding 5 more points to the appellant's score. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 18 (2006). The agency will have to go through the pass-over procedures--including giving the appellant notice and an opportunity to respond to the Office of Personnel Management--before selecting a lower-ranked non-preference-eligible applicant through the reconstructed process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Endres v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 10 (2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We emphasize that we are not deciding here that an agency must follow up with every applicant who claims a preference but has not submitted the necessary documentation. The appellant was deprived of his preference here because of a flaw in the agency's QuickHire system that the agency apparently knew existed but did not warn applicants about. We note that the agency has replaced the QuickHire system with one that does not erase faxed supporting materials, so we expect that this problem will not recur. We reserve for a later case the question of whether an agency must follow up in other circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find a violation of the appellant's right to a veterans' preference based on the record developed at the hearing, we need not address any of the other arguments the appellant raised in his petition for review. In particular, we have not relied on any of the new evidence that the appellant attached to his petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We ORDER the agency to reconstruct the hiring process for vacancy announcement HHS-FDA-04-2011-0005, giving the appellant a full 10-point veterans' preference. The agency must complete this action no later than 30 days after the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the Board's <span class="Italic">Russell</span> 2012 decision, the agency reconstructed the action but determined that the appellant was unqualified for the position; the result was that 10-point veterans preference was not applied. The case returned to the Board and then was sent back to the AJ to obtain further information from the agency as to disqualification of the appellant, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, 120 MSPR 42, 45, 47-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 8-14, 2013 MSPB 57 (2013) (Member Robbins dissenting) (remanded for consideration of additional evidence, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, 591 Fed. Appx. 937 (2014), following remand, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS,</span> DC-3330-11-0405-M-1 (NP 5/8/2015)), the Board noting that as part of the reconstruction process the agency is to take the original selectee out of the position, conduct and evaluate interviews so that they are meaningfully comparable to the original selectee's interview, and fill the same number of vacancies as before:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Board's order, the agency reconstructed the selection process. As part of the reconstructed process, a Human Resources (HR) Specialist and a Subject Matter Expert independently evaluated the appellant's application and concluded that the appellant failed to meet the applicable OPM qualification standards and specialized experience requirements. Because the agency found that the appellant was not minimally qualified for the position, it did not assign him a numerical score and therefore did not award him the 10-point preference. The agency explained that the appellant's assigned score from the original selection process was only a preliminary score generated by the QuickHire system based upon the appellant's assessment of his experience and was not based on the review of his application by the HR Specialist or the Subject Matter Expert.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to consider an appellant's claim of agency noncompliance with a Board order. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Board's authority to remedy noncompliance is broad and far-reaching and functions to ensure that employees or applicants for employment are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> or the position that they would have been in had the unlawful <span id="Page_656"></span>agency action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6; 7 (2010). The agency has the burden of proving that it has fully complied with a Board final decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency is required to produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of compliance in the form of documentation or affidavits. <span class="Italic">Spates v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 438, 443 (1996). In order to comply with the Board's Opinion and Order, therefore, the agency must produce evidence showing that its reconstruction of the selection process for vacancy announcement HHS-FDA-04-2011-0005 was in accordance with applicable veterans' preference laws and that any subsequent appointment to the Social Science Analyst (Organizational Development) position was the result of fair and lawful consideration of the pool of candidates, including the appellant, under an appropriate and lawful reconstruction. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we agree with the administrative judge's determination that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's argument that the position at issue should have been classified in the 0301 series rather than the 0101 series. Compliance Initial Decision at 4-5 (citing <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over cases concerning the proper classification of a position)). We also agree with the administrative judge's findings that the Board did not mandate assigning the appellant any particular score on review of his application and that the Board does not have the authority to order the agency to appoint the appellant to a position for which he is not qualified. <span class="Italic">See Russell</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 17; <span class="Italic">Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). However, we find that a conflict exists in the record with respect to whether the appellant indeed was qualified for the Social Science Analyst (Organizational Development) position at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to meet the OPM qualification standards for this position, a candidate must possess a degree in behavioral or social science or related disciplines appropriate to the position, or a combination of education and experience that provided knowledge of one or more of the behavioral or social sciences equivalent to a major in the field, or 4 years of appropriate experience that demonstrated acquisition of knowledge of one or more of the behavioral or social sciences equivalent to a major in the field. In addition to meeting the OPM qualification standards for the position, candidates must possess or demonstrate 1 year of related specialized experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its January 20, 2011 letter to DOL responding to the appellant's complaint, the agency stated that, according to the appellant's unofficial transcript, he met the positive education requirements for the position because he had completed nine behavioral or social science-related courses totaling 27 credit hours. The agency further indicated that the appellant met the 1 year of specialized experience that was equivalent to the GS-11 grade level and was in or directly related to the position to be filled. These determinations were made by Marcia Gosha-Caldwell, who did not provide a title when signing the January 20, 2011 letter, but, as of an agency filing dated April 9, 2012, was a Supervisory HR Specialist at the agency. Therefore, as of January 2011, it appears that the agency had found the appellant qualified for the Social Science Analyst (Organizational Development) position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reconstructing the selection process in February 2012, however, the agency, through Nakia Kamara, an HR Specialist, and Jackie Salter, a Subject Matter Expert, determined that the appellant did not meet the OPM qualification standards and specialized experience requirements for the position. Specifically, the agency determined that the appellant's application package showed that he had degrees in business administration and management and possessed general administrative experience, but did not show that he met the OPM qualification standards for the position or that he had performed duties and responsibilities in prior positions at the scope and level of complexity required for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to properly reconstruct a selection, an agency must conduct an actual selection process based on the same circumstances surrounding the original faulty selection. <span class="Italic">Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 14 (2013). This includes taking the original selectee out of the position, conducting and evaluating interviews so that they are meaningfully comparable with the original selectee's interview, and filling the same number of vacancies as before. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Phillips</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 19, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19. Based on the record before us, we are unable to determine whether the agency removed the original selectee from the position, whether the agency employed the same criteria for selection during the reconstructed selection process that it employed during the original selection process, or whether the agency changed the selection process when it reconstructed the original selection. Indeed, although the agency claims that the appellant's score of 94.69 during the original selection process was only a "preliminary" score based upon his "self-assessment," the record shows that the three top-ranked applicants from the original selection process were forwarded to the selecting official based upon those same, so-called "preliminary" scores. Further, while we recognize that VEOA does not enable veterans to be considered for positions for which they are not qualified, <span class="Italic">see Ramsey</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9, the agency has not set forth any explanation for its apparent change in its assessment of the appellant's qualifications since its January 20, 2011 letter to DOL, or how this apparent change is consistent with an appropriate and lawful reconstruction of the selection process. Therefore, we are unable to find the agency in compliance with our Opinion and Order. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 15 (2009) (finding the agency not in compliance with the Board's order to reconstruct the selection process when the agency previously stipulated that it would have selected the appellant in the absence of the veterans' preference violation, but it failed to select him in the reconstructed selection process without adequate explanation for the inconsistency). Accordingly, we remand the appeal for further development of the record. <span class="Italic">See Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 603, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 5-6 (2008) (the Board remanded the appeal to supplement shortcomings in the factual record that were material to a determination of whether the agency was in compliance with the Board's final order to reconstruct the selection process for the positions at issue in accordance with veterans' preference laws); <span class="Italic">Spates</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 442 (the Board remanded the appeal because the record was insufficiently developed to allow a determination as to whether the agency was in compliance with the Board's final order to return the appellant as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> after mitigation of the penalty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the agency is required to produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of compliance in the form of documentation or affidavits. <span class="Italic">Spates</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 443. The administrative judge shall then issue a new compliance initial decision based on the evidence submitted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Should the administrative judge find the agency's explanation for its apparent change in its assessment of the appellant's qualifications not credible, then the administrative judge shall find the agency in noncompliance with the Board's Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again reviewed the appeal in <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, DC-3330-11-0405-B-1 (NP 4/1/2014) (remanded for consideration of additional evidence, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS</span>, 591 Fed. Appx. 937 (2014), following remand, reaffirming earlier determination, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DHHS,</span> DC-3330-11-0405-M-1 (NP 5/8/2015)), concluding that the reconstruction process was adequate despite the appellant's failure to secure selection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has demonstrated that it conducted the reconstructed selection process based on the same circumstances surrounding the original selection. The evidence demonstrates that the original selectee was no longer in the position at the time of the reconstruction process, and, therefore, reconstruction did not require her removal from the position. Further, the same human resource specialist and same subject matter expert conducted the same review process in both selections. Specifically, under both selections, the agency generated a ranked applicant pool list based upon the applicants' self-assessed scores of their qualifications, including veterans' preference points. The human resource specialist then reviewed each applicant's qualifications, starting with the top-ranked applicant on the list, until she found three minimally-qualified applicants for each grade at which the position was announced. Her review of the appellant's application materials for minimum qualification during the reconstructed process did not constitute a new circumstance of the selection process, but was merely the result of the appellant's higher ranking on the reconstructed applicant pool list after being properly awarded his 10-point preference towards his preliminary self-assessment score. The appellant's application materials were subjected to the same review as the other top-ranked applicants' materials, including those deemed to be best qualified. The record evidence further demonstrates that no interviews were conducted under either selection process, and only one selection was made during each process. To the extent that the appellant alleges that the original selectee remained in the position during reconstruction and that interviews were conducted during the original process, he has failed to provide or identify record evidence supporting those contentions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge that the agency has adequately explained its changed assessment during reconstruction of the appellant's qualifications. According to the agency, the reconstruction assessment was reviewed and memorialized in a memorandum by a more seasoned human resource practitioner than the practitioner who completed the January 2011 letter to DOL, which stated that the appellant was qualified for the position. Further, the reconstruction memorandum included a comprehensive analysis that factored all of the OPM requirements relative to the basic education and specialized experience requirements. By contrast, the January 2011 letter contained significant errors with respect to the appellant's educational credits, including improperly crediting the appellant with 27 semester hours for coursework that did not fall within the behavioral or social science fields of studies. The January 2011 letter also failed to articulate how the appellant's work experience satisfied the basic education or specialized <span id="Page_657"></span>experience requirements. In light of the January 2011 letter's deficiencies and the agency's reasonable determination during reconstruction that the appellant was not qualified, the administrative judge properly found that the agency sufficiently explained its changed assessment of the appellant's qualifications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to follow the passover process with alleged detrimental effect to the appellant constitutes a VEOA claim, <span class="Italic">Alegre v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 118 MSPR 424, 429 &#x00B6; 13, 2012 MSPB 96 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated her rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. Specifically, she asserted that the agency violated the pass over requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 by not selecting her for one of the positions. This provision qualifies as a statute relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Garcia</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 8 n.2.</p>
