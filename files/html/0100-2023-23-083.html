<p class="Body-Text">A back pay award must include the differential and premium pay that the appellants would have received had they been properly reinstated to their former positions. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 MSPR 593, 596-97 (1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 399, 403 (1987) (agency demonstrated that appellant would have been assigned to a location not creating a right to premium pay); <span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 74 MSPR 289, 293 (1997) (treatment of relocation expenses). The premium pay entitlement may be based upon treatment of employees similarly situated to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Owens v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 99 MSPR 377 (2005) (following <span class="Italic">Mattern:</span> the Back Pay Act required the payment of premium pay as a back pay remedy despite contrary language in an appropriations statute); <span class="Italic">House v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HOUSE_BOBBY_L_DA_0752_02_0385_X_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246512.pdf">98 MSPR 530</a>, 535-36 &#x00B6; 13 (2005). Premiums may include differentials, e.g., living quarters allowance for employees whose employment is terminated in an area that would support the payment of the allowance. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Army</span>, 90 MSPR 136, 146 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24 (2001) (living quarters allowance); <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 288, 290-91 (1986) (LQA and other allowances: following an advisory opinion from the Comptroller General). For discussion of the concept of "basic pay" relative to a retirement claim, refer to <span class="Italic">Lisanti v. OPM</span>, 573 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2009). [Refer earlier to "<a href="0100-2023-23-082.html#sec16-81">Bonus or Award; Differential; Relocation Expense</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of whether various payments in addition to salary are components of or collateral to back pay entitlement is not easily resolved. Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-068.html#sec16-68">Collateral Result of Restoration Order; Action Related to Case Under Appeal,</a>" and the tangled history of <span class="Italic">Mattern v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 291 F.3d 1366, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to overtime, <span class="Italic">O'Reilly v. FAA</span>, 29 MSPR 405, 409 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), appellant is entitled to "an amount equal to all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred...." He is also entitled to any overtime he would have earned during the period of erroneous removal, even though the overtime was not actually scheduled. FPM Supplement, Book 500, S-8b(4) (April 20, 1984).

Department of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 86, 90 (1988). The Board has approved the use of averaging the hours worked by similarly situated employees in cases where using the appellant's pre-removal work history may not have reflected the period during the wrongful separation. For instance, the Board approved this method in a case where an employee was demoted to a position in which he had not been previously employed, and, therefore, had no overtime employment history. <span class="Italic">Bonacchi v. United States Postal Service</span>, 46 MSPR 531 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 651 (1987), the Board held that it would be improper to base an overtime award on post-reinstatement overtime history and found that averaging the number of hours worked by similarly situated employees would be appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the Board specifically noted that "[u]se of the appellant's pre-removal overtime work history could have been appropriate here" but found that it was not because the appellant was suffering medical problems during that period resulting from job-related stress. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 656. The Board also approved the use of this method when the appellant had limited availability because he was enrolled in school and, consequently, did not work substantial overtime prior to his removal. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 50 MSPR 686 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, comparison to similarly situated employees during the period of wrongful separation would not most nearly place the appellant in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. The appellant had a clear work history which demonstrated that he worked a substantial amount of overtime during a lengthy period immediately preceding his removal. His service card indicates that he averaged 13.675 hours per pay period based on a review of 20 pay periods. This evidence establishes that the appellant had a long history of working a sizable amount of overtime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the agency's evidence of compliance, it asserted that averaging the overtime hours of similarly situated employees was the appropriate method "[d]ue to the distinct evolutions in ship overhaul inherent in the work performed at the shipyard...." This statement alone is insufficient to justify ignoring the appellant's pre-suspension overtime work history and adopting the alternative method of averaging the hours of similarly situated employees. We note that, out of a list of hours of 57 similarly situated employees, 13 worked more than 200 hours of overtime during the relevant period, 6 worked more than the 281 hours the appellant asserts that he is due, and 3 worked between 481 and 581 hours of overtime. Consequently, it is clear that, in spite of "evolutions in ship overhaul," as alleged by the agency, the agency has maintained a need for other WG-08 Insulators, like the appellant, to work substantial amounts of overtime. Where there is no evidence that conditions during the wrongful separation varied from conditions prior to the removal, basing an overtime award on pre-separation work history is an appropriate means of calculation to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In Re Clark</span>, 62 Comp. Gen. 370, 374 (1983). The facts and circumstances of this case weigh strongly in favor of computing the appellant's overtime hours based on his pre-separation work history as the appropriate method for calculating his overtime back pay.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency calculated the appellant's overtime back pay by averaging the overtime worked by employees in the same directorate, who held the same position at the same grade level as the appellant, for every pay period from 2010 through October 2012. The appellant argues that he worked considerably more overtime than these similarly situated employees. To support his argument, the appellant provided a summary of the overtime he worked each pay period for the 3 years and 8 months immediately preceding his placement on administrative leave prior to his first indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Brady</span>, the appellant's work history demonstrates that he worked substantial amounts of overtime in the period immediately preceding his indefinite suspensions, and worked significantly more overtime than similarly situated employees. Comparing the evidence of the appellant's overtime history with that of the overtime worked for similarly situated employees, the appellant's overtime history is the method more likely to place him in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that overtime varies from month-to-month and year-to-year depending on budget and workload. Such a statement, without supporting evidence, is insufficient to justify ignoring the appellant's overtime work history. <span class="Italic">See Brady</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 697. The agency has not presented any evidence that the conditions during the periods of time that the appellant was indefinitely suspended varied in some way that would justify ignoring his overtime history in calculating his overtime back pay. Thus, the method the agency used to calculate the appellant's overtime back pay was not the one most likely to return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, and the agency must recalculate it based on the appellant's overtime history.</p>

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 660, the agency reviewed only the ten pay periods immediately preceding the appellant's suspension and removal and determined that no overtime should be awarded for the one-and-a-half-year back pay period because the appellant had worked no overtime during the ten pay periods under review. The Board found the agency's overtime determination correct where the appellant did not claim that he regularly worked overtime that was made available to him or that the ten pay periods inaccurately reflected <span id="Page_4876"></span>his preremoval overtime history. Here, in contrast, the appellant has argued that he worked substantially more hours of overtime than the agency's estimate. In the absence of evidence supporting the agency's claim that the appellant worked an average of 6.25 hours of overtime and the appellant's assertion that he worked between 12 and 20 hours per week, we cannot determine whether the agency has calculated the proper amount of overtime back pay. Therefore, to meet its burden of proof on compliance, the agency must submit evidence of the overtime worked by the appellant during pay periods 13 through 19, explain why it was appropriate to use this period of overtime history, and address the appellant's claim that his average overtime exceeded the approximately six hours cited by the agency.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency followed a decision of the Comptroller General that back overtime pay may be based either upon an employee's prior overtime experience or, as applied in Mr. Naekel's case, upon the overtime experience of similarly situated employees who were not removed during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">In re Ranieri</span>, B-207997.2 (Comp.

However, we agree with the government that it is inappropriate to apply an average figure when a more precise calculation is easily made.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency must be prepared to demonstrate that the appellant is not being penalized for the same reasons that led to the unsuccessful adverse action. If the employee had lower overtime earnings because of the employee's alcoholism and the alcoholism led to removal, once the removal is reversed as discriminatory, the agency may not perpetuate the discrimination by calculating overtime on the assumption that it could have permitted the employee to continue in his job without rehabilitation. If the agency overtime calculation would be discriminatory on the basis of the appellant's past experience, the overtime will be calculated on the basis of the average overtime worked by members of the appellant's work unit. <span class="Italic">Swafford v.

<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Swafford</span> formulation was followed and applied in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 651, 656 (1987), concluding that an agency should not calculate past overtime entitlement on the basis of post-reinstatement hours, there being too much opportunity for manipulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Use of the appellant's pre-removal overtime work history could have been appropriate here, especially in light of the appellant's supervisor's affidavit that the calculation of the percentage of overtime worked was based only on the overtime available when the appellant was ready and able to work, but which he declined to work.... However, evidence of record in this case indicates that the appellant suffered from an acute anxiety neurosis brought on by job-related stress. Under such circumstances, it would not be expected that the appellant would work the number of hours overtime he would normally have worked if the job site were not a source of serious stress to him. Thus, since the appellant's pre-removal overtime history would not be truly reflective of what the appellant may have worked in a different environment, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency should determine the appellant's overtime back pay in this case by averaging the number of overtime hours worked by his fellow employees occupying similar positions during the removal period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anderson</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Davis v.

See Anderson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR at 655; <span class="Italic">O'Reilly v. Department of Transportation</span>, 29 MSPR at 409. In this case, the administrative judge based the calculation of overtime on the overtime assignments of similarly situated employees rather than the appellant's prior overtime assignments. During the year before his removal, the appellant indicated that he was often unavailable for overtime work because he was taking classes to become a Food Technologist. However, Mr. Harris indicated that because he had nearly completed these courses prior to his wrongful removal, his prior overtime history would not have truly reflected the amount of overtime he would have worked during the period of his wrongful termination. Therefore, we conclude that the administrative judge properly found that the experience of similarly situated employees during the relevant periods was the proper basis on which to calculate the appellant's overtime claims<span class="Italic">. See Anderson</span>, 33 MSPR at 656 (an employee's preremoval overtime work history would be appropriate in calculating the overtime to which he would have been entitled if it is truly reflective of the amount of overtime he could have worked during the relevant time periods).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the Board determined that overtime back pay should be calculated by averaging the number of overtime hours worked by fellow employees occupying similar positions during the removal period and rejected the argument that overtime should be based on all the overtime hours that were available to the appellant in that case. 33 MSPR at 656. Similarly, because the appellant's rotational assignment during the period of his removal would have placed him at Paramount Foods, we reject the appellant's argument that the agency must calculate and average the overtime of all 7 food inspectors in the Louisville, Kentucky area. Moreover, the Board finds that it was proper for the administrative judge to base overtime calculations on similarly situated food inspectors at Paramount.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant asserts in his exceptions to the Recommendation that the administrative judge and the agency failed to take into account that, under the union's bargaining unit contract providing for the equalization of overtime, these similarly situated employees at Paramount were permitted to work overtime on weekends and holidays at other plant facilities. Although the agency asserted that the appellant's overtime was calculated based on the overtime of other Paramount employees in similar positions, the agency did not submit any evidence showing what these similarly situated employees made at other plants, or what they made on weekends and holidays. Thus, the Board finds it necessary for the agency to provide evidence of the overtime worked by other similarly situated employees at Paramount during the period of time of the appellant's wrongful removal. Therefore, the total average overtime, including overtime at other plants and for holidays and weekends, of other Paramount Food food inspectors is the appropriate measure of the overtime appellant would have worked during the period of his removal<span class="Italic">. See Anderson</span>, 33 MSPR at 656. The Board thus finds that until the agency submits evidence detailing the amount of overtime other similarly situated employees worked at Paramount and at other <span id="Page_4877"></span>plants during this period, including weekends and holidays, the agency is in noncompliance with the Board's order awarding back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that under <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Department of the Navy</span>, the appellant is entitled to overtime back pay for the time period of his "close supervision" assignment because that assignment arose from the same allegations that led to his removal. However, the agency's calculations of overtime for this period do not conform to the requirements set out in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Air Force</span>. While the day shift food inspectors at Fischer Packing were the employees most similarly situated to the appellant in terms of calculating overtime, we cannot agree that the appellant is entitled to only half the overtime earned by the other food inspectors, since the other food inspectors received the full amount of overtime. Under <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the correct manner to determine overtime would be to average the number of overtime hours worked by fellow employees occupying similar positions. Therefore, we find that the agency must present evidence showing the average amount of overtime of the similarly situated employees (Sherrard, Cosby and Helm) during this period. The Board finds that the overtime pay that the appellant was able to earn during this period should be deducted from that averaged amount of overtime to arrive at the amount of additional overtime pay due the appellant for this period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Commenting on both the method of sampling for overtime calculation and the method of calculation when a removal is mitigated to a demotion, <span class="Italic">Bonacchi v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 531, 535-36 (1991), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency should search its microfiche records of all 2,800 employees so that it can be certain that every employee who worked at pay location 161 has been identified and that the overtime calculation should be based on the number of employees found. The appellant has not, however, shown that 14 is not an accurate count of employees who worked at the pay location for the entire period or that the overtime worked by these employees is not representative of the average overtime worked by employees in that position. The appellant has not claimed that the 14 employees are not representative of the group. In light of the foregoing, the administrative judge properly did not order the agency to mount such a search.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 807 F.2d 169 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's decision that the calculation of overtime payments by adding up the number of hours worked by similarly situated employees and dividing that sum by the total number of similarly situated employees was an appropriate way to determine the overtime which an employee would have worked during the period of a canceled adverse action. Accordingly, the agency in this case properly used the average hours of overtime worked by similarly situated employees as a means to calculate the overtime that the appellant would have worked had he not been removed and been demoted to the position of distribution clerk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative to using average overtime hours worked by employees in pay location 161, the appellant contends that the calculation of the overtime to which he is entitled should be based on the overtime that he received as a supervisor before he was demoted. The administrative judge in the November 21, 1989 Recommendation correctly decided that overtime pay should be awarded based on the pay rate of a distribution clerk. When an employee has been removed from a supervisory position and the penalty is mitigated to a demotion to the position of distribution clerk, the back pay award should be based on the position to which the employee was demoted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Glover v. United States Postal Service</span>, 23 MSPR 306, 308 (1984). Accordingly, because the agency should have demoted the appellant and not removed him, the agency correctly used the position to which the appellant was demoted in calculating the overtime to which the appellant was entitled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant's removal is mitigated by the Board to a demotion, the "same employment status" refers to the overtime experience of other personnel holding the job assigned to the appellant by demotion. The appellant's overtime experience in his former but different position is irrelevant to the overtime determination based on the position obtained by demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDonough v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 122, 129 (1993); <span class="Italic">Bonacchi</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Carter v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 377, 380 (1987), the agency should calculate overtime based on the appellant's retroactive restoration to the full-time regular position that he would have been able to perform up to the date he was actually restored to full-time regular duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There may be other factors that must be taken into account in the overtime equation, including the nature of rotational assignments and overtime equalization requirements of collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 50 MSPR 686, 696 (1991). If collective bargaining contracts govern the calculations or assignment of overtime, then overtime should be calculated in accordance with the agreement in effect during various portions of the period of unlawful removal. <span class="Italic">Gay v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 476, 483-84 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Overtime calculations may be influenced by agency pay practices. In <span class="Italic">Boomer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 541, 546 (1992), an analysis of overtime for employees in positions comparable to the position that the appellant should have held showed that overtime was rarely assigned and amounted to an average of four minutes per employee. The agency argued, and the Board agreed, that because it did not pay overtime for periods less than one-tenth of an hour, the overtime due to the appellant was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, insufficient to entitle him to an award of overtime pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Entitlement to holiday pay is computed using the same principles applied to overtime back pay. <span class="Italic">Russo v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 296, 302-03 &#x00B6; 15, 2007 MSPB 277 (2007); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Suggs v.

Where the agency computes the appellant's entitlement to overtime and holiday back pay based upon his work history, the agency should consider the actual days that the appellant worked overtime and holidays prior to his removal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 10."); <span class="Italic">Blanchard v.

<p class="Body-Text">If while the agency is investigating or finalizing disciplinary action, the employee is removed from his position and placed on administrative leave, he has no right to overtime during the time he was taken out of the position, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, DA-0752-11-0147-C-1 (NP 9/12/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that he is entitled to overtime pay because his placement on administrative leave was related to the now-reversed removal. The appellant argues that the administrative judge misapplied <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 245 F. App'x 961 (Fed. Cir. 2007), to the facts of this case to determine that he was not entitled to overtime pay as part of his back pay award. The appellant argues that Board law has held that a back pay award generally includes overtime pay that the appellant would have earned had the wrongful personnel action not occurred, and, in his case, while he was placed on administrative leave prior to the removal, his position of record was still Senior Border Patrol Agent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge thoroughly discussed <span class="Italic">Moore</span> and found that the <span class="Italic">Moore</span> decisions stand for the proposition that, when an agency removes an employee from his position while investigating or finalizing disciplinary action, and the employee is no longer in a position that is eligible for, or that provides, overtime pay immediately before the agency takes the disciplinary action, the Board will not subsequently order the agency to pay overtime as part of the back pay. We agree with the administrative judge that <span class="Italic">Moore</span> is directly on point.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, the appellant was taken out of his Police Officer position in September 2004, and placed on administrative duties until his removal on February 5, 2005. The Board found that, because the appellant's pay status immediately prior to the agency's action did not include overtime or premium pay, he had not made the necessary nonfrivolous allegation that he was entitled to either type of pay during the removal period. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 11 (2006). While the court reversed the Board's determinations that other back pay calculations were correct based solely on Mr. Moore's admission that he had received his back pay, the court agreed with the Board that Mr. Moore was "not entitled to overtime or premium pay for the relevant period (between February 5, 2005 and April 1, 2005) since he was not entitled to such pay in the position that he occupied before his removal." <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, 245 F. App'x at 963-64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that <span class="Italic">Moore</span> is distinguishable from his case because he was placed on "administrative leave" rather than on "administrative duties." We disagree. The agency's actions in both cases removed the appellants from their regular duties while an investigation was ongoing, and the agency's actions were not initially appealable to the Board. Further, based on an affidavit by a Human Resource Specialist with the Office of Human Resources, Customs and Border Protection, we agree with the administrative judge that the distinction between placement on administrative leave or administrative duties is not significant. Specifically, the affidavit states that "[w]hether an employee is placed on administrative leave or administrative duty is discretionary with the designated management official." The affidavit described administrative leave as being in a paid status without reporting for work but the employee can be called in at any time. Whereas, administrative duty is where the employee's weapon is removed and the employee is assigned administrative functions, i.e. "desk duty." Thus, because an employee who has been placed in either an administrative leave status or assigned to administrative duties is being paid even though the employee is not performing the duties in his official position of record, we see no significant distinction between this case and <span class="Italic">Moore</span>. Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to disturb the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Noted in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> was <span class="Italic">Moore v. VA</span>, 102 MSPR 689, 693 &#x00B6; 11, 2006 MSPB 248 (2006) (aff'd in part, <span class="Italic">Moore v. VA</span>, 245 Fed. Appx. 961 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), stating <span id="Page_4878"></span>as to a claim for overtime arising in an appeal challenging the sufficiency of an agency's cancelation of an adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that his appeal is not moot because the agency did not pay him overtime and premium pay. However, in his affidavit, the appellant states that, for five months prior to the effective date of the removal at issue in this appeal, he had been on "desk duty," and had not been assigned all of his regular duties or regular shifts as a Police Officer. He states that, beginning on September 2, 2004, he began "working an administrative tour of duty...Monday thru Friday 8 am to 4:30 pm with weekends and holidays off." We find that the appellant's pay status immediately prior to the agency's effecting his removal on February 5, 2005 did not include any overtime or premium pay. Thus, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was entitled to overtime and premium pay from February 5, 2005 to the date of his voluntary demotion, the period of time at issue here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moore v. VA</span>, 245 Fed. Appx. 961, 963-64 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), affirmed on the point:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the Board that Moore is not entitled to overtime or premium pay for the relevant period (between February 5, 2005 and April 1, 2005) since he was not entitled to such pay in the position that he occupied before his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Upon reinstatement through a Board order, back pay entitlement "generally includes overtime and premium pay that the appellant would have earned had the wrongful personnel action not occurred," <span class="Italic">Owens v.

VA</span>, DE-0752-12-0006-C-1 (NP 8/29/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency improperly calculated her premium back pay for Sundays and holidays by using an "arbitrary methodology" that failed to return her to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, and that the administrative judge erred by affirming the agency's calculations. Specifically, she argues that the initial decision is contrary to law because: (1) it relies on case law pertaining to overtime back pay, which should not be applied to premium back pay; and (2) it upholds a methodology that fails to compensate her in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(a)(1), which requires that the employee "shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency during the period covered by the corrective action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board orders an agency action cancelled, the ultimate goal is to place, as nearly as possible, the appellant in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>; that is, the situation in which she would have been had the wrongful personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Owens v. Department of Transportation</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). This obligation requires paying her all the back pay to which she is entitled under the Back Pay Act, including the pay, annual and holiday leave, allowances, or differentials plus interest she normally would have earned or received but for the wrongful personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Vidal v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 395, &#x00B6; 10 (1999). It also generally includes the premium pay she would have received but for the action. <span class="Italic">Owens</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the record shows that the agency determined the premium pay due to the appellant by calculating the percentage of Sundays and holidays she worked for a 21/2-year period prior to the removal notice and then using that percentage to extrapolate the premium pay she would have earned but for the removal. The administrative judge found this method was reasonable or workable, and consistent with Board precedent. <span class="Italic">See House v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 9 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to her argument, it is well settled that an appellant's entitlement to premium back pay is computed using the same principles applied to overtime back pay. <span class="Italic">See House</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Blanchard v. Department of Justice</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 513, 515-16 (1989). Both overtime and premium back pay may be calculated, as the agency did here, by using the average premium hours worked by the employee prior to the removal to extrapolate the premium hours she would have worked but for the removal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The Board will not nullify the method employed by the agency in calculating a back pay award absent a showing that the method was unreasonable or unworkable. <span class="Italic">Ball v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 10, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 53 F. App'x 910 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Vidal</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 395, &#x00B6; 12. We discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the agency applied a reasonable or workable method to determine the appellant's premium back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant argues that the agency's methodology for calculating her premium back pay violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(a)(1) because it fails to compensate her as if she "performed service for the agency during the period covered by the corrective action." In determining the appropriate amount of premium back pay, however, the agency is not required to reconstruct the actual times the appellant would have worked. <span class="Italic">See Welber v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 244, 246 n.2 (1996). The agency may use either of the methods discussed above for computing the premium pay that the appellant likely would have earned but for the wrongful personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case, the agency used an acceptable method when it calculated the appellant's premium back pay based on her history of working premium assignments for the 21/2-year period before the removal. We discern no reason to find that this time period was unreasonable or unworkable. <span class="Italic">See Ball</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Vidal</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 395, &#x00B6; 12. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency's calculation of premium back pay was reasonable or workable, and that the agency paid the appellant an appropriate amount of back pay.</p>
