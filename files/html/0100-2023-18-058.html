<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-59"><span class="space">d.</span> Independent Elements of Single Charge</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Analysis may depend on whether the agency charged one act with several elements or two or more acts. The Federal Circuit distinguished the impermissible splitting of an inseparable charge describing a single act of misconduct and permissible analysis of distinguishable acts contained in a single charge, <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 564-65 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy charged Chauvin with "unauthorized possession and attempted removal of Government property."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chauvin argues that the board majority erred in considering there to be a single charge against him. He asserts that his demotion was effectively based upon two distinct charges: (1) unauthorized possession of the metal plate, and (2) attempted removal of the plate from the shipyard. We agree. When a single stated charge contains two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent upon each other and that do not comprise a single, inseparable event, each act constitutes a separate charge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Coyle v. Department of Treasury</span>, 62 MSPR 241, 245 (1994). The charges cited in the deciding official's letter, "unauthorized possession and attempted removal of Government property," describe two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent upon each other and that do not comprise a single, inseparable event. One can improperly possess an item without attempting to remove it, and, conversely, one can improperly attempt to remove an item even though one properly has possession of it. The allegation that Chauvin possessed the plate without authorization is thus factually and legally distinct from the allegation that he attempted to remove the plate from government premises. The board incorrectly analyzed the charges as a single act of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tompkins v. USPS</span>, 415 Fed. Appx. 226, 227-28 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), reiterated <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tompkins was employed at the Postal Service's Atlanta Processing and Distribution Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He was removed from his position based upon the charge of "improper conduct: unauthorized opening, obstruction, and possession of the mail." The charge grew out of an incident in which, the agency alleged, Mr. Tompkins removed a camcorder from the mail, possessed it without authorization, and converted it to his own use.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tompkins's first argument is that the AJ erred as a matter of law in viewing the charge of improper conduct as consisting of three separate acts or specifications, rather than as one allegation with three elements. Mr. Tompkins argues that, if the AJ had correctly viewed the charge as a single allegation with three elements, the agency would have had to prove each element in order for the charge to be sustained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 174, 178-79 (1994). As noted, the AJ found that the Postal Service had failed to prove that Mr. Tompkins had opened the package containing the camcorder. Therefore, Mr. Tompkins reasons, the Board erred in sustaining the charge against him because one of three elements of the charge was not established.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, where a single charge consists of three separate acts or specifications of misconduct "that are not dependent upon each other and that do not comprise a single, separable event," each act or specification constitutes a separate charge. <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, <span id="Page_3199"></span>38 F.3d 563, 565 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In such a case, the agency need only prove one of the specifications in order to have the charge sustained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 147 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("'[w]here more than one event or factual allegation is set out to support a single charge..., proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in the AJ's ruling with respect to the charge against Mr. Tompkins. Each of the three acts which the Postal Service alleged against Mr. Tompkins involved separate and distinct activity which could be undertaken without performing either of the other two acts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bockas v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3312) (prohibition against charge splitting applies in arbitration).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, <span class="Italic">Lanza v. Dept. of Army</span>, 67 MSPR 516, 520 (1995), determined that when a single stated charge contains two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent upon each other and do not comprise a single, inseparable event, each act constitutes a separate charge. The agency essentially issued two charges when it accused the appellant of improperly loaning his cellular telephone to another and improperly making long-distance calls with the telephone. <span class="Italic">Lanza</span> concluded that when the agency charged the appellant with making improper long distance calls with the cellular phone, that the agency had to prove more than unauthorized use of the telephone to make calls: the agency had to prove that the calls were long distance. This result was reached because the agency bears the burden of proving each of the elements of its charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 202, 206 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) ("Here, the agency charged the appellant with 'failure to follow verbal directives and lying to your supervisor.' These allegations describe two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent upon each other, and that do not comprise a single, inseparable event, i.e., the allegation that the appellant failed to follow verbal directives is factually and legally distinct from the allegation that he lied to his supervisor. Accordingly, we have considered these allegations as two separate charges. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, 38 F.3d at 565."); <span class="Italic">cf. Crawford v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-21-0069-I-1 (NP 3/29/2022) ("When determining whether an agency has proved its charge, the Board distinguishes between facts supporting a charge, and an element of a charge that must be proven for the charge to be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Diaz v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 415, 420 (1993) (explaining that the Board distinguishes between 'factual recitations supporting a charge whose essential nature does not change and a charge encompassing more than one element, each of which changes the nature of the charge')."); <span class="Italic">Payne v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened this case because, although the appellant has not raised the issue at any point in his appeal, we find that the administrative judge improperly split the charge that the appellant "provided false or misleading information not consistent with medical documentation as reasons for not being at work" on August 7-10 and August 16-17, 2006. The administrative judge sustained the charge upon finding that the information the appellant provided to Mr. Vidal was "misleading and most certainly inconsistent," but that he was "not convinced that the evidence proves the medical information or excuses offered by the appellant for August 7-10 and 16-17, 2006, were false."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove a falsification charge, the agency must prove that the appellant gave the agency false information with the intent to deceive or mislead. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 978 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Further, the agency has the burden to prove all the elements of the charged offense. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). By finding that the agency failed to prove that the appellant intended to deceive or mislead the agency when he offered the medical documentation, and sustaining the charge upon finding that the agency proved only that the appellant provided misleading but not false information, we find that the administrative judge did not hold the agency to its burden to prove all elements of the charge, and so the charge may not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172; <span class="Italic">Naekel</span>, 782 F.2d at 982; <span class="Italic">George v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although a charge may not be split, the Board examines the charge and the supporting specifications to determine whether the charge is unified, i.e., whether its elements are inseparable, or whether components of the charge, although grammatically linked, are separately stated and may be separately proved, <span class="Italic">James v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 300, 303-05 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's notice of proposed removal based the action on the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">failure to comply with instructions regarding your absence from duty beginning 1 September 1995 and continuing through the present date <span class="Italic">and your associated unauthorized absence since that date.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Emphasis added. The specifications of the charge state that the appellant's absence as of September 1, 1995, "is now being recorded as AWOL." Although both the charge and the specifications of the charge refer to the appellant's unauthorized absence or AWOL, the administrative judge found that there was a single charge of "failure to comply with instructions relating to his absence from duty." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In resolving the issue of how charges in the proposal notice are to be construed, the structure and language of the notice must be examined. <span class="Italic">Schifano v. Veterans Administration</span>, 70 MSPR 275, 279 (1996). While an agency is required to state the reason for a proposed adverse action in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply, the charge must be viewed in light of the accompanying specifications and circumstances, and should not be technically construed. <span class="Italic">Spearman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the court found that the Board could not split a single charge into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represented only a portion of the original. However, the court contrasted that with a situation where more than one event or factual specification is set out to support a single charge<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> was charged with one act ("directing" the use of government resources) consisting of two elements (unauthorized use of government materials and for other than official purposes), whereas here, the appellant was charged with having committed two separate acts of misconduct (failure to comply with instructions and AWOL) that are not dependent on each other and do not together comprise a single inseparable event. Whether the agency described these events under one heading or any number of different forms of emphasis is irrelevant under <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>; what matters is whether the agency charged the appellant with one act having several elements, or with two or more acts. <span class="Italic">Fairley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 545, 548 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the first paragraph in both the notice and decision letters includes the "unauthorized absence" language. Further, the specifications in paragraphs 2a and 2b of the notice notified the appellant that if he failed to report for duty or provide supporting medical documentation by October 2, 1995, his absence would be unauthorized. It also notified him that as of September 1, 1995, he was AWOL. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition, the decision letter stated that the reasons in paragraph 1 of the notice of proposed removal and the details in paragraphs 2a through 2b of that letter are fully supported and sustained by the evidence. Moreover, the deciding official, Ms. Vance, testified that she found unauthorized absence for over sixty days to be very serious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, Ms. Vance's testimony concerning the appellant's unauthorized absence is somewhat unclear, in that it also provides some support for the administrative judge's finding that the agency brought only one charge. When questioned as to why the appellant was removed from his position, Ms. Vance replied that "Steve was removed because he did not comply with his supervisor's instructions." Further, the written penalty rationale, which she testified was based on her consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and was attached to the decision letter, stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The AFI-36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions, table of penalties in attachment 3 specifies the following disciplinary action for the cited offense which most closely equates to the reason for this decision to remove. The penalty range for the first offense is shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">#20 Failure to comply with instructions: Reprimand to removal</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">While I am not personally aware of penalties rendered in cases of similar offenses with similar circumstances, a removal from federal service is considered reasonable and consistent with the table of penalties for a first offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, contrary to her statement that she found the appellant's unauthorized absence to be very serious, this portion of her testimony and the penalty rationale provide some support for a conclusion that she based her decision only on the failure to comply with instructions charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that this inconsistency does not defeat the AWOL charge. The notice of proposed removal and the decision letter clearly informed the appellant that he was charged with unauthorized absence. Further, the agency argued throughout the proceedings below that the appellant had been charged AWOL from September 1, 1995. Moreover, in a March 12, 1996, pre-hearing conference memorandum, the administrative judge acknowledged the two separate charges and accepted both as issues in the case. Thus, the appellant was on clear notice that he was charged with two distinct independent acts, failure to comply with instructions <span class="Italic">and</span> unauthorized absence or AWOL. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge erred in not considering and determining the charge that the appellant's absence from September 1, 1995, until his return on November 6, 1995, was unauthorized (AWOL). <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained how a single charge may carry distinct elements <span id="Page_3200"></span>without improper charge splitting in <span class="Italic">Fairley v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 545, 547-49 (1994), involving the allegation that the appellant pushed a subordinate and threatened her with physical harm. There were two independent elements of the charge, either or both supporting discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened the appeal because it raises an issue addressed by the court in <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the court confronted a factual setting in which the agency charged the appellant with "directing the unauthorized use of Government materials, manpower and equipment for other than official purposes." <span class="Italic">See Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 171. The agency based its charge on the appellant's instruction to an agency machinist to fabricate a part that was allegedly to be used for an agency project. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> On appeal to the Board, the administrative judge sustained the charge, finding that the work at issue had been done for an official purpose but had not been authorized; the Board affirmed the administrative judge's initial decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 171-72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court reversed, holding that the Board could not split a single charge into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represented only a portion of the original. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172. It held that if the agency could not prove one of the elements of the charge, then the entire charge must fall. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. However, the court also contrasted the facts of the case with the situation where more than one event or factual specification is set out to support a single charge. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In that situation, it observed, proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications would be enough to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeal before us presents such a situation. The conduct described by the charge in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> involved only one act, directing a machinist to fabricate a part, that the agency alleged had two characteristics: it was unauthorized, and it was done for other than official purposes. Here, although the agency charged the appellant with pushing an employee and threatening her with physical harm under the heading "Charge # 1," the evidence of record shows that two distinct, independent events formed the basis for its action. Statements in the record from the appellant, from the employee the appellant was charged with pushing and threatening, and from a supervisor who witnessed the confrontation between the two, confirm that two separate events occurred: The appellant made contact with Ms. Shea's face in some manner, and then stated that she would slap or punch Ms. Shea unless Ms. Shea left the area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> thus was charged with one act ("directing" the use of government resources) consisting of two elements, while the appellant here was charged with having committed two separate acts of misconduct ("pushing" a co-worker and "threatening" her) that are not dependent on each other and do not together comprise a single inseparable event. Whether the agency described these acts under one heading or any of a number of different forms of emphasis is irrelevant under <span class="Italic">Burroughs;</span> what matters is whether the agency charged the appellant with one act having several elements, or with two or more acts. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained what he termed "the first part of the agency's charge" (pushing) but did not sustain "the second part of the agency's charge" (threatening). In doing so, however, he did not split one act into its various elements, as in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, and then sustain a newly-formulated charge based on one of those elements. Rather, he merely found that the appellant had committed one of the acts charged (pushing) and not the other (threatening). The administrative judge thus did not commit reversible error under <span class="Italic">Burroughs. See</span> 918 F.2d at 172.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALVARADO_ANGEL_H_DE_0752_03_0048_B_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247784.pdf">103 MSPR 1</a>, 7-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-22, 2006 MSPB 230 (2006), abstrusely distinguished a single stated charge containing two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent upon each other and that do not comprise a single, inseparable event--each act constituting a separate charge--and a charge that is based on more than one act that can be divided into multiple specifications or charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...the agency charged the appellant as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The reason this action is being proposed is because of your insubordinate defiance of authority and failure to comply with minimum standards of conduct as demonstrated by your careless workmanship, certification of inaccurate information on inspection checklists and misuse of government equipment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the next paragraph, the agency stated, "The specific reasons used to support this proposed action are the 24 different discrepancies that have occurred since April 2002." After a brief discussion concerning the 24 discrepancies, the agency stated, without a paragraph break, "Additionally, you misused equipment belonging to the United States Government and did so during your duty hours."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This charge is anything but clear, but we are bound to decide this case according to how the charge is written, not how it could or should have been written. The agency is required to prove the charge as it is set out in the notice of proposed removal, not some other offense that might be sustainable by the facts of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Spruill v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 17 (1999); <span class="Italic">Holderness v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 401, 404&#8209;05 (1997). The AJ construed this language as containing two charges, one charge of "insubordinate defiance of authority and failure to comply with minimum standards of conduct," a single charge comprised of two elements, and one charge of misuse of government equipment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency further asserts that the charge is correctly construed "as alleging [the] appellant's failure to perform his duties as evidenced by the 24 specifications as aggravated by the disrespectful nature of the failure to perform." In the alternative, the agency alleges that there are two charges, "one alleging [the] appellant's failure to perform his duties and one alleging insubordinate conduct." In either case, the agency contends that the allegation regarding the appellant's alleged misuse of government equipment was intended to be a specification of other charges, not a separate charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in the AJ's determination that the allegation regarding the misuse of government equipment constitutes a separate charge. When a single stated charge contains two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent upon each other and that do not comprise a single, inseparable event, each act constitutes a separate charge. <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 565 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, the agency charged the appellant with "unauthorized possession and attempted removal of Government property." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 564. In construing the charge, the court found that the allegation that the appellant possessed the item in question without authorization and the allegation that he attempted to remove it were legally and factually distinct and constituted two separate acts that were not a single, inseparable event and were not dependent upon each other. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 565. The court determined that the agency thus brought two charges, one unauthorized possession charge and one attempted removal charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reasoning employed in <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span> is directly applicable in this case. Unlike the remainder of the charged misconduct, the alleged misuse of government equipment pertains to a single incident in which the appellant admittedly used a government video cassette recorder on agency premises to play a videotape promoting his band. All of the remaining alleged misconduct pertains to the manner in which the appellant did or did not perform the vehicle maintenance inspections that were his primary duty. The misuse of government equipment allegation is clearly unrelated to the remaining allegations, is based on completely different facts, and requires entirely different elements of proof. Under <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, therefore, the AJ correctly construed the misuse of government equipment allegation as a separate charge. <span class="Italic">Chauvin</span>, 38 F.3d at 565.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the remainder of the allegations against the appellant. Generally speaking, a charge usually consists of two parts: (1) A name or label that generally characterizes the misconduct; and (2) a narrative description of the acts that constitute the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 203 (1997). While an agency is not required to affix a label to a charge of misconduct, if it chooses to label an act of misconduct, it is bound to prove the elements that make up the legal definition of that charge, if there are any. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 202. The Board may not split a single charge into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Whether the prohibition against charge-splitting applies depends on whether the charge is based on a single act or on more than one act. <span class="Italic">Acox v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 111, 114 (1997). A charge that is based on more than one act can be divided into multiple specifications or charges, each corresponding to the separate acts alleged. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the agency's charge is based on a single act, the agency must prove all the elements of the charge that it brings based on that act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Picariello v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6; 7 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 215 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> charged the appellant with directing the unauthorized use of Government resources for other than official purposes. <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 171. This presented a situation involving one charge with multiple elements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 172. The appellant engaged in only one act of misconduct (directing the unauthorized use of Government resources); hence, there could be only one charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Fairley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 545, 548 (1994). However, because the agency's charge in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> stated that the appellant had directed the <span class="Italic">unauthorized</span> use of Government resources <span class="Italic">for other than official purposes</span>, the agency was required to prove that the appellant directed the use of Government resources, <span class="Italic">and</span> that that use was unauthorized, <span class="Italic">and</span> that that use was for other than official purposes. <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172. Therefore, there was one charge, but with multiple elements, and the agency was bound to prove all elements or its charge could not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3201"></span>In <span class="Italic">Fairley</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 548, the agency charged the appellant with pushing an employee and threatening her with physical harm. In contrast to the situation in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the record in <span class="Italic">Fairley</span> showed that the misconduct consisted of two separate acts, pushing and threatening. <span class="Italic">Fairley</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 548. Under those circumstances, the Board found that there was one charge with multiple factual specifications set out in support of the charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Under <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172, proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge. Because the agency in <span class="Italic">Fairley</span> proved the "pushing" specification, but not the "threatening" specification, the charge in <span class="Italic">Fairley</span> was sustained. <span class="Italic">Fairley</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 549.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 174, 178 (1994), the agency charged the appellant with "deliberate malpractice and falsification." The Board found that the appellant engaged in a single act in which she used someone else's initials on an inspection approval tag. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board interpreted the charge as a single charge with multiple elements ("deliberate malpractice" and "falsification"), both of which the agency had to prove in order for the charge to be sustained. <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 178-79; <span class="Italic">see also Acox</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 114 (a charge of "verbal abuse and physical threats," where each specification under the charge consisted of a single act, required the agency to prove both elements of "verbal abuse" and "physical threat"); <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 397, 401-02 (1997) (a charge of insolence and rudeness, where each specification under the charge consisted of a single act, required the agency to prove both elements of "insolence" and "rudeness"). The Board found that the AJ erred by splitting the charge into separate charges of "deliberate malpractice" and "falsification." <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 179.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also relevant in this appeal is the Board's precedent concerning when charges should be merged. Charges should be merged when they are improperly duplicative in nature. <span class="Italic">Southers v. Veterans Administration</span>, 813 F.2d 1223, 1225 (Fed. Cir. 1987). A general charge such as "conduct unbecoming a Federal employee" should be merged into a more specific charge, such as falsification, when both charges are based on the same acts. <span class="Italic">Mann v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 1, 6 (1998); <span class="Italic">see Gunn v.

When two charges are based on the same act of misconduct and proof of one charge automatically constitutes proof of the other, the charges should be merged. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 139 Fed. Appx. 261 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 7. Merger is not appropriate where proof of a single act does not automatically result in proof of multiple charges. <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the agency's arguments on review, we note that nowhere in the two paragraphs of the notice of proposed removal in which the appellant's misconduct is described does the phrase "failure to perform your duties" appear. We find unpersuasive the agency's post-hoc attempt to recharacterize its confusing and imprecise language as a charge of failure to perform duties. That may be what the agency believed that the appellant did, but that is not the label that the agency affixed to what the appellant did. As noted above, given that the agency chose to affix a label to the appellant's misconduct, it is bound to prove the elements that make up the legal definition of the label it chose. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the reference in the charge to "careless workmanship, certification of inaccurate information on inspection checklists" is merely descriptive and is not part of the charge's label. This is shown by the fact that this language follows the phrase "as demonstrated by," which evidences that the language preceding the phrase "as demonstrated by" is the operative language at issue in construing the charge. Thus, the AJ did not err by focusing on the language preceding the phrase "as demonstrated by" in construing the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree, however, with the AJ's determination that the language "insubordinate defiance of authority and failure to comply with minimum standards of conduct" constitutes one charge with two elements. There is nothing in the notice of proposed removal, the hearing testimony, or anywhere else in the record to indicate that the reference in this particular case to "standards of conduct" should be interpreted to refer to a document containing written standards of conduct. Instead of a list of enumerated rules that employees are expected to follow, the "standards of conduct" referred to in this appeal appear to be nothing more than unwritten but accepted norms of workplace behavior. We find, therefore, that the "failure to comply with minimum standards of conduct" portion of the charge is akin to a charge of "improper conduct."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge of "improper conduct" has no specific elements of proof; it is established by proving that the appellant committed the acts alleged in support of the "improper conduct" label. <span class="Italic">Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 204. The same 24 specifications of misconduct support both the "insubordinate defiance of authority" and the "failure to comply with minimum standards of conduct" portions of the charge. If the agency proves "insubordinate defiance of authority," we can imagine no scenario in which it will not also have proven "failure to comply with minimum standards of conduct." Therefore, the "failure to comply with minimum standards of conduct" language merges into the remainder of the charge. <span class="Italic">See Bross v. Department of Commerce</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 2 n.1 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 389 F.3d 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2004). We find that the agency has charged the appellant with 24 specifications of "insubordinate defiance of authority."</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit considered a charge that was split with a slash and decided the Board appropriately considered there were two separate charges, <span class="Italic">Texeira v. USPS</span>, 267 Fed. Appx. 950, 951-52 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In January of 2005, Texeira was supervisor of five window clerks and several floor clerks, and she was also finance supervisor at the Modesto Main Post Office. She had been a supervisor for about seven years, a postal employee for about nineteen years, and had no prior record of misconduct. On January 26, however, Texeira incorrectly posted 160 hours of annual leave for an employee she was supervising. The employee had not yet earned the leave, never earned it, and later returned the leave pay to the agency. When the agency learned about and investigated Texeira's incorrect timekeeping entry, the manager of customer service at the Modesto Main Post Office served her with a notice of removal from federal service. The initial charge was a simple statement that she had incorrectly posted the unearned leave for an employee she was supervising. That notice of removal was revised on August 2, 2005 with a more detailed description of the conduct involved in her incorrect posting of annual leave, including a listing of several Postal Service rules and regulations that she allegedly had violated. The notice stated: "Charge: Unacceptable Conduct: Falsification in Recording Time/Failure to Follow Proper Timekeeping Procedures."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The AJ considered the agency charge as two charges, one for falsification of time records and the other for failure to follow proper timekeeping procedures. The AJ found the agency did not prove falsification but did prove the lesser charge. The AJ then upheld the same substantial penalty the agency had imposed for both charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his decision the AJ first addressed Texeira's argument that the agency had asserted a single charge against her that could not be divided into a greater charge and a lesser charge. The AJ held, based on <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Navy,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 309, 318 (1993), that a single act of misconduct could be read as presenting multiple charges, so long as each required different elements of proof. Noting that the agency decisionmaker Sarno testified at the Board hearing that he considered the agency's allegation to be a single charge, the AJ nevertheless decided the agency's charge label gave rise to both the alleged falsification of recorded earned leave, and a separate alleged failure to follow proper timekeeping procedures. The AJ wrote that proof of an intent to deceive was an element of the charge of "Falsification in Recording Time," but that an intent element was not required to prove failure to comply with proper timekeeping procedures. He dismissed the falsification charge as unproved, but found the agency had proved the second charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the charge separation issue, we agree with the AJ's analysis and conclusion. The AJ correctly decided that the agency's charge label gave rise to two separate charges, one falsification of recorded earned leave, and the other the failure to follow proper timekeeping procedures. Plainly the charge of "Falsification in Recording Time" required proof of an intent to deceive, an element not required to prove timekeeping or record keeping errors. Consequently, the AJ properly analyzed the two types of timekeeping offenses separately and had the authority to find the agency had proved the lesser charge but not the charge requiring intent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether a single charge may be split can depend on the relatedness of the components of the charge. Like clauses in a sentence, some charges are more dependent than others. The Board explained its theory of relatedness, <span class="Italic">Coyle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 62 MSPR 241, 245 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Failure to support each element of a charge by the requisite burden of proof results in a finding that the entire charge must fail. <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172. When a single stated charge contains two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent on each other and do not comprise a single inseparable event, however, each distinct element may be sustained as a separate charge. <span class="Italic">See Fairley v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, <span id="Page_3202"></span>MSPB Docket No. BNO75291027211, slip op. at 5 (Feb. 8, 1994) (one single charge describing two separate events not dependent on each other, "pushing" and "threatening," effectively constituted two separate charges), <span class="Italic">citing Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the agency stated one single "reason" for the appellant's removal, continuously engaging in unprofessional conduct in dealing with taxpayers and in responding to her supervisor. We find that this "reason" is effectively separated into two distinct charges, each independent of the other, i.e., unprofessional conduct in dealing with taxpayers and unprofessional conduct in responding to her supervisor<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Picariello v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 126, 130 &#x00B6; 7 (1998), the charge was violation of agency standards of conduct. The specifications included verbal and physical assault, as well as failure to follow instructions. The AJ erred by dismissing the charge on a finding that there was no verbal assault. The specification involved two separate acts. A determination that a physical assault occurred sustained the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency's charge is based on a single act, the agency must prove all of the elements of the charge that it brings based on that act. <span class="Italic">See Acox v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 76 MSPR 111, 114 (1997). Here, the agency's charge was based on multiple acts. In its first specification, the agency alleged that the appellant violated U.S. Postal standards of conduct when, in response to his supervisor's request to sign a limited-duty job offer, he verbally assaulted the supervisor by becoming belligerent and saying "fuck you" and when he physically assaulted his supervisor by walking up to his supervisor, grabbing him by the collar of his shirt, along with his tie, and applying pressure to his throat. Since the specification involves two separate acts and physically assaulting one's supervisor violates the agency's standards of conduct, the agency was not required to prove both that the appellant physically and verbally assaulted his supervisor in order to have its physical assault specification sustained. <span class="Italic">Cf. Acox,</span> 76 MSPR at 114 (since each of the specifications under the agency charge of "verbal abuse and physical threats" was based on a separate single statement, the agency was required to prove, with respect to each specification, that the particular statement was both "verbal abuse" and a "physical threat"). Accordingly, we sustain the agency's physical assault specification. The agency's charge, therefore, is supported by three proven specifications. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (where more than one event or factual specification supports a single charge, proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brott v. GSA</span>, 116 MSPR 410, 411-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4-7, 10-11, 2011 MSPB 52 (2011) (overruled in part by <span class="Italic">Southerland v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SOUTHERLAND_ROBERT_SF_0752_09_0864_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_OPINION_832922.pdf">119 MSPR 566</a>, 2013 MSPB 46 (2013)), declined to consider as independent charges two elements of a charge that were related but that appeared to support independent analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency charged the appellant with the following misconduct: (1) On July 23, 2008, disorderly conduct and failure to follow instruction, specifically, using abusive language to a coworker, while loading the packing belt line, and leaving the facility when his supervisor ordered him to stop using abusive language; (2) on July 24, 2008, failure to follow instructions to report to the facility manager, James Gorman, regarding the incident of July 23, 2008, and absence without leave (AWOL); (3) on July 25, 2008, AWOL; and, (4) on August 20, 2008, disorderly conduct, specifically, using abusive language to two coworkers and throwing a 25 lb box containing caustic material onto the floor....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge...found that, to prove charge (1), the agency must establish by preponderant evidence both disorderly conduct and failure to follow instructions. She found that, when the appellant's supervisor, Edward Ashley, ordered the appellant to stop using abusive language or leave, the appellant said that he would leave the facility. She found that the appellant left and that the agency granted him annual leave for the remainder of the work day. She found that therefore the agency failed to prove that the appellant did not follow instructions and thus failed to prove the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As with charge (1), the administrative judge found that to prove charge (2), the agency must establish by preponderant evidence both failure to follow instructions and AWOL. The administrative judge found that the agency proved the charged misconduct. However, she noted that the appellant testified that he had a reason for not following the order. She noted that the appellant testified that he did not want to see Gorman while he (the appellant) was upset. She noted that the appellant testified that he had to do his "cussing" outside.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to charge (4), the administrative judge found that the appellant's alleged abusive language and swinging and throwing a box on the floor comprised a single inseparable event....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge's findings with respect to the charges were correct.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge usually consists of two parts: (1) A name or label that generally characterizes the misconduct; and (2) a narrative description of the acts that constitute the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 203 (1977). The Board may not split a single charge into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the court used the term "charge" to apply to the charge's label, holding that when an agency names a charge so that the label has more than one element, then the agency must prove all of the elements for the overall charge to be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge properly found that to prove its charges, the agency must have proven all the elements of the label of each charge. Applying <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency failed to prove the charge of disorderly conduct and failure to follow instructions on July 23, 2008. We also find that the administrative judge properly did not sustain the charges of AWOL on July 25, 2008, and disorderly conduct on August 20, 2008.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant raises an affirmative defense as to a charge, and if that defense is sustained as to one of the narrative specifications of the charge, the charge as a whole may be barred, as in <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370, 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (following remand, ordering reinstatement, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <span class="blue">116 MSPR 17</span>, 2011 MSPB 7 (2011)), involving a defense of whistleblower reprisal to a charge that included several disclosures, some not protected, and one found to be protected (the charge was that appellant, Chief of the U.S. Park Police, made public remarks regarding security on the federal mall, in parks, and on the parkways in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the sole specification for charge 2 is grounded in a WPA-protected disclosure, the charge cannot stand. Vice Chairman Rose stated that she would sustain the whole of charge 2 as she found no WPA-protected disclosures. Chairman McPhie noted that he would sustain charge 2, reasoning that "the non-protected statements made by [Chambers] to the <span class="Italic">Washington Post</span> were alone sufficient to sustain Charge 2." <span class="Italic">Chambers III,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. at 337. However, the law is clear that such charge-splitting is impermissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have explained that "[w]hen an agency proposes to discipline an employee, it must notify the employee of the conduct with which he is charged 'in sufficient detail to permit the employee to make an informed reply.'" <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 147 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Pope v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 114 F.3d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1997), and <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado,</span> 999 F.2d 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). Agencies typically give this notice by designating a particular charge and accompanying the charge with a narrative description, the "specification," which sets forth the details of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the agency designates a specific charge as the basis for the proposed discipline, it must of course prove all the elements of that charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Where the agency only sets forth one specification, we have long held that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]t is not permissible for the [Board] to split a single charge of an agency into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original charge. If the agency fails to prove one of the elements of its charge, then the entire charge must fall.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Here charge 2 cannot stand.[8] Discipline may not be based on a disclosure protected by the WPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Greenspan v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Because the sole specification set forth to support charge 2 is grounded in at least one WPA-protected disclosure, charge 2 cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The cases Chairman McPhie cites in support of his decision to sustain charge 2 do not hold that a charge may be parsed out and then sustained in part. For example, in <span class="Italic">Greenough v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 648, 656-57 (1997), the agency proved two specifications, but not the third, and the Board held that that was sufficient to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">Greenough</span> does not authorize the Board to sustain a charge where the agency only sets forth one specification in support of the charge, and the charged conduct is grounded in WPA-protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See also Hicks v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 48 F.3d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
