<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-258"><span class="space">b.</span> Unauthorized Possession or Removal of Property; Theft</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">It is useful in analyzing offenses involving property to keep some distinctions in mind. Under the decisions that follow, to sustain a charge of theft, an agency must prove a taking and possession of another's property in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights and benefits, with an intent permanently to deprive the owner of the possession or use of his property. Conversion, however, may be consummated without any intent to keep and without any wrongful taking. Conversion may include misuse or abuse of property.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Overruling some earlier law, <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 456, 459-61 (1991), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 54 MSPR 461, 468 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>, explained the distinctions between theft and unauthorized possession of property:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously confronted the issue of whether theft requires an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the possession of his property, and has reached seemingly contrary conclusions. In <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 10 MSPR 83 (1982), the employee took home a fan belonging to the agency for several days so that his sick wife could gain some relief from the heat. The Board affirmed the presiding official's determination that the employee lacked the requisite criminal intent....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Major v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 283 (1986), the employee took five gallons of gasoline belonging to the agency for use in his personal vehicle. The administrative judge, crediting the employee's testimony that he intended to replace the gasoline at the end of the day, did not sustain the charge of theft because the agency failed to prove an intent to permanently deprive the agency of the gasoline. The Board reversed, finding that the agency was only required to show that the employee converted the government's gasoline to a use inconsistent with the agency's property interest in the gasoline....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Joy</span>, the Board similarly found that an employee who had taken home an agency hard hat had committed theft, notwithstanding his statements that he intended to return the item, because the evidence showed that he intended to appropriate the hard hat to a use which was inconsistent with the agency's rights and benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 24 MSPR at 655-56.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge of theft incorporates the intent to steal, and stealing implies the common law crime of larceny, which generally requires a showing of an intent to permanently deprive the owner of his property. <span class="Italic">Franklin</span>, 10 MSPR at 85. Construing a statute that makes it unlawful to embezzle, steal, purloin, or knowingly convert property belonging to the Federal government, the Supreme Court made the following distinctions between these terms:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Probably every stealing is a conversion, but certainly not every knowing conversion is a stealing. "To steal means to <span class="Italic">take away from one</span> in lawful possession without right with the <span class="Italic">intention to keep wrongfully</span>." Conversion, however, may be consummated without any intent to keep and without any wrongful taking, where the initial possession by the converter was entirely lawful. Conversion may include misuse or abuse of property....&#8197;Money rightfully taken into one's custody may be converted without any intent to keep or embezzle it merely by commingling it with the custodian's own, if he was under a duty to keep it separate and intact. It is not difficult to think of intentional and knowing abuses and unauthorized uses of government property that might be knowing conversions but which could not be reached as embezzlement, stealing or purloining.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Morissette v. United States</span>, 342 U.S. 246, 271-72 (1952) (citation deleted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that, to sustain a charge of theft, an agency must prove a taking and possession of another's property in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights and benefits, with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the possession or use of his property. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Major</span> and <span class="Italic">Joy</span> hold otherwise, they are overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The charge of theft in this case was based entirely on the admission made by the appellant in her affidavit of March 16, 1989. In this affidavit, the appellant said that, upon taking $10.00 belonging to an inmate from an envelope in the mail room to use for lunch, she placed the envelope in the safe so that she could replace the money the next day, and that she in fact replaced the $10.00 the following day. No intent to permanently deprive the inmate of the possession or use of his money can be inferred from these actions. We therefore conclude that the administrative judge erred in sustaining the charge of theft. This is not to say that the appellant's actions were not wrongful. Since the agency only charged the appellant with theft, however, it would be improper for the Board to consider whether the appellant committed any other or lesser offenses, such as conversion or misuse of property entrusted to her care. <span class="Italic">See Major</span>, 31 MSPR at 285 n.1.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On an OPM reconsideration petition, <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v. DOJ</span>, 54 MSPR 461, 465 (1992), noted: "[I]ntent to permanently deprive the owner of possession and use of the property is an element that must be proven to support a charge of theft. The return of the money belied such an intent."). On OPM's judicial review petition, <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663, 665-67 (Fed. Cir. 1994), rejected a relaxed interpretation of theft charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that the Board erred in its correlation of a theft allegation in a personnel action with criminal theft. It argues that an adverse action is not a criminal proceeding and that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978...eliminated hypertechnical pleading requirements in adverse action proceedings. Thus, according to OPM, the Reform Act's notice provision is to afford employees with fair warning of the charges against them so that they can make informed replies. Consequently, the notice provided to any employee (i.e., the charge) must be read in light of the specifications and circumstances and should not be technically construed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board acknowledged that in its prior cases it had reached seemingly contrary conclusions regarding the requisite intent to sustain a theft charge. <span class="Italic">Compare Major v. Department of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 283, 285 (1986) ("The charge of theft...incorporates the intent to appropriate [another's] property to a use inconsistent with the owner's rights and benefits."); <span class="Italic">Joy</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 652, 655 (1984) ("The criminal intent inherent in the charge of theft...requires that the agency show that the employee intended to appropriate the property to a use inconsistent with the [owner]'s rights and benefits.") (citation omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem.</span>, 785 F.2d 322 (Fed. Cir. 1985) <span class="Italic">with Franklin v. Department of Navy</span>, 10 MSPR 83, 85 (1982) ("Stealing implies the common law crime of larceny, which generally requires a showing of an intent to permanently deprive the owner of his property.") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that one of the elements of theft is the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession and use of his or her property. 50 MSPR at 459-60. <span class="Italic">See Morissette v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States</span>, 342 U.S. 246, 271-72 (1952) ("To steal means to <span class="Italic">take away from one</span> in lawful possession without right with the <span class="Italic">intention to keep wrongfully.")</span> (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">Webster's</span> <span class="Italic">New Collegiate Dictionary</span> 1200 (1979) (defining theft as "the act <span id="Page_2787"></span>of stealing," specifically, "the felonious taking and removing of personal property with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it"); <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 1324 (5th ed. 1979) ("Theft is any...act[&#8197;] done with the intent to deprive the owner <span class="Italic">permanently</span> of the possession, use or benefit of his property..."). (Emphasis added). We cannot say that this holding by the Board is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we are convinced that the Agency intended to charge Nazelrod with the crime of theft. While recognizing that an adverse action proceeding under the CSRA does not demand the same technical pleadings and burdens of proof as a criminal proceeding, there is record evidence to support the AJ's finding that "[t]he agency chose to charge [Nazelrod] with committing the criminal offense of theft." Moreover, "theft" is well recognized as referring to criminal conduct. If sustained, the charge in this case essentially would have branded Nazelrod a criminal, a thief. She would thereby be stigmatized more than if she had been charged with a lesser, non-criminal charge--such as a violation of a regulation or an employee conduct standard. It would be unfair to Nazelrod to permit the Agency to brand her a criminal without requiring it to prove the elements commonly associated with the crime. Accordingly, we conclude that the Board was correct in requiring the Agency to prove the requisite criminal intent to sustain the charges of theft against Nazelrod.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on its view that the CSRA only requires fair notice to the employee of the misconduct, OPM also argues that when the heading "Theft" is read in light of the specification, Nazelrod simply was charged with taking ten dollars and using it to buy lunch, not with the common law crime of larceny. OPM contends that the heading "Theft" was merely a label to describe the facts set forth in the specification. Because the Agency proved that Nazelrod took the ten dollars and used it to buy lunch, OPM argues that the Agency proved its charge and satisfied the requirements of the CSRA. The substance of OPM's argument seems to be that any charge against an employee, regardless of how it may be labelled, should be sustained if the Agency proves what is set out in the specification as the misconduct. Thus, OPM states in its brief: "That the bureau here chose to caption as 'theft' the conduct more fully described in its accompanying specification changes nothing, and cannot elevate the standard of proof needed to establish that Ms. Nazelrod took and used another's money, as was charged and admitted."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject this position because it conflicts with the controlling case law of this court. We have mandated that the agency must prove all of the elements of the substantive offense with which an individual is charged....&#8197;Moreover, it is the burden of the agency to prove the requisite intent if intent is an element of the offense charged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the Agency chose to charge Nazelrod with the offense of theft, not some lesser offense. The Agency is required to prove what is charged, not some lesser offense that might be sustainable by the facts of the specifications. For these reasons, we conclude that OPM's argument is inconsistent with our case law and must be rejected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the element of intent as defined by the Board, the Agency in this case had to prove that Nazelrod intended to permanently deprive the owner of possession of the ten dollars she took from the envelope. The AJ found that Nazelrod did not intend to permanently deprive the owner of the ten dollars, and OPM does not contest this finding. Therefore, the Board properly held that the Agency failed to sustain the charge of theft.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For some years the Board treated the offenses of theft and unauthorized possession of government property as the same. <span class="Italic">Joy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 652, 656 (1984), <span class="Italic">overruled by</span> <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 456, 460 (1991), declared as to an employee's prolonged personal use of a hardhat belonging to an agency warehouse:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine the appellant's intent, we must focus on the question of whether he intended to appropriate the hard hat to a use which was inconsistent with the agency's rights and benefits. The appellant testified directly about this matter. He stated that he had had the hard hat for about a year, but that he intended to bring it back. When he was questioned as to <span class="Italic">when</span> he intended to bring it back, the appellant stated that he intended to do so when he quit or retired from his position with the agency. The appellant agreed that this could have been upon his retirement 13 years hence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on appellant's own testimony, we find that the agency has shown that appellant appropriated the hard hat to a use which was inconsistent with the agency's rights and benefits. The agency has, therefore, established the requisite intent to sustain the charge of theft of the hard hat.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the presiding official based his determination of appellant's lack of intent upon the appellant's testimony that he did not intend to permanently deprive the agency of its gasoline. The presiding official's reliance on appellant's statements, with regard to his subjective intent or state of mind at the time he took the gasoline, was legal error.</p>
