<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-403"><span class="space">7.</span> Precautionary Measures</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was nonnegotiable that management avoid assigning employees to work in isolated areas unless it had also assigned a supervisor, security person, or some other person the responsibility for watching over those isolated areas. The proposal conditioned one work assignment on another and directly interfered with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 471-73 (1987) (Proposal 19). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-114.html#sec6-115">Safety Restrictions; Risks to Safety and Health</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-14-066.html#sec6-67">Job Content; Work Assignment</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Some surveillance measures are negotiable as arrangements. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 189 (1993), considered Proposal 12:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No employee shall be allowed to work in an area beyond the visibility of others, without periodic checks being made by the supervisor, other employees, or security personnel. No employee shall be allowed to work in confined or enclosed spaces without either mechanical or natural ventilation without having someone posted outside equipped with necessary protective equipment to effect a safe rescue.</p>
<p class="noindent">A portion of Proposal 12 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345</span> was negotiable, 48 FLRA at 190-91:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Proposal 12 "is an appropriate arrangement for employees assigned work in remote areas or enclosed spaces." We interpret that assertion to mean that the proposal is intended to be an appropriate arrangement, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3), for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. For the purpose of analysis, we will assume that the first sentence is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of Proposal 12 benefits employees by assuring that others will check on them when they are working in isolated locations, thereby reducing the likelihood of injury. However, by its terms, the first sentence is applicable to every situation in which an employee is assigned to work in an isolated area and would require that management assign someone to check on employees in each instance. The Union does not allege, the record does not show, and it is not otherwise apparent that most, or even many, such assignments would put employees in jeopardy. Moreover, the first sentence would apply even if the assignment resulted in only temporary isolation. In this regard, the Agency points out, without challenge from the Union, that the first sentence would apply when management directs an employee to obtain medicine or supplies from a remote area. We find, on balance, that the blanket prohibition on making any isolated assignments without providing for periodic surveillance imposes a burden on management that outweighs the benefit to employees afforded by periodic checks on their condition. Consequently, we conclude that the first sentence of Proposal 12 is not an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reach a different conclusion concerning the second sentence of Proposal 12.&#x2003;The sentence covers employees assigned to work in enclosed areas without either mechanical or natural ventilation. It is obvious, in this regard, that working in enclosed locations lacking ventilation is intrinsically dangerous. As the risks inherent in such assignments are clear and apparent, we find, consistent with the Union's assertion, that the requirement to assign another employee nearby is an arrangement, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3), for employees adversely affected by the assignment of hazardous work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also clear and apparent that employees who are directed by management to work in areas without mechanical or natural ventilation would benefit from having assistance nearby in case they become disabled as a result of the assignment.&#x2003;Further, the benefit to such employees could be substantial because someone with the appropriate equipment would be nearby to rescue the worker and eliminate or reduce the chance of injury. In addition, unlike the first sentence of Proposal 12, even temporary assignments in such areas involve great risk to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, as the Agency asserts, the requirement to assign an employee nearby imposes a burden during a period when it is obligated to reduce staffing. However, in our view, this burden is more than offset by the likelihood that someone stationed nearby, while an employee is working at a dangerous location, could prevent the employee's injury or death. Moreover, we have no basis on which to conclude that such hazardous assignments occur frequently. Therefore, we conclude that the benefit afforded employees by the second sentence of Proposal 12 outweighs the burden it imposes on management's rights. Accordingly, we find that the second sentence does not excessively interfere with management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(B) and section 7106(b)(1) to assign work and determine the number of employees assigned to a work project. As the second sentence of Proposal 12 does not excessively interfere with management's rights, it is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">Dunbar Branch Office</span> 37 FLRA at 358-61.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-68 and DOD, Missouri NG</span>, 42 FLRA 639, 640, 643-46 (1991), was a portion of Provision 3, that drivers not be required to operate certain vehicles unless the agency complied with the requirements imposed "by appropriate statute and regulation":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that sections A(2) and B merely require "compliance with already established rules and regulations...." The Union's statement <span id="page_916"></span>is consistent with the plain wording of section A(2). Accordingly, for the purposes of this decision, we interpret section A(2) as requiring the Agency to comply with existing statutory and regulatory requirements concerning driver certifications and escort vehicles in connection with the operation of overlong, overwide, and overweight vehicles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that require an agency to restrict work assignments to "qualified" personnel directly interfere with the exercise of management's right to assign work.... Moreover, proposals establishing substantive conditions on the right to assign work directly interfere with that right.... Section A(2) and B would prohibit the Agency, absent an emergency, from requiring employees to perform certain work (operating overwide, overweight, or overlong vehicles) unless the employees were certified or the Agency provided escort vehicles. Even in emergency situations, section B would require escort vehicles. As such, sections A(2) and B impose substantive conditions on the Agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.... [H]owever, we reject the Agency's unsupported claim that these sections would affect its right to determine the personnel by which Agency operations shall be conducted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although sections A(2) and B impose substantive conditions on the Agency's right to assign work, the Authority has previously held that provisions that require an agency to exercise its management rights in accordance with existing legal requirements of law and regulation are negotiable. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1497 and Department of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado</span>, 9 FLRA 151, 156 (1982). The Authority held that such provisions did not interfere with the exercise of management's rights because they merely required an agency to comply with existing external limitations on those rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, however, the Authority reexamined its previous approach to this issue in light of the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>). In that case, the Court held that, with respect to management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, the Statute "does not empower unions to enforce all 'external limitations' on management rights, but only limitations contained in 'applicable laws.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1628. In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 42 FLRA No. 31 (1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), we held that, insofar as management rights under section 7106(a)(2) are concerned, proposals requiring compliance with applicable laws do not interfere with the exercise of such rights. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Department of Education Council of AFGE Locals and U.S. Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1075-76 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, 39 FLRA 1241 (1991), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">United States Department of Education v. FLRA</span>, No. 91-1219 (D.C. Cir. May 10, 1991) (proposals requiring management to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute in accordance with applicable laws directly interfere with the exercise of such rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also held, for reasons discussed fully in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, that the term "applicable laws" in section 7106(a)(2) includes, among other things, provisions in the United States Code as well as rules and regulations having "the force and effect of law." 42 FLRA No. 31, slip op. at 15. As relevant here, we held that agency regulations must have certain substantive and procedural characteristics in order to constitute regulations having the force and effect of law. Specifically, agency regulations have the force and effect of law, so as to constitute "applicable laws," if they: (1) are promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; (2) affect individual rights and obligations, and (3) are promulgated in accordance with applicable procedural requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., slip op. at 15-17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Union does not identify the "appropriate statute and regulation" to which section A(2) refers. Therefore, we are unable to determine whether, consistent with <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, sections A(2) and B require compliance with "applicable laws." However, as noted previously, insofar as the sections do require such compliance, they do not directly interfere with the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) and are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, even assuming that the sections refer to existing requirements that do not constitute applicable laws, we find that they are negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute for two reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, consistent with the Union's assertion that Provision 3 constitutes an appropriate arrangement, it is reasonable to conclude that the operation of overlong, overwide, or overweight vehicles involves special safety concerns. It also is reasonable to conclude, in connection with these vehicles, that existing statutory and regulatory requirements involving driver certifications and escort vehicles address these concerns. Sections A(2) and B would mitigate the adverse effects on employees of being deprived of the protections afforded by these requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1078 (Authority noted employees' interest in "maintaining the protections afforded them under...laws, rules, and regulations").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, these sections relate, by their terms, only to certifications and escort vehicles that are "required by appropriate statute and regulation...." That is, the sections do not establish any requirements beyond those already existing. Moreover, the Agency does not dispute the existence of these requirements. As such, we are unable to identify the Agency's interest in acting without regard to them.... In these circumstances, we conclude that the impact of the sections on the exercise of management's rights is, at most, minimal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the benefits afforded employees by sections A(2) and B of Provision 3 outweigh the minimal impact of those sections on management's right to assign work. Accordingly, we conclude that insofar as sections A(2) and B of Provision 3 require compliance with legal requirements that do not constitute applicable laws, as defined by the Authority in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the sections do not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's right to assign work and are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NWSEO Branch 9-10 and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Aircraft Operations Ctr.</span>, 61 FLRA 779, 781-82 (2006), was the proposal that unit employees not be required to fly on aircraft operated by pilots not meeting OPM qualification standards for pilots:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not contest the Agency's contention that the proposal affects various management rights. Therefore, we find that the proposal affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #1F</span>, 57 FLRA 373, 384 (2001). As the Union does not argue that the proposal constitutes a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106 (b)(2) of the Statute, we address whether the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106 (b)(3) of the Statute, as the Union claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Customs Serv.</span>, 55 FLRA at 1187. If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right(s). <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming, without deciding, that the proposal constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, we find that the proposal is not appropriate because it would excessively interfere with management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the proposal would allow employees to decide whether or not to accept work assignments on aircraft that are piloted by individuals who do not meet flight time requirements prescribed by OPM.&#x2003;Although the Union states that it is "<span class="Italic">not</span> proposing" that NOAA pilots adhere to OPM's requirements and, in fact, there is nothing in the express terms of the proposal that contains such a requirement, we find that the proposal would effectively obligate the Agency to require that NOAA pilots meet OPM's minimum flight time requirements as a precondition to requiring unit employees to perform certain tasks. In this connection, the Union concedes that the "[a]ny interference" with management rights "can be avoided" either "by requiring its pilots and co-pilots to obtain more flight time before assigning unit employees to their aircraft," or by assigning pilots who meet OPM's requirements "until the newly-minted pilots have obtained the requisite number of hours in the cockpit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has held that proposals that require adherence to certain qualifications, and preclude the assignment of work if those qualifications are not met, excessively interfere with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Professional Airways Systems Specialists</span>, 61 FLRA 97, 99 (2005) (Member Pope dissenting). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3935</span>, 59 FLRA 481, 483-84 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). As the proposal here would preclude the Agency from assigning work to employees on aircraft piloted by NOAA pilots who do not meet OPM's flight time requirements--by making such assignments optional with the employees--we find that the burden imposed on the exercise of management's rights is significant. In this regard, the proposal essentially permits employees to decide whether or not to perform certain duties--that is, whether or not to fly on aircraft piloted by certain pilots. Consequently, the Agency has no control over its ability to make those assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In weighing the benefits to employees from the proposal, we note the Union argues that there would be an increase in employee feelings <span id="page_917"></span>of personal safety from an increase in the Agency's flight experience standards for pilots. The Union cites specifically to a study, dealing with safety incidents involving all general aviation aircraft pilots (possessing private, commercial, or air transport pilot licenses), and asserts a correlation between hours of experience and safety incidents in general aviation pilots that applies to the pilots here. The Union does not, however, identify any matters of concern arising from the last few years during which pilots have operated under the reduced flight experience hours, or from the entire period of time during which the pilots have flown all of the Agency's aircraft under the established flight experience standards. Consequently, while the proposal to increase all of the Agency's flight experience standards beyond their present amounts may establish a benefit for employees, the Union has not established that the extent of that benefit is more than minimal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the cases on which the Union relies are distinguishable.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the second sentence of Proposal 12 precluded the agency from assigning employees to work in confined or enclosed spaces that lacked mechanical or natural ventilation without posting an individual nearby with equipment necessary to effect a safe rescue. The Authority found that the sentence constituted a negotiable appropriate arrangement, balancing the substantial benefits to employees against the infrequent nature of such hazardous assignments. In <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, Provision 2 prevented the agency from assigning work to employees in circumstances where they reasonably believed that the duties present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm coupled with an insufficient time within which to abate the hazard. The Authority found that the provision was a negotiable appropriate arrangement, noting that the scope of the provision was sufficiently narrow, required clear evidence to support a fear of danger and would restrict the ability to assign work "[o]nly in the most limited circumstances[.]" 29 FLRA at 733.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in contrast, the proposal is not designed to be narrowly applied, but is applicable across the full spectrum of Agency aircraft operations. And, while the Union argues the benefit from requiring more experienced pilots, the record does not establish a history of safety issues based upon the existing flight experience of the uniformed service pilots. We note the uniformed service pilots and co-pilots continue to be required to possess a commercial pilots license, must continue to satisfy certain Agency flight requirements and, according to the Agency, receive extensive training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find, on balance, that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it would excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ruled nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">Dist. No. 1, MEBA, Panama Canal Area and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 49 FLRA 461, 462-64 (1994), was Proposal 1, that "[e]xcept in an emergency, no bargaining unit member/employee will be required to stand watch alone, in the engine room, while the vessel is underway, in order to ensure the safety of the unit employee." The proposal excessively interfered with the right to assign work by tying up another employee who would accompany the employee working in the engine room:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine the duties to be assigned, to whom or to what position duties will be assigned, and when work assignments will occur. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2879 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Service, Social Security Administration, Branch Office, Hemet, California</span>, 46 FLRA 1152, 1156 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Hemet</span>). The right to assign work also includes the right to establish employees' work priorities<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Falls Church, Virginia</span>, 47 FLRA 705, 709 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 would preclude the Agency from assigning an engineer to work alone in an engine room, except in cases of emergency. By conditioning the assignment of the engineer's duties on the assignment of other work, we find that the proposal imposes a substantive condition on management's right to assign work and, therefore, directly interferes with the exercise of that right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1760 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Region II</span>, 46 FLRA 1285, 1289 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). As such, the proposal is nonnegotiable unless it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming for purposes of this decision that Proposal 1 is an arrangement, it is apparent that engineers would benefit under the proposal by having another individual available in case of accidents occurring in a tugboat's engine room. Although the record does not disclose whether engine rooms are isolated from other work areas or employees such that engineers' safety is significantly affected by the Agency's changed staffing requirements, we will assume that, at least in the case of a serious injury or accident, the benefit to engineers could be significant. In this regard, the Union submitted records showing that 15 accidents and injuries occurred in and around the engine rooms of the Agency's tugboats over a 29-month period, of which approximately 7 involved engineers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Proposal 1 also would impose substantial constraints on management's decisions concerning the assignment, timing, and completion of work in engine rooms. Clearly, under the proposal, management would be compelled to assign an additional employee to the engine room whenever an engineer is working there and the ship is underway, except in cases of emergency. Moreover, although it appears that, as the Union argues, engineers do not spend their entire watch in the engine room, that fact does not, in our view, significantly lessen the burden on management. In this regard, except in an emergency, an employee would be required to interrupt his or her own work every time an engineer entered an engine room to work, for whatever brief or lengthy period. As a result, management would be obliged to reassign or delay completing, on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis, duties left unperformed as a result. Further, unless engine work was available for the accompanying employee, that employee would not be productively employed while in the engine room.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the benefit to employees fails to outweigh the burden on the Agency's right to assign work. Accordingly, we conclude that the proposal excessively interferes with the exercise of that right and is nonnegotiable....</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals requiring management to assign specific safety functions to particular supervisors or managers are nonnegotiable infringements on the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 183-84 (1993) (Proposal 8 was nonnegotiable: "The establishment safety and health official will request that the supervisor take interim steps for the protection of the employees. The supervisor shall comply with this request"; the proposal was not advanced as an arrangement).</p>
