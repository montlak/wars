<p class="Body-Text">The regulation that defines the level of qualifications necessary for employees separated from their competitive level to exercise assignment rights to other positions is 5 CFR 351.702 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Qualifications for assignment.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 351.703, an employee is qualified for assignment under &#x00A7; 351.701 if the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Meets the OPM standards and requirements for the position, including any minimum educational requirement, and any selective placement factors established by the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is physically qualified, with reasonable accommodation where appropriate, to perform the duties of the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Meets any special qualifying condition which the OPM has approved for the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption. This determination includes recency of experience, when appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The sex of an employee may not be considered in determining whether an employee is qualified for a position, except for positions which OPM has determined certification of eligibles by sex is justified.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vigil v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 384, 388-89 (1994), summarized OPM regulatory requirements concerning the qualifications of employees exercising assignment rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be qualified for assignment to a position after release from his competitive level due to RIF, an employee must, among other things, meet the OPM standards and requirements for the position and clearly demonstrate, on the basis of overall background, a positive ability to perform successfully all critical elements of a position upon entry into the position without undue disruption to the activity and without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a). An agency may assign an employee to a vacant position without regard to OPM's standards and requirements for the position if the agency determines that the employee has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00A7; 351.703.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3080"></span><span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 16, 18-19 (1997), also explained the determinants of assignment rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for an employee to have RIF assignment rights to a position, he must be qualified for that position<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(a). An employee is qualified for assignment to an occupied position under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701 if: (1) The employee meets the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) standards and requirements for the position, including any minimum education requirements, and any selective placement factors established by the agency; (2) the employee is physically qualified, with reasonable accommodation where appropriate, to perform the duties of the position; (3) the employee meets any special qualifying condition which OPM has approved for the position; and (4) the employee clearly demonstrates on the basis of overall background, including recency of experience, a positive ability to successfully perform all critical elements of the specific position upon entry into it, without undue interruption to that activity and without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702; <span class="Italic">Manescalchi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 MSPR 479, 486-87 (1997). An agency has wide discretion in conducting a RIF; absent evidence of patent unfairness or bad faith, the Board may properly defer to an agency's determination of the requirements that an employee must satisfy to qualify for assignment to a particular position. <span class="Italic">See Hayes v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 829 F.2d 1092, 1100 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chambers v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 337, 342 (1998) ("The determination of an employee's qualification for assignment under section 351.702(a) is within the agency's discretion, subject to review by the Board under the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard."), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Holly v. DHHS</span>, 92 MSPR 601, 605 &#x00B6; 7 (2002).</p>

The matter of qualifications normally arises because the appellant did not obtain a position. But if, during a RIF, an employee was assigned to another position through RIF procedures, the employee may appeal on the basis that she lacked the qualifications for the position, and MSPB will review the applicable standards to determine the propriety of the assignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shannon v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board expressed disfavor of managers' conclusory statements concerning employees' qualifications for assignment in <span class="Italic">Treese v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 187, 194 (1998), considering claims both to a position requiring displacement and to a vacancy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Bates thus opined that the appellant lacked specific experience in warehousing and distributing large stocks of accountable paper. Although she opined conclusorily that the appellant "failed to demonstrate several KSAs associated with this position," she did not specify what the required KSAs were or even mention the fact that the position description does not list any qualification requirements in terms of KSAs. Nor did she explain why the appellant's many years of Postal supervisory experience was insufficient to demonstrate that he possessed "the capacity, adaptability, and special skills" for this warehousing job. Indeed, there is no record evidence explicitly showing that this position required any "special skills." Moreover, Ms. Bates only evaluated the appellant's assignment rights under the more stringent qualification standard of section 351.702, and not under the vacancy standard of section 351.703....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Fed. Retirement Thrift Inv. Bd.,</span> 73 MSPR 476, 496 (1997) (discounting unspecific supervisory statements discounting the appellant's ability to perform a job that he sought through assignment rights).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that, in a RIF, an employee has a substantive right to be placed in a properly drawn competitive level. <span class="Italic">See Jicha v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 73, 76 (1994). Thus, the agency bears the burden to prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant's competitive level was properly drawn. <span class="Italic">Disney v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 563, 567 (1995). To meet its burden, the agency must establish distinguishing features between positions in separate competitive levels that are sufficient as a matter of law to find that the positions are not "similar enough in duties, qualifications requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions, so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.403(a). "Without undue interruption" means without any loss to productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new, but fully qualified employee.[2] <span class="Italic">See Disney,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 567.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The RIF regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203 define "undue interruption" as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]&#x2003;degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within the allowable limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands. However, a work program would generally not be unduly interrupted even if an employee needed more than 90 days after the reduction in force to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day standard may be extended if placement is made under this part to a low priority program or to a vacant position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, when an employee's assignment rights are at issue, the burden is on the agency to prove that it properly followed the RIF regulations in effecting the appellant's assignment. <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 476, 488-89 (1999); <span class="Italic">Lewellen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 525, 526 (1985). In determining whether the agency afforded the appellant his proper assignment rights, the Board must conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review to determine whether the agency has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant did not have "the capacity, adaptability, and special skills <span id="Page_3081"></span>needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4); <span class="Italic">see Chambers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 337, 342 (1998) (the determination of an employee's qualification for assignment under section 351.702(a) is within the agency's discretion, subject to review by the Board under the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an effort to establish his qualifications for one of the encumbered Engineering Technician positions, the appellant primarily argues that these positions were reclassified with no change in duties from the WD-4701-08 Planner Estimator position that he held until a prior RIF in 2000. The position description for the Planner and Estimator position is contained in the appellant's Official Personnel File (OPF). In effect, the appellant has contended throughout this appeal that the record shows that he is qualified for the Engineering Technician position because he has successfully performed in an "essentially identical" position in the past. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A position is "essentially identical" to one previously held if the two positions would properly be placed in the same competitive level. <span class="Italic">See Pigford v. Department of the Interior</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 250, 253 (1997). Positions belong in the same competitive level if they are in the same grade and classification series and are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that the incumbent of one position could successfully perform the critical elements of the other position upon entry into it, without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Position descriptions are significant evidence in determining whether positions should be in the same competitive level, but other evidence also may be relevant under the circumstances if it sheds light on the position descriptions. <span class="Italic">See Evans v. Department of the Navy</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 492, 495-96 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has finally provided, on PFR, sufficient evidence for our determination of this issue. Specifically, Joseph J. Randazzo, the GS-1101-12 Facilities Support Contract Manager, has provided a sworn statement, in which he indicates that he was the appellant's supervisor when he performed in the WD-08 Planner and Estimator position and he is the current supervisor of the GS-09 Engineering Technicians. Mr. Randazzo states that Planner and Estimator and Engineering Technician positions are the same job, that only the title of the positions changed when they were reclassified, and that the actual duties of the positions have never changed. Mr. Randazzo further opined that, given the appellant's prior performance of the position's duties at a high level, the appellant can perform the duties of the Engineering Technician position without any additional training or any interruption in business operations. Mr. Randazzo's statement is corroborated by sworn statements provided by several current incumbents of the Engineering Technician positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After carefully reviewing the record, we also find that position descriptions for the Planner and Estimator position and the Engineering Technician position fully corroborate Mr. Randazzo's conclusions that these positions are the same job. Indeed, the later position description is a nearly verbatim restatement of the former position description. For example, the job description for the Planner and Estimator position states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The purpose of the position is to provide thorough planning and estimating for all projects performed by shop forces and contractors through small purchase contracts, and conduct control inspections</span> <span class="Italic">(AIS) on real property, facilities, and utility systems. These inspections largely determine and authorize base funding for maintenance and repairs to existing</span> construction of new buildings or large scale renovations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In comparison, the job description for the Engineering Technician position states in nearly identical terms as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The purpose of the position is to primarily provide thorough job planning and estimating for all mechanical projects performed by contractors including small purchase contracts</span> and to perform Controlled Annual Inspections (AIS) <span class="Italic">on real property, facilities, and utility systems. These inspections largely determine and authorize base funding for maintenance and repairs to existing</span> structures, facilities, and utility systems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Planner and Estimator job description states that the incumbent--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Writes detailed</span> Performance Work Statements and Government estimates for Informal, Maintenance Service and Maintenance Construction Contracts. <span class="Italic">Prepares sketches and plans as necessary to augment specifications.</span> (1) <span class="Italic">Analyzes work to be accomplished, reviews previous jobs, trade manuals, base regulations, etc., and plans work taking into account acceptable trade practices, job sequencing, and involved costs.</span> (2) <span class="Italic">Consults with the customer and other involved parties and verifies existing conditions to ensure job specifications are complete and accurate</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Planner and Estimator position description states that the incumbent--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Performs scheduled and requested inspection of all real property facilities and utility systems. Scheduled controlled inspections are performed in accordance with most recent issues of the NAVFAC MO-321/322, NAFFACINST 11010.44, and NAVFAC P-78. Prepares written reports of inspection and when required, prepares job and cost estimates for noted deficiencies.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In nearly identical language, the job description for the Engineering Technician states that the incumbent--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Performs scheduled or requested inspection of all real property facilities and utilities systems. Scheduled inspections are performed in accordance with most recent issues of the NAVFAC MO-321/322. NAFFACINST 11010.44, and NAVFAC P-78. Prepares written report of inspection and when required, prepares job and cost estimates for noted deficiencies.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without belaboring this analysis, we can discern no substantive or material differences in the stated duties or the qualifications between the Planner and Estimator and Engineering Technician position descriptions. Therefore, we find that they are essentially identical.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency has been offered several opportunities to explain why the Engineering Technician position is not essentially identical to the Planner and Estimator position, the agency continues to make conclusory statements that the appellant has failed to show that he is qualified for the engineering position. In particular, the agency contends that there is no direct correlation between wage grade and General Schedule positions and that it would not be possible or appropriate to review an employee's past position description to determine his qualifications. The agency further argues that, in his resume and other submissions, the appellant has not provided a detailed explanation of the type of work he performed as a Planner and Estimator.<span class="Italic"></span> Thus, the agency contends that it cannot find the appellant qualified for the Engineering Technician position based on the evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's arguments are without merit. As we noted above, position descriptions are significant evidence in determining an employee's knowledge, skills, and abilities, and in determining whether positions should be in the same competitive level. <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 495-96. Furthermore, the Office of Personnel Management's guidance on crediting experience specifically states that Federal employees are assumed to have gained experience by performing the duties and responsibilities described in their position descriptions, that an employee whose position is upgraded as a result of a reclassification is considered to meet the qualifications requirements of the upgraded position, and that wage grade experience may be qualifying for General Schedule positions. Office of Personnel Management Operating Manual, Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, General Policies and Instructions, &#x00A7; II, Part E.3(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant has provided unrebutted, sworn evidence and testimony that, with regard to the Engineering Technician position, he performed the "exact position" for 8 years as a WD-08 Planner and Estimator before it was "downgraded" to a GS-09 position. Therefore, we find that the agency did not establish that the appellant was unqualified for the Engineering Technician positions. Because the appellant has also shown that he is entitled to bump into several of these positions, we find that the agency did not prove that it afforded the appellant his proper <span id="Page_3082"></span>assignment rights when it demoted him to the position of a WG-10 A/C Equipment Mechanic. <span class="Italic">See Flores v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 546, 551 (1997) (where the appellant offered evidence that was contrary to the agency's wholly conclusory evidence regarding the appellant's alleged lack of qualifications for a specific position for which the appellant alleged he was qualified, the Board found that the agency failed to meet its burden of proving that it provided the appellant with the appropriate assignment rights under the RIF regulations). We therefore find that the agency is not in compliance with the Board's final order to reassess the appellant's qualifications for the Engineering Technician position and to place him in that position if he is qualified.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An individual must be physically qualified for a position in order to be placed in the position pursuant to a RIF. 5 CFR 351.702(a)(2) (2022). In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 386, 389-92 (1993), the Board undertook evaluation of conflicting medical evidence concerning the ability of the appellant to meet the physical qualifications required of a security guard position offered to the appellant after he was reached for release from his competitive level. The Board concluded that the appellant was properly separated by his agency when medical evidence demonstrated that he did not meet the physical requirements contained in the position description for that job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An issue may be whether the employee being assigned is able to perform the actual duties of the position, even though orientation in the organizational structure, terminology, and policies of the office may be required. <span class="Italic">Waksman v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 37 MSPR 640, 650-51 (1988) (relying on FPM Letter 351-20, Subch. 5-8(c)(1) (3/4/86)). <span class="Italic">Waksman</span>, involving the RIF of research engineers, described the process, involving review by panels of subject-matter specialists or experts, used by the agency to evaluate appellant's qualifications for assignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The guidance offered by the Federal Personnel Manual for application of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4), however, provides that the employee being assigned must be able to perform the "actual duties" of the position even though orientation in the organizational structure, terminology, and policies of the office might be needed. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM letter 351-20, Subchapter 5-8(c)(1), Mar. 4, 1986.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's system for determining entitlement to assignment during the reduction in force was described by an agency personnel official as follows: Employees released from their competitive levels were provided an opportunity to update their Personal Qualifications Statements, and a qualification analysis was prepared using the qualification standards in Handbook X-118. Each employee was asked to look at his qualification analysis and was provided an opportunity to recommend that additional occupations be designated for consideration. Then the determination of whether the employee could be assigned to another position was considered by a reduction-in-force "subpanel" dealing with particular job series. The subpanel considered the duties of the positions that were held by employees in a lower tenure group than the employees released from their competitive levels. It referred any unresolved questions to the reduction-in-force panel, which was composed of six managers from all areas of NBS, and which determined whether an employee was eligible for assignment to another position. The agency's process involved employees who were familiar with the specialized area and who had no personal interest in the positions considered, and it required the judgment of more than one person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It was through the process described above that the agency decided that appellant Waksman did not qualify for the four positions in question. Members from the panels testified as to the basis of their recommendation, and the appellant testified as to why he felt the judgment of the panel was in error. The administrative judge weighed the testimony of agency officials who determined that appellant Waksman could not perform the duties of any of the four positions adequately in less than 90 days against the appellant's uncorroborated testimony. Based on our review of the record, we find that the agency's decision that appellant Waksman was not qualified to fill the four positions was supported by the agency's objective process of assessing assignment rights and by the consistent and persuasive testimony of agency witnesses. The appellant's contention that he was qualified for the positions was not corroborated by expert testimony. Furthermore, we find, for the reasons cited by the administrative judge, that the appellant's testimony was less persuasive than the testimony presented by the agency. Thus, we find no basis for setting aside the administrative judge's finding that appellant Waksman had not been shown to have been entitled to reassignment to the four positions in question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After <span class="Italic">Waksman</span>, a dispute over the appellant's abilities in a scientific position will likely be resolved in favor of the employer's informed judgment unless there is expert rebuttal testimony from the appellant. The "actual duties" requirement may not be controlling, however, if the qualifications for the position sought to be assigned require only that the incumbent "be familiar" with the pertinent duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hao v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 125, 127 (1993) (the appellant was not qualified for assignment because he was not familiar with required accounting procedures).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Copprue v. USDA,</span> DA-0351-11-0305-X-1 (NP 2/23/2015), involved an enforcement recommendation directing the agency to reassess the appellant's qualifications for various positions. The Board remanded for further assessment of qualifications. Of interest was the nature of the initial decision. The underlying initial decision, <span class="Italic">Copprue v. USDA,</span> DA-0351-11-0305-I-1 (ID 3/23/2012), reversed the RIF separation because the agency did not properly provide the appellant assignment rights through regulations and union contract provisions. The AJ's initial decision reversing the RIF contained a conditional back pay order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency is ORDERED to reassess the appellant's qualifications for the positions of Program Analyst, GS-0343; Civilian Pay Technician, GS-0544; and Financial Management Assistant, GS-0503, and Accounting Technician, GS-0525, at and below the GS-07 level, utilizing the information in the appellant's OPF, her 2005 r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;, and any documents submitted in response to the agency's May 16, 2005 data call. If found qualified for one of those positions, the agency is ORDERED to cancel the appellant's demotion and to place her in one of those positions or a position of like grade, pay, tenure, and commuting area. This action must be accomplished no later than 20 calendar days after the date this initial decision becomes final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant is placed into one of the identified or like positions, I ORDER the agency to pay appellant by check or through electronic funds transfer for the appropriate amount of back pay, with interest and to adjust benefits with appropriate credits and deductions in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management's regulations no later than 60 calendar days after the date this initial decision becomes final. I ORDER the appellant to cooperate in good faith with the agency's efforts to compute the amount of back pay and benefits due and to provide all necessary information requested by the agency to help it comply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Curiously, the AJ did not reverse the RIF with a back pay order restoring the appellant to her position until the agency properly determined assignment rights.</p>
