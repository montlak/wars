<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-46"><span class="space">3.</span> Retirement Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Retirement appeals occasionally result in dismissals without adjudication of the merits of the case because of the reconsideration process that appellants are often expected to follow before they appeal to the Board from an adverse decision by OPM on a claimed retirement benefit or determination. OPM usually adjudicates a retirement claim through what it calls "initial decision." At the time the claim is initially decided by OPM, the claimant is given instructions explaining how to obtain reconsideration by OPM of its initial decision on the benefit claim. Once OPM issues a reconsideration decision, the OPM determination is "final" and subject to MSPB appeal. OPM may also issue "final" decisions, appealable to the Board without the requirement of a reconsideration decision. In cases requiring the reconsideration process, if the claimant appeals to the Board before obtaining an OPM reconsideration decision, the AJ will likely dismiss the appeal as premature on the theory that there is no final OPM decision that supports a Board appeal. The Federal Circuit reviewed the practice, characterizing as confusion the instructions from OPM to the appellant, but affirmed a Board decision dismissing "without prejudice" an appeal on a retirement issue that was not been resolved through an OPM reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Toquero v. MSPB</span>, 982 F.2d 520, 524 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("[T]he instructions Mr. Toquero received from OPM were confusing at best regarding whether it was necessary to request a reconsideration. No one--not OPM, not the AJ--ever explained or clarified, prior to the dismissal of the appeal by the MSPB, what he must do to have his case considered on the merits."). If during the pendency of a PFR the Board learns that OPM has issued a final or reconsideration decision, the Board may remand the case back to the AJ for adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rumph v. OPM</span>, 107 MSPR 592, 2008 MSPB 3 (2008) [Refer to earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-020.html#sec2-21">Negative OPM Reconsideration Decision Appeal</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-09-046.html#sec2-45">Premature Appeal that Ripens into Appealable Action During Regional Adjudication or During PFR</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because the Board allows its jurisdiction over retirement cases to be based on only what it characterizes as a "final" OPM decision, scores of appeals are initiated from OPM reconsideration decisions, and scores of appeals are then dismissed as beyond the Board's jurisdiction. when OPM withdraws the reconsideration decision with a promise to issue another reconsideration decision on some unspecified future date. The subsections of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> referred to at the beginning and end of the this subsection should be consulted for a more complete picture of how the Board addresses, or does not properly address, the OPM reconsideration process and the delays that ensue from the practice of permitting Board jurisdiction to depend on manipulation of the finality of an OPM decision affecting an annuity interest. Given the Board's insistence on due process in other types of actions, it is an administrative embarrassment that the Board fails to impose clear deadlines on OPM to reissue a reconsideration decision after an appeal is filed from a reconsideration decision that OPM then withdraws. Editorial comment aside, the Board's approach to OPM reconsideration orders withdrawn following an appeal is summarized by <span class="Italic">Okello v. OPM</span>, 120 MSPR 498, 502-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16, 2014 MSPB 2 (2014), involving six years of jurisdictional interplay over an annuity overpayment and OPM 's collections efforts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction to adjudicate FERS appeals derives from statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or the United States under [FERS] administered by [OPM] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of OPM decisions under FERS, the Board has recognized three situations in which OPM is deemed to have issued an appealable decision. <span class="Italic">See Ghannam v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 527 F. App'x 862, 864-65 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (nonprecedential). Two of those situations are prescribed by OPM's regulations: OPM may either (1) issue a reconsideration decision under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.306 or (2) issue an initial decision without reconsideration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.307. Either type of decision is final and appealable to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.308.[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.306(e), .307. The third situation derives from Board case law. Specifically, the Board will take jurisdiction over an appeal concerning a retirement matter in which OPM has refused or improperly failed to issue a final decision. <span class="Italic">E.g., McNeese v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 70, 74, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). In other words, even an initial decision subject to reconsideration or the absence of any decision at all may, under appropriate circumstances, constitute a final "administrative action or decision" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;By contrast, an OPM initial decision subject to reconsideration is not a final decision appealable to the Board under OPM's regulations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.305(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board has sometimes treated "final decision" and "reconsideration decision" synonymously. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Adkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 5 (2006) ("[T]he Board ordinarily lacks jurisdiction to consider an issue not addressed by OPM in a reconsideration decision."); <span class="Italic">Turner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 55, 60-61 (1993) ("It is well settled that the Board has jurisdiction over a retirement appeal only where OPM has issued a reconsideration decision."). As explained above, the Board has jurisdiction over an OPM "final decision" regardless of whether it was issued in the form of a "reconsideration decision." The relevant inquiry is whether OPM has issued a "final decision" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.308--not whether it has issued a "reconsideration decision" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it is undisputed that OPM has not issued a final decision under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.308. Nevertheless, we find that, under the totality of the circumstances, OPM's failure to act on this matter constitutes an appealable administrative action affecting the appellant's rights under FERS and that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1). In reaching our decision, we have considered that this matter has been going on for a very long time--more than 6 years since OPM first determined that Mr. Okello had received an annuity overpayment. <span class="Italic">See Easter v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 568, &#x00B6; 9 (2006) (it appeared from an 18-month delay in addressing the appellant's disability retirement application that OPM had simply declined to adjudicate it). We have also considered that Mr. Okello diligently sought a final decision from OPM throughout that period, but to no avail. <span class="Italic">See Ramirez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). We have considered OPM's representation that it still intends to issue a further decision in this matter. This would normally weigh significantly against the Board taking jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Rorick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 597, &#x00B6; 5 (2008). However, in light of the facts described above, especially OPM's promise well over a year ago to issue a new decision "shortly,"[4] we have little confidence that OPM will follow through with its stated intention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;According to the administrative judge, it appears to be OPM's custom not to issue decisions in retirement cases that are in active litigation before the Board. Although this may be true, and although it may be a sensible policy in general, we find that it is not an adequate justification for the delays in this case. Specifically, OPM has instigated much of the litigation in this matter, including the instant appeal, by issuing and then rescinding decisions, erroneously notifying Mr. Okello that an informational letter was a "final decision," and notifying Mr. Okello of actions against his annuity without informing him of reconsideration rights. Litigation resulting from OPM's own administrative missteps is not a sufficient reason for it to avoid issuing a final decision for more than 6 years. Moreover, OPM's policy of suspending administrative processing during active litigation does not explain why it did not issue a final decision during the 19-month period from July 2010 to February 2012, during which there was no litigation, especially since it had promised to issue such a decision "promptly."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM is the agency with primary statutory authority to adjudicate FERS annuity cases and to issue related regulations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(b), (c), (g). We will not lightly assume jurisdiction over a FERS annuity appeal outside the explicit language of those regulations. Nevertheless, the Board has statutory mandates of its own, including the mandate to adjudicate appeals of OPM actions or decisions affecting FERS annuitants, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(1), 8461(e)(1), and the mandate to expedite the proceedings before it, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(i)(4); <span class="Italic">see Phillips v. Veterans Administration</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 409, 412 (1984). Moreover, Mr. Okello had a right to have this case adjudicated under the law, and a dismissal at this stage could effectively prevent an appellant from obtaining adjudication of his claim. <span class="Italic">See McLaughlin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 536, 546-47 <span id="Page_920"></span>(1994),<span class="Italic"> aff'd</span>, 47 F.3d 1181 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Under the unusual and compelling circumstances of this case, we find that OPM has effectively abdicated its role of adjudicating this claim. OPM's inaction is tantamount to an administrative action or order affecting the appellant's rights under FERS, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), and, therefore, this matter is properly before the Board.</p>

The appellant may have repeatedly contacted OPM to request answers to his questions, but the Board has found that it lacks jurisdiction based on OPM's failure to issue a final decision for much longer delays than exist in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hasanadka v.

OPM</span>, 113 MSPR 118, 120-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-14, 2010 MSPB 12 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 7, 2003, the appellant separated from his position as Clerk with the U.S. Postal Service and thereafter began receiving a disability annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). By letter dated March 13, 2009, OPM informed the appellant that a computer match had revealed a discrepancy between the earned income he reported to OPM for calendar year 2007 and the income figure reported by the Social Security Administration (SSA). In particular, OPM found that the appellant's earned income for 2007, as reported by the SSA, exceeded the earnings limitation for his continued entitlement to disability retirement benefits, i.e., 80 percent of the current rate of pay for the position he occupied immediately before his retirement. The letter informed the appellant that if the amount reported by SSA was accurate, he would be ineligible to receive those benefits after June 30, 2008, and that any benefits paid after that date would constitute an overpayment. OPM invited the appellant to dispute the SSA figure by submitting documentation of his 2007 earnings and any other documentation he deemed relevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 8, 2009, the appellant submitted a response in which he disputed OPM's determination, claiming that he was not notified of the 80 percent earnings limitation and that OPM improperly excluded a locality pay increase from its calculation of his rate of pay immediately before retirement. The appellant also requested that OPM waive any overpayment resulting from its determination that he had exceeded his earnings limitation, and that OPM change his "disability retirement...to a regular discontinued service retirement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated April 24, 2009, OPM informed the appellant that, after reviewing the information in his submission, it had determined that he had been restored to earning capacity. It also notified him that his disability benefits would be terminated effective June 30, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter to OPM dated May 6, 2009, the appellant requested "information regarding [his] appeal rights," stating that OPM's April 24 letter failed to provide him with such information and that it also "did not address [his] request for waiver of any overpayment or [his] request to transfer to a regular retirement. The record below contains no response from OPM to the appellant's May 6 letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed the instant appeal on June 6, 2009. In it, he stated that he was "appealing OPM's determination that [he] was overpaid and the denial of a waiver of the overpayment," he claimed that OPM had failed to respond to his request for a waiver or advise him of his appeal rights, and he requested as relief that the Board grant him "a waiver of any overpayment and that [he] be changed to regular retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate an individual's rights and interests under the Civil Service Retirement System only after OPM has rendered a reconsideration decision on the issue in question. <span class="Italic">Luna v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 465, &#x00B6; 8 (2001). Nevertheless, the Board may take jurisdiction over a retirement appeal in the absence of an OPM reconsideration decision where the appellant has made repeated requests for such a decision and the evidence indicates that OPM does not intend to issue a reconsideration decision. Because, as discussed below, OPM in effect has issued an appealable final decision concerning the termination of the appellant's retirement annuity and his request to convert that annuity to a discontinued service annuity, we find that the administrative judge erred in determining that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the instant appeal as it relates to that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its April 24 letter, OPM informed the appellant, as we have noted above, of its decision to terminate the appellant's disability retirement annuity retroactively. It also enclosed a form that provided information about the circumstances under which a disability retirement annuity could be reinstated, and that included detailed instructions for applying for reinstatement. Those instructions included a statement that the applicant was required to "wait until after January 1st of the year following the year in which [his] earnings fall below the 80 percent limitation." Nothing in the April 24 letter or the enclosed form includes any information about procedures for requesting review of the decision to terminate the appellant's annuity retroactively. OPM did not address or even mention the appellant's claims that it had improperly calculated the current rate of pay for the position from which he retired, and that it had otherwise improperly terminated his disability benefits. Further, it did not address or mention the appellant's argument that, if his disability benefits could not be continued, his annuity should be continued under provisions authorizing discontinued service annuities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find no support for the administrative judge's finding, that OPM had stated that it "intends to issue a reconsideration decision" at some future time, and no other indication in the record that OPM intends to issue any further decision on the appellant's entitlement to an annuity continuing after June 30, 2008. The letter of April 24 gave no indication that any further action would be taken unless and until the appellant requested reinstatement of his annuity based on circumstances arising after the termination of that annuity, and it gave no indication that it had considered or would consider the appellant's argument that his annuity should be continued under provisions other than those authorizing disability annuities. OPM also has not responded, as we have previously indicated, to the appellant's correspondence following its April 24 letter. Moreover, in its only substantive submission below, it denied having issued either an initial decision or a final decision. OPM stated that its letter preceding the April 24 letter, i.e., its letter of March 13, "informed [the appellant] on how to dispute [its] finding that his earnings exceeded the 80% limit, and it made no mention of the subsequent letter of April 24, terminating the appellant's annuity. Finally, OPM's response to the appellant's petition for review includes no reference to any intention to take further action in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under similar circumstances, the Board has held that an OPM letter notifying an annuitant that his annuity payments were being suspended was tantamount to an appealable reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See Luna</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 465, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">cf. Scallion v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 457, 461 (1996) (where a letter from OPM informed the retiree that he was entitled to no further refund of his annuity-related deposit, but the letter did not advise him of his right to request reconsideration, and where there was no indication that OPM intended to issue any further decision, OPM's letter was tantamount to an appealable reconsideration decision); <span class="Italic">Dopadre v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 346, 351 (1996) (letter in which OPM found that an appellant was not entitled to a survivor annuity under her divorce decree constituted OPM's final decision, since OPM apparently did not intend to issue a reconsideration decision). Accordingly, we find that the April 24 letter is tantamount to an appealable reconsideration decision that affects the appellant's rights or interests under the CSRS, and that the Board therefore has jurisdiction to adjudicate his appeal of OPM's decision to terminate his annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to any alleged overpayment related to OPM's determination that he was no longer eligible for disability retirement benefits, however, the administrative judge correctly determined that OPM had yet to make any finding that the appellant had received an overpayment. Further, OPM did not address the appellant's request for a waiver of recovery of this overpayment. "A corollary to [the] rule [that a reconsideration decision is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a Board appeal involving federal retirement benefits] is that the scope of an appeal involving federal retirement benefits is limited to those matters addressed in OPM's reconsideration decision." <span class="Italic">Dragonette v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 384, 386 (1996). Because OPM has yet to issue an appealable reconsideration decision addressing these questions, the Board is without jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claims concerning them. If OPM issues a decision determining that the appellant has received an overpayment, the appellant will have an opportunity to request reconsideration and, if necessary, file a Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Green v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-2264.Opinion.4-4-2019.pdf">766 Fed. Appx. 995, 998-99</a> (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the Board determined it had jurisdiction despite the lack of a reconsideration decision because OPM never answered appellant's letter requesting information regarding his appeal rights and OPM never indicated, either before or during the appeal to the Board, that it planned to take further action in the appellant's case. 113 M.S.P.R. at 123. The Board noted that they had previously exercised jurisdiction under similar circumstances where OPM effectively circumscribed an annuitant's appeal rights by failing to adjudicate his claim to a final, appealable decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_921"></span>Here, Ms. Green never sent a letter to which OPM failed to respond. As the Board noted, OPM also never indicated that it did not intend to take further action. Indeed, OPM sent a letter to Ms. Green on April 17, 2018, six days after she filed her appeal with the Board, notifying her of the right to request reconsideration of the decision to terminate her disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Ms. Green cannot purport to suffer any harm as a result of OPM's or the Board's actions. After receiving OPM's April 17th letter, Ms. Green exercised her right to reconsideration as outlined in that letter. On August 16, 2018, OPM issued its final decision which noted Ms. Green's right to appeal the decision to the Board within thirty days of the letter date. Ms. Green's appeal from OPM's August 16th decision is currently pending before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Green v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., No. CH-0845-18-0576-I-1. The precise remedy she seeks before this Court--the right to appeal OPM's termination of her annuity benefits to the Board--is one she already received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Ms. Green's Amended Memorandum in Lieu Of Oral Argument, she contends that she was "forced to respond" to the April 17th letter, and did so only to "preserve her Due Process Rights." She argues that the April 17th letter afforded her an option to request reconsideration of the $12,664.22 she owed to OPM for total gross annuity over-payments. She does not believe it afforded her the right to request reconsideration of the decision to terminate her disability retirement benefits. She believes, therefore, that despite the April 17th letter, OPM's March 12th letter still constituted a final decision to terminate her disability retirement benefits from which she could appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Green's characterization of the April 17th letter is inaccurate. The letter specifically mentions OPM's decision to terminate Ms. Green's disability retirement benefits. The additional discussion regarding annuity overpayments is based on the fact that she is no longer entitled to receive disability retirement benefits under FERS. The document attached to the April 17th letter, which explains Ms. Green's right to request reconsideration of OPM's decision, further states that she is entitled to re-quest reconsideration if she "object[s] to OPM's decision to hold [her] responsible for the repayment of the debt." Of course, inherent in an objection to OPM's decision to hold her responsible for repayment of the debt is the decision to find her ineligible to receive the annuity payments in the first place. It was therefore the April 17th letter that afforded her the right to request reconsideration of OPM's decision to terminate her FERS benefits. The March 12th letter had no effect on her right to appeal to the Board.</p>
