<p class="Body-Text">Corrective action case processing is authorized by 5 USC 1214:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Investigation of prohibited personnel practices; corrective action</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1)(A)&#x2003;The Special Counsel shall receive any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice and shall investigate the allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; Within 15 days after the date of receiving an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel shall provide written notice to the person who made the allegation that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; the allegation has been received by the Special Counsel; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; shall include the name of a person at the Office of Special Counsel who shall serve as a contact with the person making the allegation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; Unless an investigation is terminated under paragraph (2), the Special Counsel shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; within 90 days after notice is provided under subparagraph (B), notify the person who made the allegation of the status of the investigation and any action taken by the Office of the Special Counsel since the filing of the allegation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii) notify such person of the status of the investigation and any action taken by the Office of the Special Counsel since the last notice, at least every 60 days after notice is given under clause (i); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii)&#x2003; notify such person of the status of the investigation and any action taken by the Special Counsel at such time as determined appropriate by the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; No later than 10 days before the Special Counsel terminates any investigation of a prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel shall provide a written status report to the person who made the allegation of the proposed findings of fact and legal conclusions. The person may submit written comments about the report to the Special Counsel. The Special Counsel shall not be <span id="Page_3926"></span>required to provide a subsequent written status report under this subparagraph after the submission of such written comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003;If the Special Counsel terminates any investigation under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel shall prepare and transmit to any person on whose allegation the investigation was initiated a written statement notifying the person of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; the termination of the investigation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; a summary of relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, including the facts that support, and the facts that do not support, the allegations of such person;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii)&#x2003; the reasons for terminating the investigation; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iv)&#x2003; a response to any comments submitted under paragraph (1)(D).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; A written statement under subparagraph (A) may not be admissible as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding, without the consent of the person who received such statement under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Except in a case in which an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board under any law, rule, or regulation, any such employee, former employee, or applicant shall seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board. An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may seek corrective action from the Board under section 1221, if such employee, former employee, or applicant seeks corrective action for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9) (A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) from the Special Counsel and--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)(i) the Special Counsel notifies such employee, former employee, or applicant that an investigation concerning such employee, former employee, or applicant has been terminated; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; no more than 60 days have elapsed since notification was provided to such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment that such investigation was terminated; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; 120 days after seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel, such employee, former employee, or applicant has not been notified by the Special Counsel that the Special Counsel shall seek corrective action on behalf of such employee, former employee, or applicant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;If an employee, former employee, or applicant seeks a corrective action from the Board under section 1221, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (3)(B), the Special Counsel may continue to seek corrective action personal to such employee, former employee, or applicant only with the consent of such employee, former employee, or applicant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;In addition to any authority granted under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel may, in the absence of an allegation, conduct an investigation for the purpose of determining whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice (or a pattern of prohibited personnel practices) has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003; A determination by the Special Counsel under this paragraph shall not be cited or referred to in any proceeding under this paragraph or any other administrative or judicial proceeding for any purpose, without the consent of the person submitting the allegation of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)(A)&#x2003;The Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate, if the Board determines that the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a prohibited personnel practice, other than one described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9) (A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>

The Special Counsel shall require, within 30 days after the receipt of the report by the agency, a certification by the head of the agency which states--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;The Special Counsel may petition the Board to order corrective action, including fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred by an employee due to an investigation of the employee by an agency, if the investigation by an agency was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for a disclosure or protected activity described in section 2302(b)(8) or subparagraph (A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) of section 2302(b)(9), without regard to whether a personnel action, as defined in section 2302(a)(2)(A), is taken.</p>
