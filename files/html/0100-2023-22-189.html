<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-187"><span class="space">c.</span> Late Motion</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee motions must be filed on time. One can request an extension of time, and possibly litigate the denial of the extension--or one can get the petition filed on time. The latter is the best route. Timely file; amend later. The appellant is expected to be familiar with Board regulations governing the timing of fee petitions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Frish v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 208, 209 n.* (1985). A late petition for counsel fees will be adjudicated under the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> criteria governing acceptance of late petitions for appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steele v. MSPB</span>, 546 Fed. Appx. 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) (applying <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> to a late fee petition; the Board was not required to articulate each <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> factor); <span class="Italic">Trauner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 512, 514 (1982) (lateness of a supplemental fee petition was not excused because of a delay in the receipt of communications from the AJ; the attorney failed to directly notify the AJ of his change of address). An appellant (or his counsel) should be placed on notice of a timeliness issue either by the AJ's order responding to receipt of the fee motion or by an agency motion to dismiss the fee motion. Notice of the deficiency should address the specific evidence required to correct the defect. Without that notice, the Board is inclined to accept information addressing the timeliness issue for the first time with the appellant's PFR challenging the disposition of the addendum initial decision rejecting a fee application. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. VA</span>, 74 MSPR 472, 474-75 (1997). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 13 MSPR 80, 82 (1982) (declining to excuse a late fee petition despite the somewhat confusing information on the filing period provided by the Board secretary: "[c]ounsel has an 'affirmative duty as a member of the bar to be cognizant of all provisions of law affecting his client's rights.'").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee petitions are, in current practice, filed by e-filing--for those who are e-filers. For others, counsel whose fee petition appears to be late must demonstrate timeliness through the postmark, or presumptions in lieu of a postmark, or provide a sworn statement concerning the manner of mailing. In <span class="Italic">Adamov v. Marine Corps</span>, 41 MSPR 275, 279 (1989), the a certificate of service was insufficient to explain the circumstances of filing of what appeared to be a late fee petition. The Board implied that it expected a sworn statement from counsel both identifying who mailed the petition and explaining the office procedure for mailings, i.e., the steps taken to assure timely mailing. The use of the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> rule concerning late fee requests was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Pfaehler v. MSPB</span>, 783 F.2d 187 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In 1994, the court injected back into the timeliness equation the length of the delay; previously the Board found any otherwise unexcused delay was inexcusable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Counsel who are electronic filers risk dismissal of late fee petitions if they fail to timely notify the Board of changes in email addresses and lose track of Board issuances, including decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. USDA</span>, PH-0752-09-0473-A-1 (NP 9/16/2013) (appellant was also an e-filer and did not dispute that she received the Board's Opinion and Order when it was issued).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mynard v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MYNARD_DON_A_DA_0831_06_0436_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_313430.pdf">108 MSPR 58</a>, 63 &#x00B6; 7, 2008 MSPB 23 (2008), summarized the Board's approach to late fee petitions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the notice the AJ provided to the appellant in the initial decision addressing the merits of his appeal, the Board's regulations provide that a motion for attorney fees must be filed no later than 60 days after the date on which a decision becomes final. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(d).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has held that, in a related situation, the time period for filing with the Board does not begin to toll until <span class="Italic">actual receipt</span> of the document that puts the appellant on notice of his appeal right. The date of that document is immaterial since it is the act of receiving the document that starts the filing period. <span class="Italic">Loui v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 25 F.3d 1011 (Fed. Cir. 1994)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Mr. Pfeiffer's motion was only three days late. Our superior court has held that we must consider the minimal nature of the delay when making a good cause determination. <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4722"></span>In similar cases involving attorney fees, the Board has found good cause for the delay, exercising our discretion to waive the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Farrell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 564 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the specific facts here, I would consider also that the nature of an attorney fee motion is inherently different from an initial appeal of an adverse action. In an adverse action appeal, there are solid policy reasons for applying a filing time limit. The parties are engaged in an adversarial situation, the factual claims on both sides become more difficult to establish as time goes by, and the back pay and damages liabilities continue to escalate if the proceedings are drawn out unnecessarily. Justice is best served by the expeditious filing of the necessary documents in these cases, and relatively strict application of time limits is an important aspect of expeditious filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These same policy considerations, however, are not found in a motion for attorney fees case such as this. Rarely are witness memories and contested factual submissions necessary to the adjudication of a fee claim. There is no ever-mounting agency liability for back pay or damages. As a practical matter, it matters little to either party whether an attorney fee claim is submitted a few days late. In fact it is the appellant, not the agency, that is harmed by his own delayed filing. A delay in filing results in a delay in any fees that are awarded, and few attorneys prefer to have their fee award postponed any more than necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most importantly, though, is the fact that it is good policy for the Board to encourage attorneys to represent appellants before us to ensure that the appellants' rights are protected and that justice is done. The majority opinion's hypertechnical application of the time limit involved frustrates that public policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is a broad consensus that experienced legal counsel is of great benefit to an appellant that would otherwise appear before us <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. When considering a motion for a fee award, the Board has long held that we must consider the broad remedial purposes of the Civil Service Reform Act, and that the attorney fee provision of that statute "was clearly intended to remove the cost of legal representation as a burden or barrier to relief from unfounded agency actions in appropriate cases. Moreover, in a broader sense, the award of attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), by assuring payment for the cost of vindicating employee rights when the interest of justice so warrants, furthers the statutory mandate that federal agencies adhere to the merit system principles set forth in the Reform Act [footnote omitted]." <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Interior,</span> 2 MSPB 604, 2 MSPR 445, 453 (1980), <span class="Italic">overruled on other</span> <span class="Italic">grounds by Koch v. Department of Commerce,</span> 19 MSPR 219 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dismissal of this attorney fee motion because it is three days late, where sufficient grounds exist to find good cause to excuse this brief delay, severely undermines the broad remedial purpose of the Civil Service Reform Act, and creates a burden for this vindicated appellant who was the subject of an unwarranted agency action. As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 183-84 (1980), a good cause determination, excusing a late filing, "is an elastic concept [which] entitles the employee to the application of the broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience." Such a determination is warranted under the instant facts. I would excuse this late filing and remand the motion to the administrative judge for a fee determination on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit did not adopt the Chairman's dissent. It affirmed the majority decision, <span class="Italic">Pfeiffer v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3094):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pfeiffer first argues that the filing period did not begin until his attorney received the notice of the Board's July 1 decision on July 10. Invoking the teachings of <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> v. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), Pfeiffer asks that this court find that fundamental fairness concerns mandate that the filing period be equitably tolled until the date he or his attorney received notice of the decision. The equitable concerns of <span class="Italic">Irwin</span>, however, are plainly embedded in the Board's own regulations, as filing dates may be waived by the Board for good cause shown, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.12. Thus, Pfeiffer's challenge cannot be that the Board's timing scheme fails to recognize principles of equity: it does. Instead, Pfeiffer's complaint is that these equitable principles did not apply to him in this case, a question we address below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pfeiffer's citation of <span class="Italic">Loui v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 25 F.3d 1011, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 1994), for the proposition that the filing period begins only upon receipt of notice, is similarly inapposite. In <span class="Italic">Loui</span>, we were presented with the interpretation of a regulation that triggered the filing period on the "effective date" of a removal action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1013. We concluded that the "effective date" could not be earlier than the date the removal notice was delivered, because a companion regulation required such notice to be delivered by the "effective date." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the timing period begins, according to the relevant regulation, on "the date [the Board's] decision becomes final." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.203(d). But Pfeiffer cannot claim that there was any real question about when the Board's decision became final. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pfeiffer I</span>. 75 MSPR at 294 ("This is the Board's final order in this appeal. The initial decision in this appeal is now final.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pfeiffer also argues that the Board did not fulfill its notice obligation to apprise him of the filing deadline. He suggests that there is uncertainty and confusion surrounding the filing deadlines enforced by the Board, and that the notice he received thus did not fairly apprise him of the filing deadline. We reject, however, the contention that the notice here, which Pfeiffer admits stated that the filing period was "WITHIN 60 CALENDAR DAYS OF THE DATE OF THIS DECISION," <span class="Italic">id</span>. (caps in original), was anything but crystal clear. Unlike the notice at issue in <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Bd.</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1994), which merely stated that the claimant had "20 days" to file, this notice clearly indicated the use of calendar (as opposed to business) days and that the filing period ran from the date of the decision. The Board did not fail to adequately apprise Pfeiffer of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Pfeiffer argues that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to grant him an extension for good cause. Pfeiffer explains that his attorney was busy preparing for other matters before the Board, traveling on business to Korea, Japan and Minneapolis, and suffering from fatigue and jet lag during the filing period. The Board declined to find good cause for a late filing based solely on the workload or schedule of Pfeiffer's attorney, and found nothing in the record that indicated that Pfeiffer or his attorney had made any reasonable efforts to file the motion for fees in a timely manner<span class="Italic">. See Pfeiffer 11</span>, slip op. at 7-8. We concur with the Board's analysis, and thus find no abuse of discretion in the refusal to waive the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delay is not justified because counsel waits for the AJ to send information on requirements for fee petitions. The Board's regulations do not require or contemplate that AJs will act as legal advisors to attorneys who appear before them. <span class="Italic">Broadaway v. OPM</span>, 9 MSPR 650, 651, 9 MSPB 268 (1982). No good cause for an untimely fee petition was found for an appellant who apparently was not misinformed by agency personnel as to filing requirements and who failed to consult with his own counsel concerning the processing of the fee petition. <span class="Italic">Solene v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 28, 29 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement discussions with agency counsel over counsel fees do not justify a late fee petition. <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 40 MSPR 604, 608 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Earel v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 165, 168-69 (1991) (settlement agreement submitted after the initial decision became final did not extend the time for filing a fee petition). <span class="Italic">Castellanos v. DOJ,</span> NY-0752-09-0107-A-1 (NP 9/16/2011), declined to excuse a late fee petition based on the argument that the appellant expected fee entitlement to be resolved through settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant prevailed in his appeal alleging that the agency had constructively removed him. In the initial decision on the merits, the administrative judge informed the parties that the decision would become final on September 17, 2009, unless a petition for review was filed by that date. The administrative judge also informed the appellant that, if no petition for review was filed, he could request payment of attorney fees by filing a motion no later than 60 calendar days after the date that the initial decision became final. Neither party filed a petition for review. On November 12, 2010, the appellant filed a motion for attorney fees. The administrative judge found that the deadline for filing a motion for attorney fees for work on the constructive removal appeal was November 16, 2009, and that the appellant failed to show good cause for his delay of 361 days in filing. She dismissed the motion as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant states, as he did below, that he expected that fees would be resolved as part of a global settlement or on arriving at the amount of back pay. However, the date that the parties arrived at the amount of back pay due the appellant is irrelevant to the question of whether the appellant acted diligently and prudently with respect to his request for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Ballentine v. Department of Justice</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 28, 29 (1987) ("Further the date on which the agency fully complies with the Board order is irrelevant to a determination of whether a motion for an award of attorney fees was timely filed."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 845 F.2d 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table); <span class="Italic">Naviello v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 396, 397 (1983) (the fact that the Office of Personnel Management did not serve the appellant with proof of compliance on or before the date the initial decision became final did not affect the finality of the Board's decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge improperly relied on <span class="Italic">Solis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 584, 586 (1982), to find that he had untimely filed his motion for fees. The administrative judge relied on the finding in <span class="Italic">Solis</span> that any delay by the agency in complying with the Board's decision did not affect the finality of the Board's decision and that any delay in the agency's computation of an award due the appellant did not excuse the appellant's failure to file his motion for fees. The appellant asserts that his case differs from <span class="Italic">Solis</span> because, in <span class="Italic">Solis</span>, the Board noted that the appellant had not argued that he was unaware of the time limit for filing a fee motion and he asserts that he in fact argued that he was unaware of the time limit for filing a fee petition. However, even if the appellant's counsel stated that he was unaware of the time limit for filing a motion for fees, his assertion would not change the outcome of this appeal. The Board has consistently found that attorneys <span id="Page_4723"></span>have an affirmative obligation to familiarize themselves with the Board's regulations and to be cognizant of all provisions of law affecting their clients' rights, and neither an appellant's failure to read the material provided him nor counsel's failure to carefully read the initial decision establishes good cause for the delay in filing a motion for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Ballentine</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 30; <span class="Italic">Naviello</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. at 397; <span class="Italic">Small v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 366, 367-68 (1981). The administrative judge therefore properly determined that the appellant failed to establish good cause for the delay in filing his motion for attorney fees regarding the merits phase of his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980) (to establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board excused a delay of a week because the attorney received the Board's decision only a day before the fee motion was to be filed. The attorney acted reasonably promptly under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Hennelly v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 26 MSPR 595, 596-97 (1985). A fee petition, late by a week, was excused because of counsel's absence from his office a result of a personal emergency. <span class="Italic">Ceja v. DLA</span>, 34 MSPR 399, 403 (1987). But an appellant's opposition to an agency PFR of an addendum fee decision was rejected as untimely when the appellant complained that he did not know the status of the case. He made no inquiry about the case for a year after the initial fee decision was issued. There must be a measure of due diligence in following the progress of a case even if essential documents do not reach counsel. <span class="Italic">Poole v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 384, 385 (1984). If there is a delay between the issuance of the Board's final decision on a PFR and receipt of the decision by the appellant's counsel, and if there will be no prejudice to the agency and only a few days of delay are involved, the AJ should extend the period for filing a fee petition if the attorney expeditiously requests an extension and files the fee petition before the motion is ruled upon and denied by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Farrell v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 564, 566 (1996) (although the initial decision was apparently received by the appellant, the failure of his attorney to receive the initial decision excused a fee petition that was late but had been filed immediately upon the attorney's determination that the initial decision was issued); <span class="Italic">Trachy v. Defense Communications Agency</span>, 20 MSPR 104, 105-06 (1984) (applying <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> timeliness factors).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An attorney's late fee petition was excused because of difficulties encountered in reconstructing records, <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 411, 413 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulatory provisions do not include a requirement that counsel request an extension of time to file a motion for fees when he can foresee that the motion will not be timely filed. Although it would be reasonable and diligent for counsel to do so, the failure to request an extension does not necessarily demonstrate lack of reasonableness or diligence. Thus, the administrative judge erred in placing such a duty on counsel. Counsel's reasons for his delay in filing should have been considered under the standard of diligence and ordinary prudence under all of the relevant circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, counsel explained that preparation of the motion for fees was difficult and took an unusually long time because his time records were lost when the firm's records were moved to a new storage facility, and his billing sheets were destroyed by fire, making them unavailable for review and submission when the attorney fee motion had to be filed. Reconstruction was necessary....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has established good cause for his untimely filing. The circumstances that caused the delay were beyond his control....&#8197;Further, there is no showing that the agency was prejudiced by the delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Problems may develop when there are multiple attorneys on an appeal, particularly when one attorney has succeeded another and the attorney who first represented a client files a fee petition after learning of the appellant's success following the change in representation. In one convoluted situation, involving not only multiple lawyers but multiple appeals and settlements, the Board excused a fee petition from a predecessor attorney that was arguably slightly late, <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 51, 57-58 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A request for payment of attorney fees must be made by motion, filed with the administrative judge within 30 days of the date on which an initial decision becomes final under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.113. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.37 (1996).[2] In <span class="Italic">Olson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 62 MSPR 261, 264, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 39 F.3d 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), a case with facts similar to those in this appeal, a first initial decision dismissed a petition for appeal without prejudice pursuant to the parties' settlement agreement and a later initial decision resolved the issues of the appeal. The Board found that the time limit for filing a motion for fees began to run from the date that the earlier initial decision became final. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, here, to be timely, the appellant's fee motion should have been filed within 30 days of the date on which the first initial decision, that of September 29, 1995, became final, or by December 3, 1995. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's fee motion, filed on July 5, 1996, therefore is untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Currently, the Board's regulations provide that a motion for attorney fees must be filed no later than 60 days after the date on which a decision becomes final<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.203(d) (1998). At the time of this appeal, however, the Board's regulations provided that a motion for fees must be filed no later than 30 days after the date on which a decision becomes final. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.37 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his motion for fees, Gebhardt stated that he filed three fee motions with the regional office before the one that he filed on July 5, 1996. Gebhardt stated that each of these motions was returned as filed "too early." Two of the attachments to the July 5, 1996, fee motion were signed on different dates long before July 5, 1996, and would thus tend to support Gebhardt's assertion that he filed motions for fees before that date. Gebhardt's declaration, which indicates the hours that he worked on the appellant's case, was signed November 22, 1995, and the appellant's declaration in support of Gebhardt's fee motion was signed on February 22, 1996. Indeed, Gebhardt's declaration was signed within the time limit for filing a timely motion for fees from the September 29, 1995, initial decision. We need not decide, however, whether Gebhardt actually filed fee motions before July 5, 1996, and whether any of those motions were timely from the September 29, 1995, initial decision, because, as explained below, we find [&#8197;] that there is good cause for any untimely filing from that initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We base this finding of good cause on the following: The unusual nature of the parties' settlement agreement, providing for dismissal without prejudice to refiling; the lack of notice of the right to file an attorney fee request in the initial decision dismissing the appeal without prejudice under the settlement agreement; and the relationship between the earlier appeal and the later one, both involving the same merits issues. Further, we base our good cause finding on the fact that the appellant timely filed a motion for attorney fees after receiving notice of that filing deadline in the later initial decision. The May 3, 1996, initial decision became the final decision of the Board on June 8, 1996. A timely motion for attorney fees based on the May 3, 1996, initial decision therefore must have been filed by July 7, 1996. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.37. The appellant's motion for fees filed on July 5, 1996 therefore constitutes a timely motion for attorney fees based on Gebhardt's services from the May 3, 1996, initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Olson,</span> 62 MSPR at 264; <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 32 MSPR 643, 647 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board excused a fee petition late by a day when the petition was earlier mailed to the agency. The Board excused the delay because it was short and because "the appellant intended to file with the Board, but instead sent [the fee petition] to the agency and one-day later filed a copy with the Board." <span class="Italic">Pidock v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 64 MSPR 322, 325 (1994) (relying on <span class="Italic">Sanford v. DOD</span>, 61 MSPR 207, 209 (1994)).

EEOC</span>, 45 MSPR 693, 698 (1990) (if incorrect information concerning the processing of a fee petition came from the AJ, the AJ may have to supply evidence on the issue and, as a result, the appeal must be assigned to another AJ).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sequential Board orders issued as an appeal is processed will also be evaluated to determine whether an order contributed to a late fee petition, <span class="Italic">Brackins v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 535, 539-42 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deadline for filing a motion for fees in this case was January 24, 1994, twenty-five days after the Board issued a final decision on December 30, 1993. The appellant filed his motion on February 2, 1994, nine days later. The appellant argues that, because his attorney misunderstood the language in the Board's orders, he believed that he was filing the motion well in advance. In addition, the appellant contends that his earlier submission of the motion should have "stayed or interrupted the running of the prescriptive period."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's February 11 submission appears to raise a legitimate question regarding the clarity of the information the appellant received concerning the filing deadline at issue here. A prudent person could reasonably have misconstrued the language of the initial decision and the Board's final decision to indicate that, as with the initial decision, the full Board's decision dismissing the agency's petition for review would not become final until after expiration of the period for appeal. This is particularly true inasmuch as the full Board's decision did not mention attorney fees at all. The result is that the appellant has tried to file for fees twice and has been rejected first for being too early, and then for being too late.</p>

In the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> decision, the Board found that its regulations include no specific criteria for determining when good cause has been shown for waiving a time limitation and that policy considerations counsel against dismissals for untimely filing and for <span id="Page_4724"></span>providing employees with a hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPR at 183-84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has identified several factors to be considered in a determination of whether good cause has been shown, including, but not limited to, the length of the delay; notice of the time limits; the existence of circumstances beyond the party's control; the presence or degree of negligence in the party's actions and whether that neglect is excusable; and the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency resulting from a waiver of the time limits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Excusable neglect is that neglect which a reasonably prudent person might manifest under the circumstances. Prejudice to the agency is the degree to which the agency is hampered in its ability to adequately and effectively defend its action because of the untimeliness of appellant's filing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The factual circumstances alleged here indicate that the appellant may have acted diligently and with prudence. Although a premature filing does not stay the running of the prescriptive period, it may be considered among the circumstances showing good cause for an untimely filing. In an apparent excess of caution initially, and possibly based on a misunderstanding resulting from the Board's "no later than" language, the appellant filed a premature motion for attorney fees. Then, apparently misconstruing the Board's language regarding the finality of its decision, the appellant refiled his motion immediately upon expiration of the period for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellant may have misunderstood the orders, but he appears to have been diligent in attempting to file his motion. <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 999 F.2d at 534-35 (good cause was shown by the diligent efforts of the appellant and his attorney to comply with the time limits despite being hampered by medical problems and the appellant's inability to contact his representative at various times).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a failure to understand direct and explicit language does not generally constitute good cause for an untimely filing, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Caldwell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 58 MSPR 54, 57 (1993), the language in the Board's orders was not explicit and, in some measure, it may have contributed to the appellant's failure to understand, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (ambiguous language in the Board's orders, including the omission of a specific date, constituted inadequate notice of the filing deadlines and provided a basis for a waiver of the time limits); <span class="Italic">see also Olson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 261, 264 (lack of notice of right to file a motion for attorney fees is a factor in the finding of good cause for untimeliness), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 39 F.3d 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's failure to contact the Board for an explanation of the language at issue also may not reflect a lack of diligence. Although sometimes relevant, this factor may be inapposite here. If the appellant believed he understood the language correctly, he may have believed he had no reason to contact the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also notes that the appellant's representative was a "licensed attorney" and argues that he is guilty of negligence in failing to understand the language. The Board has consistently held that an appellant is responsible for the actions of his representative and will not be allowed to escape the consequences of improper action by casting the blame on his representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). Further, an appellant and his representative (whether the representative is an attorney or not) are responsible for understanding Board procedures. In addition, the fact that the appellant was represented by an attorney is relevant in determining whether good cause has been shown. <span class="Italic">See Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583 (the employee's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status was a factor in the court's conclusion that good cause for untimeliness had been shown). Nevertheless, we find that the instructions the appellant and his attorney were given may have been unclear enough to cause the attorney's error to be excusable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may not await compliance with a final decision before filing for counsel fees. <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span>, 33 MSPR 28, 29 (1987) ("[t]he date on which the agency fully complies with the Board order is irrelevant to a determination of whether a motion for an award of attorney fees was timely filed."); <span class="Italic">Mynard v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MYNARD_DON_A_DA_0831_06_0436_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_313430.pdf">108 MSPR 58</a>, 63-64 &#x00B6; 8, 2008 MSPB 23 (2008) (delayed compliance did not excused a delayed fee motion); <span class="Italic">Triplett v. DLA</span>, 22 MSPR 657 (1984) (Table) (no delay was justified while awaiting compliance); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for Arts</span>, 14 MSPR 343, 344 (1983) ("any delay by an agency in complying with a final Board order granting relief to a party does not affect the finality of the Board's decision or show 'good cause' for the untimeliness of a motion for attorney fees"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Delay in filing a fee petition is not excused by an agency request for reconsideration or by delay in compliance. <span class="Italic">McDermott v. District of Columbia Gov't</span>, 20 MSPR 534, 535 (1984), and 22 MSPR 439, 440 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Steele v. MSPB</span>, 546 Fed. Appx. 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) (affirming Board decision finding untimely a fee petition delayed until compliance was achieved with the Board merits decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hamilton v. OPM</span>, DC-0831-10-0145-A-1 (NP 10/19/2011), dismissed as untimely a fee petition delayed while compliance was awaited:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may waive the time limit for filing a motion for attorney fees if the appellant establishes good cause for the untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Mynard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). To establish good cause, the appellant must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). In determining whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his attorney fee motion. <span class="Italic">See Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to the show cause order on timeliness, the appellant contends that the delay in filing was due to the agency's delay in complying with the Board's July 21, 2010 order. However, the date on which an agency fully complies with a Board order is irrelevant to a determination of whether the appellant acted diligently and prudently with respect to his request for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Mynard</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see Ballentine v. Department of Justice</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 28, 29 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 845 F.2d 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table). Furthermore, the appellant's 1 month delay in filing is significant. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 3 (1998). Thus, notwithstanding the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, we conclude that he has not shown good cause for the delay in filing, and we therefore dismiss his motion for attorney fees as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The expectation that future legal services may be required does not justify a late fee petition, <span class="Italic">Solis v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 584, 586 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant's motion for attorney fees was filed more than three months late. Appellant never claimed that he was unaware of the time limit for filing such a motion or that circumstances beyond his control prevented him from doing so. With regard to appellant's argument that his attorney was still representing him in matters relating to his annuity claim, we find that any delay in OPM's disbursement or computation of benefits does not excuse appellant's failure to timely file a motion for fees. Any delay by OPM in complying with a Board decision granting an appellant's application for disability retirement does not affect the finality of the Board's decision. Moreover, a request for attorneys fees that may be incurred while obtaining compliance from OPM after the issuance of an initial decision would be resolved by the presiding official after receipt of a supplemental motion for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforcement proceedings can cause problems concerning the timing of fee petitions filed to recover fees only for the compliance phase of the case. It can be difficult to pinpoint when compliance has been fully achieved; multiple enforcement petitions may be required during a single case. Normally a fee motion cannot be filed until after the compliance initial decision becomes final; otherwise, the request is premature. <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 41 MSPR 385, 391 (1989); <span class="Italic">Hardney v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 599, 600-01 (1987) (noting AJ's dismissal of what appeared to be a fee petition that was filed before the AJ completely adjudicated a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 32 MSPR 488, 495 (1987) ("To the extent that appellant requests reimbursement for attorney fees and costs incurred in opposing his improper removal, such request must be raised in a timely filed request for attorney fees under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.37, and is not properly raised on petition for enforcement under 5 C.F.R. Part 1201, Subpart F.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there are multiple related enforcement petitions, when should a fee petition be filed? The best practice is to file a fee petition after each compliance decision. In an appeal involving two sets of enforcement proceedings, counsel waited until completion of the second proceeding to file a fee petition. The Board allowed time for both proceedings. The consolidated fee petition was allowed because the split proceedings had been treated in a consolidated fashion throughout the litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. FAA</span>, 32 MSPR 643, 647-48 (1987). Complications involving compliance excused some delay in <span class="Italic">Pfaehler v. MSPB</span>, 783 F.2d 187 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The court refused to preclude consideration of an appellant's fee request because she was unaware of the Board's regulatory filing period. She received no specific notice of the Board regulation. Nor was her motion precluded because she had not filed her fee request until after compliance proceedings were completed. It was reasonable for a <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> appellant to believe that the Board's decision was not final after her agency filed a motion to stay the Board's reinstatement order during the time it took OPM to consider a request by the agency to seek reconsideration of the Board order. A late fee petition was excused when there were various appeals, petitions for judicial review, motions for stays, and motions for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Hutchison v. DHHS</span>, 42 MSPR 302, 307 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Collateral litigation of a case in district court or in other forums was insufficient to excuse a fee petition filed long after an initial decision on the merits became final, <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-94-0233-A-6 (NP 4/4/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he timely filed his July 14, 2010 petition for attorney fees. He appears to assert that the time period for filing a fee <span id="Page_4725"></span>petition with the Board began running once the District Court issued its June 24, 2010 decision finding it lacks the authority to award fees for work performed before the Board. The appellant further contends that he was not required to file a fee petition with the Board until: (1) the litigation had otherwise completed its practical course in his compliance appeals before the Board, the Federal Circuit, the District Court and the Third Circuit; (2) he prevailed in his District Court compliance appeal and in his Board removal appeal; (3) the District Court determined that it lacked the authority to award fees for work performed before the Board; and (4) the agency breached the 2004 settlement agreement in failing to pay attorney fees incurred during the removal appeal after he prevailed in the compliance matters. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the appellant alleges that it was unclear what the proper forum was for filing a fee petition for work performed before the Board during the removal appeal and that he was not required to file a Board fee petition until after the District Court determined that it lacked the authority to award such fees, this argument is without merit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) governs the award of attorney fees for work performed before the Board and clearly provides that the Board or the administrative judge may require the agency to pay reasonable attorney fees incurred by a prevailing employee. <span class="Italic">See Price v. Social Security Administration,</span> 398 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2005). As a member of the bar, the appellant's attorney had an affirmative duty to be cognizant of all provisions of law affecting his client's rights, including the pertinent statutes and regulations governing the award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Shelton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. 80, 82 (1982); <span class="Italic">see also Mynard</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 9. Furthermore, the July 19, 2001 decision clearly apprised the appellant of his right to request attorney fees, and expressly stated "you must file a motion for attorney fees WITHIN 60 CALENDAR DAYS OF THE DATE OF THIS DECISION. You must file your attorney fees motion with the office that issued the initial decision on your appeal." <span class="Italic">Schultz,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. at 129 (capitalization in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant asserts that he has "delayed prevailing party status," and therefore the Board should find that Board attorney fees proceedings are timely if "they are 'delayed until after completion of all proceedings on [appeal].'" He relies upon several Federal Circuit decisions including, but not limited to, <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice,</span> 552 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2009) and <span class="Italic">Beta Systems, Inc. v. United States</span>, 866 F.2d 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In <span class="Italic">Ramos,</span> the Federal Circuit found that the Board lacks the authority to award fees incurred before the Federal Circuit on interim appeal. <span class="Italic">Ramos,</span> 552 F.3d at 1359-61. In <span class="Italic">Beta Systems, Inc.,</span> the Federal Circuit denied the government's request to bifurcate the petitioner's request for attorney fees incurred before the Claims Court and fees incurred before the Federal Circuit in his appeal of the Claims Court decision and held that a prevailing party is not barred from filing a petition for recovery of attorney fees upon final appellate judgment accompanied by remand. <span class="Italic">Beta Systems, Inc.,</span> 866 F.2d at 1405-06.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has not sought an award of fees incurred before the Federal Circuit on interim appeal. Nor has he sought an award of fees incurred while litigating an appeal of the Board's decision before the Federal Circuit. It is undisputed that the appellant did not appeal the July 19, 2001 final decision on the merits to our reviewing court, and there is no indication that the appellant appealed the merits of the removal action in any other judicial forum. Thus, he has not shown the applicability of "delayed prevailing party" status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the appellant delayed filing his petition for fees because of the ongoing compliance proceedings in several different forums over the course of 10 years, these proceedings are irrelevant to the timing for filing a fee petition regarding the merits of the agency action. The Board has held that "the date on which the agency fully complies with the Board order is irrelevant to a determination of whether a motion for an award of attorney fees was timely filed." <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. Department of Justice,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 28, 29 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 845 F.2d 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table); <span class="Italic">see Mynard</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 8 10, 29 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 845 F.2d 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table) (finding the time period for filing a fee petition was triggered by the date the initial decision on the merits became final, not by the date the compliance initial decision became final). Even if the Board made repeated errors in the compliance proceedings as the appellant asserts and "made it erroneously appear that there were timeliness issues[&#8197;] in the pursuit of enforcement for payment of back pay," and the agency conceded to the timeliness of the appellant's September 17, 2001 petition for enforcement during the District Court matter, the timeliness of the petition for enforcement has no bearing on the attorney fees matter.</p>
