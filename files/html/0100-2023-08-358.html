<p class="Body-Text">Some statutory and regulatory citations that appear in the decisions discussed in this section are reprinted below. This is a partial listing; all OPM regulations and statutory citations appearing in the cases should be reviewed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3320 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Excepted service; government of the District of Columbia; selection.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service in the executive branch and in the government of the District of Columbia from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of this title. This section does not apply to an appointment required by Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the Senate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations in part provide, 5 CFR Part 302 (2022), "Employment in the Excepted Service":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">302.101 <span class="Italic">Positions covered by regulations.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions covered</span>. With respect to the application of veteran preference, this part applies to each position in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government that is not in the competitive service and that is subject to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, or subject to a statutory requirement to follow the veteran preference provisions of title 5. With respect to restoration rights that are due to compensable injury and appeals therefrom, this part applies to those positions covered by 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) that are not in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions not covered</span>. This part does not apply to a position or appointment that is required by the Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the Senate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions exempt from appointment procedures</span>. In view of the circumstances and conditions surrounding employment in the following classes of positions, an agency is not required to apply the appointment procedures of this part to them, but each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible and, on the request of a qualified and available preference eligible, shall furnish him/her with the reasons for his/her nonselection. Also, the exemption from the appointment procedures of this part does not relieve agencies of their obligation to accord persons entitled to priority consideration (see &#x00A7; 302.103) their rights under 5 U.S.C. 8151:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Positions filled by persons appointed without pay or at pay of $1 a year;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Positions outside the continental United States and outside the State of Hawaii and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico when filled by persons resident in the locality, and positions in the State of Hawaii and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico when paid in accordance with prevailing wage rates;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Positions which the exigencies of the national defense program demand be filled immediately before lists of qualified applicants can be established or used, but appointments to these positions shall be temporary appointments not to exceed 1 year which may be renewed for 1 additional year at the discretion of the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Positions filled by appointees serving on an irregular or occasional basis whose hours or days of work are not based on a prearranged schedule and who are paid only for the time when actually employed or for services actually performed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Positions paid on a fee basis;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Positions included in Schedule A (see subpart C of part 213 of this chapter) and similar types of positions when OPM agrees with the agency that the positions should be included hereunder;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;Positions included in Schedule C (see subpart C of part 213 of this chapter) and positions excepted by statute which are of a confidential, policy-making, or policy-advocating nature;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;Attorney positions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(9)&#x2003; Positions filled by reemployment of an individual in the same agency and commuting area, at the same or lower grade, and under the same appointing authority as the position last held; <span class="Italic">Provided That</span>, there are no candidates eligible for the position on the agency's priority reemployment list established in accordance with &#x00A7; 302.303.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Efthimiadis alleges generally a violation of her veterans' rights under VPA, and brings her claim under VEOA, which creates a right of redress for actions taken after October 30, 1998 that violate an individual's veterans' preference rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a) and (d) (2000); <span class="Italic">se</span>e a<span class="Italic">lso Campion v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">People may be employed in the Army in the "competitive service" or the "excepted service." Veterans eligible for preferences are defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3) (2000) as "preference eligible" and in the competitive service, five points may be added to added to [sic] a veteran's quantitative total, and ten to a disabled veteran's total, in an evaluation for a position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309(1) (2000) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Efthimiadis argued to the Board that, as a preference-eligible veteran, points should have been given to her during the evaluation of her application. However, such a specific preferential method is not required in the excepted service. Section 5 of the C.F.R. 302.101(c)(9) states that for attorney positions, "the principle of veteran preference [should be followed] as far as administratively feasible. The Board's final judgment must be sustained if this court determines that substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that the Army has proven its case by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">se</span>e a<span class="Italic">lso</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii) (2004); <span class="Italic">Consolo v.

This court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that substantial evidence supports the Board's decision that the Army did follow "the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VPA establishes veterans' preference in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302 (2000), stating that "preference shall be given to preference eligibles...in appointment...in the excepted service."

<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the relationship of &#x00A7; 302.101(c) to Ms. Efthimiadis's case, the Board stated, "In sum, the agency complies with the law by considering a preference eligible's service as a positive factor in her application, even if it does not assign points to veterans in ranking applicants for attorney positions." The Board did not, however, cite any explicit evidence in the record that shows the Army viewed Ms. Efthimiadis's veterans' preference eligibility (or that of any other candidate) as a "positive factor." Ms. Efthimiadis was ranked ninth during the selection process; like her, the top four candidates were also preference-eligibles. The application of the principle of veterans' preference to Ms. Efthimiadis would not have changed her position in relation to the top four candidates during the selection process. Therefore, Ms. Efthimiadis was not harmed by the ultimate decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) (2004) (definition of harmful error); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) (2000).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's third argument, we modify the initial decision to find that the agency met its obligation to follow veterans' preference principles as far as administratively feasible. OPM has determined that Schedule A positions are exempt from excepted-service appointment procedures. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(6). An agency is required to "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c). Concerning excepted-service positions that are not subject to examination, an agency may meet this requirement by considering veterans' preference as a positive factor. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1159 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Jarrard v.

We find that it is self-evident that the agency viewed veterans' preference status as a positive factor in the selection process because the only qualified applicants were veterans who had recovered or were recovering from a mental health condition. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7402(b)(13)(A) (requiring that an individual appointed as a peer specialist must "be a veteran who has recovered or is recovering from a mental health condition"). Therefore, we find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reference to a "positive factor" is not to OPM regulations. The phrase was apparently used to implement the regulatory requirement at 5 CFR 302.101(c) for excepted service appointments that "each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible and, on the request of a qualified and available preference eligible...." The "positive factor" appears to surface first in an AJ's initial decision, <span class="Italic">Wilks v.

<p class="Body-Text">Whatever its provenance, the "positive factor" approach toward the application for preference involving excepted service selection procedures for (excepted <span id="Page_639"></span>service) attorneys was endorsed beyond the confines of an Army regulation, <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1155-59 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides redress for a preference eligible veteran "who alleges that an agency has violated...[his or her] rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A) (Supp. 2005). Veterans' preference rights are defined by the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 ("VPA"), Pub. L. No. 78-359, 58 Stat. 387 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2108, 3309-3320), and its attendant regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.101-302.403 (2005). The VPA generally gives a qualifying veteran, known as a "preference eligible," various preferences in applying for civil service positions within the competitive and excepted services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, and of relevance to this appeal, section 3309 of title 5 provides preference eligibles with additional rating points in applying for positions in the competitive service. It reads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A preference eligible who receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive service is entitled to additional points above his earned rating, as follows--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;a preference eligible under section 2108(3)(C)-(G) of this title--10 points; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;a preference eligible under section 2108(3)(A) of this title--5 points.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, although on its face section 3309 appears to apply only to positions within the competitive service, Congress, through 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, has extended veterans' preference rights to the excepted service as well:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service...from the qualified applicants <span class="Italic">in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of this title</span>. This section does not apply to an appointment required by Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the Senate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress delegated the responsibility for implementing section 3320 to the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(c). Accordingly, OPM has issued regulations setting forth procedures for applying veterans' preference rights to the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. pt. 302. OPM's regulations state that the general rating and ranking procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 apply to nominations and appointments in the excepted service when an agency uses numerical scoring in evaluating applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When numerical scores are used in the evaluation and referral, the agency shall grant 5 additional points to preference eligibles under section 2108(3)(A) and (B) of title 5...and 10 additional points to preference eligibles under section 2108(3)(C) through (G) of that title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.201(a) (2005). However, not all appointments within the excepted service are made using numerical rate and ranking procedures. For these positions, OPM's regulations provide for a more qualitative accounting of veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 302.201(b) ("When eligible candidates are referred without ranking, the agency shall note preference as 'CP' for preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(c), as 'XP' for preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3) (D) through (G), and as 'TP' for all other preference eligibles under that title.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, OPM has wholly exempted some positions within the excepted service from the appointment procedures of 5 C.F.R. Part 302. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 302.101(c). For these exempted positions, OPM simply directs agencies to "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As already seen, in this case the agency treated Mr. Patterson's status as a veteran as a "positive factor." OPM views the positive factor test as consistent with the requirement of section 302.101(c) that, in hiring for certain positions in the excepted service, agencies "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible." OPM includes attorney positions within this exemption. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Patterson's VEOA claim appears to be that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by failing to rate and rank his application and by failing to accord him 5 additional rating points under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 as a preference eligible. The government's response is that the agency properly accounted for Mr. Patterson's status as a preference eligible by counting it as a positive factor under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c) in its review of his application. Mr. Patterson rejoins that the agency still violated his veterans' preference rights in applying the positive factor test because OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), from which the positive factor test flows, is invalid as contrary to the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Patterson emphasizes that the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 states that "[t]he nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service...from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of...title[5]." Moreover, Mr. Patterson continues, section 3309 expressly entitles a preference eligible to an additional 5 or 10 points in his or her qualifying rating and ranking. Accordingly, Mr. Patterson asserts that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), which merely requires an agency to "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible," is invalid as contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3320. Mr. Patterson further asserts that the positive factor test, which is OPM's test for implementing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), is similarly invalid. Mr. Patterson contends therefore that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by following the "administratively feasible" and "positive factor" tests and thereby failing to properly account for the 5 additional points to which he was entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 as a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government, on the other hand, contends that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c) was promulgated pursuant to OPM's delegated authority to administer the VPA and is thus entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The government further contends that, in promulgating 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), OPM struck a reasonable balance between the VPA's goal of affording veterans hiring preferences in the excepted service and the excepted service's goal of providing agencies with flexibility in hiring for certain specified positions. In fact, the government asserts, accepting Mr. Patterson's interpretation of the VPA and, specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3320, would effectively eliminate the purpose of the excepted service, by requiring agencies to follow formal examination, rating, and ranking procedures before filling any vacancies in that service. The government similarly contends that the positive factor test, embodying OPM's interpretation of how to implement 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 303.101(c), is also valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As reflected by the arguments of the parties, Mr. Patterson's VEOA claim concerns the procedures used by the agency in filling attorney vacancies. It is undisputed that attorney positions are within the excepted service and that, in making appointments to attorney positions, the agency does not examine and numerically rank applicants.[5] It also is undisputed that, through 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9), attorneys fall within OPM's exemption, which merely requires application of veterans' preference rights "as far as administratively feasible." Therefore, the specific issue before us is whether OPM acted within its delegated authority in promulgating 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Pursuant to its delegated authority, OPM has created three schedules of excepted service positions: Schedule A, Schedule B, and Schedule C. 5 C.F.R. pt. 213 (2005). Schedule A is of relevance to this case, and is titled, "Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is impracticable to examine." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 213.3101. "Examining," for purposes of Schedule A, means "application of the qualification standards and requirements established for the competitive service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "Attorneys" are specifically listed in Schedule A. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 213.3102(d). Attorney positions are therefore within the excepted service. As a result, applicants for them are not subject to examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When we review the validity of an agency's interpretation of a statute, our first task is to determine "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842. That is because, "[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter," because we "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 842-43. However, "if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Doe v. United States</span>, 372 F.3d 1347, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "precise question" addressed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) is how an agency should apply veterans' preference principles in making hiring decisions for filling attorney vacancies. We do not think Congress has addressed this question. It is true that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 states that nominations and appointments to the excepted service are to be made "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of...title[5]." It also is true that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309, relating to the examination of preference eligibles for positions in the competitive service, states that a qualifying preference eligible is entitled to an increase of 5 points in his or her rating score (10 points if the preference eligible is disabled). However, section 3309 also provides that the increased rating is conditioned on the preference eligible "receiv[ing] a passing grade <span class="Italic">in an examination</span> for entrance into the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Meeker v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The Veterans' Preference Act makes clear that veteran preference points, as applicable, are added to the score of a candidate who 'receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive service.'"). In addition, while examinations are commonly required for appointments in the competitive service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, the President is specifically authorized to make exceptions to the examination requirement, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 3302(2); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 3304(b). Therefore, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 is silent on the issue of how agencies should apply veterans' preference rights to a preference <span id="Page_640"></span>eligible in the competitive service who is not required to pass an examination. As seen, section 3320 of title 5 refers to examinations and appointments to the excepted service being made "in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of...title[5]." It therefore necessarily follows that Congress has not spoken on the issue of how to apply the principles of veterans' preference to positions within the excepted service that are not subject to examination. In other words, Congress left a "gap" in the VPA on this issue, and the regulations issued by OPM to fill this gap are therefore entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Cable &#x0026; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs.</span>, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 2700 (2005) ("<span class="Italic">Chevron</span>'s premise is that it is for agencies, not courts, to fill statutory gaps."); <span class="Italic">see also Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843-44. OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) fills this gap, since applicants for attorney vacancies in the excepted service are not subject to examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next must determine whether OPM's gap-filling regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) is reasonable and consistent with the VPA. We conclude that it is. The purpose of the VPA is to provide preference eligible veterans with additional benefits in seeking employment within the civil service system. Section 3309 of title 5 does this by providing for set increases in the rating of preference eligibles who receive a passing score on an agency's examination. In the excepted service, OPM still requires agencies to follow this scheme "[w]hen numerical scores are used in the evaluation and referral" of the applicants. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.201; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> &#x00A7; 302.302(b). However, for attorney positions, OPM has recognized that this scheme is not workable because agencies do not use numerical scores in assessing applicants for such positions. OPM has consequently directed agencies to "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 302.101(c). The agency has interpreted, and OPM has agreed, that this means an agency must consider veteran status as a "positive factor" in reviewing applications. We think this approach represents a reasonable balance between the goals of the VPA and the flexible hiring standards employed by the excepted service for filling attorney vacancies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Patterson essentially seeks an interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3320 that would require numerical scoring and ranking in evaluating applicants for all positions within the excepted service. Mr. Patterson argues that such a requirement would not require formal "examination" of the applicants, just numerical ranking based on a comparison of the applicants' qualifications to the agency's description of the position's requirements. We do not find this argument persuasive. For one thing, as a practical matter, we do not see how Mr. Patterson's interpretation would not require agency examinations. His interpretation therefore ignores 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, which allows the President (and, thus, OPM) to except designated positions in the excepted service from the procedures utilized in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Mr. Patterson's proposed interpretation--that is, his contention that agencies could numerically rate and rank attorney applicants without subjecting them to an "examination"--is, at best, simply another possible interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3320. It is well settled law, however, that where <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is due, our role is not to substitute the agency's interpretation with what we think might be a better interpretation. Rather, our role is limited to assessing whether the agency's interpretation is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843 n.11 ("[A] court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency."). In this case, we hold that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) represents a reasonable interpretation of how 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3320 apply to attorney positions within the excepted service. The positive factor test, in turn, strikes us as a reasonable way of "follow[ing] the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c), in the case of a preference eligible applying for an excepted service attorney position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, because the agency considered Mr. Patterson's status as a preference eligible a positive factor in evaluating his application, we agree with the Board that Mr. Patterson failed to assert a violation of his veterans' preference rights. We thus see no error in the Board's dismissal of his VEOA claim. We do think, though, that the dismissal should have been for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, rather than for lack of jurisdiction. The Board had jurisdiction to consider Mr. Patterson's claim, which was brought under the VEOA. However, the claim failed on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Do-Well Machine Shop, Inc. v.

Under the VEOA, veterans "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).

Although the Agency did not expressly state in its October 6, 2004 letter to Light that it considered his veteran status as a "positive factor" that was outweighed by the Agency's prior experience with Light, we presume that, in noting Light's veteran status, the Agency properly discharged its administrative duty to consider Light's veteran status as a "positive factor," which in this case was outweighed by Light's history with the Agency. <span class="Italic">See Miley v.

Because Light has not presented clear evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity, we therefore agree with the Board that Light's rights under the VEOA were not violated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another decision involving veteran applying for an attorney position, <span class="Italic">Pope v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 421 F.3d 480, 481-82 (7th Cir. 2005), the court discerned no enforceable mandate--no clear regulatory guidance--that the agency provide a preference to the applicant for the excepted service position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pope applied unsuccessfully for a job as a lawyer with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, a part of the Department of Transportation. He has sued the department under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330b, enacted as part of the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3182, claiming that he would have gotten the job had he received the veteran preference to which he was entitled. The district court dismissed the suit on the government's motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Safety Administration treated Pope's being a veteran as merely a tie breaker: he would get the job only if he were as good as the best competing applicant; and he wasn't. Pope points out that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309 entitles veterans to the addition of five or ten points (depending on disability, family status, and other factors) to their scores on job examinations. But this supposes an examination; and the only statutory requirement of an examination is for filling jobs in what is called the "competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dept. of Health &#x0026; Human Services v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The words we've italicized indicate the extreme vagueness of this mandate, in light of which the decision of the Safety Administration to treat veteran status as merely a tie breaker cannot be thought an abuse of discretion. This would be the applicable legal standard for us to use, given the lack of direction in the regulation, were this a case of judicial review of agency action governed by the Administrative Procedure Act. <span class="Italic">Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA</span>, 540 U.S. 461, 496-97 (2004); <span class="Italic">United States v. Bean</span>, 537 U.S. 71, 77 (2002). It is not; the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act authorizes a veteran to "file an action with the appropriate United States district court" if, as in this case, the Merit Systems Protection Board does not issue its decision within 120 days, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330b, in which event there is no administrative adjudication to review. <span class="Italic">Compare United States v. Bean, supra</span>, 537 U.S. at 74 n.1. So the question for the district court and this court was simply whether the tie-breaker rule utilized by the employing agency was consistent with the regulation.<span class="Italic"> See Chandler v. Roudebush</span>, 425 U.S. 840 (1976); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 412 F.3d 1258, 1263-64 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But nothing of practical significance turns on the difference in judicial standards. Because the regulation is wholly nondirective, the tie-breaker rule would have to be arbitrary indeed to violate it; it is not arbitrary, and there is therefore no basis for the courts' second guessing the agency. By granting unguided discretion to the employing agency, the regulation left little room for judicial review. <span class="Italic">United States v. Taylor</span>, 487 U.S. 326, 336 (1988) (where Congress has "merely committed the choice of remedy to the discretion of district courts, without specifying factors to be considered...appellate review of that determination necessarily would be limited"); <span class="Italic">Schurz Communications, Inc. v. FCC</span>, 982 F.2d 1043, 1048 (7th Cir. 1992) (where statute "provides no guidance" for exercise of authority "other than that the Commission is to act in accordance with the public interest, convenience, or necessity...so nebulous a mandate invests the Commission with an enormous discretion and correspondingly limits the practical scope of responsible judicial review"); <span class="Italic">Connecticut Dept. of Children &#x0026; Youth Services v.

<p class="Body-Text">Attorney hiring was again considered under VEOA with respect to the application of 5 USC 3318, involving the "passover" process for preference eligibles, including those with service-connected disabilities of 30% or more, in <span class="Italic">Jarrard v. SSA</span>, 115 MSPR 397, 398, 400-08 &#x00B6; 2, 9-27, 2010 MSPB 207 (2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Jarrard v. SSA</span>, 669 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determining that the passover process could not and would not be required in cases of appointments of excepted service attorneys:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a preference eligible veteran with an 80 percent service-connected disability. The agency announced vacancies for an unspecified number of Attorney Advisor positions, and the appellant filed an application, notifying the agency that he was a preference eligible disabled veteran. The agency subsequently notified the appellant that it had not selected him for an appointment, and the appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL), arguing that the agency violated his rights under VEOA because it failed to offer him a position without following the passover requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318. DOL issued a decision, finding that the appellant failed to establish that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this appeal is whether the agency violated the appellant's rights as a preference eligible veteran with an 80 percent service-connected disability when it selected a non-preference eligible applicant for the Attorney Advisor position to which he applied without following the passover provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318. Under section 3318, where an agency intends "to pass over a preference eligible on a certificate" in favor of a non-preference eligible, the agency must file written reasons for its intended passover with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and OPM must determine whether the agency has provided a sufficient basis to warrant the intended passover. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1). If the preference eligible is, like the appellant, a veteran with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, he will have the opportunity to respond to the agency's stated reasons for the intended passover, and OPM must consider his response in rendering its decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1)-(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 applies only to appointments in the competitive service. However, as the appellant correctly argues, it also applies to appointments in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 ("The nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service...from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of this title."); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347, 1351-53 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The agency argues, however, that the section 3318 passover procedures do not apply to selections for attorney positions because they apply only to applicants who are subject to an examination, and attorney positions are a special category of excepted service positions whose applicants are not subject to an examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the premise that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 applies only to applicants who are subject to an examination, the agency reasons as follows. By its terms, section 3318 is applicable only to applicants who are "available for appointment on [a] <span class="Italic">certificate</span> furnished under section 3317(a) of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a) (emphasis supplied). Section 3317(a), in turn, provides that OPM[3] "shall certify enough names from the top of the appropriate register to permit a nominating or appointing authority who has requested a certificate of eligibles to consider at least three names for appointment to each vacancy." Such a register consists of "[t]he names of applicants who have qualified <span class="Italic">in examinations</span> for the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313 (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Pursuant to its authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(2), OPM has delegated this function to employing agencies through interagency agreements. <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM's 2007 Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, Chapter 1 &#x00A7; A, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="http://www.opm.gov/deu/">http://www.opm.gov/deu/</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>] (follow "Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, 2007" hyperlink).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the premise that applicants for the Attorney Advisor position at issue were not subject to an examination, the agency reasons as follows. In <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1156-58 &#x0026; n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court found that the agency did not assign numerical scores when it assessed applicants for an Attorney Advisor position, and that the agency was not required to do so because attorney positions are in Schedule A of the excepted service, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(d), which covers positions "which are not of a confidential or policy-determining character...for which it is not practicable to examine," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101. Moreover, Congress has specifically forbidden the executive branch from developing an examination for attorneys. As explained in <span class="Italic">Fiorentino v. United States</span>, 607 F.2d 963, 966 (Ct. Cl. 1979), in 1943 the President directed the Civil Service Commission, which at that time was the central personnel authority for the executive branch, to create a "Legal Examining Unit" for the purpose of examining applicants for federal attorney positions. Congress opposed the idea and responded by prohibiting the Commission from using appropriated funds to finance the Legal Examining Unit. Congress has similarly prohibited OPM, the Civil Service Commission's successor agency, from using any part of its appropriation "for salaries and expenses of [its] Legal Examining Unit...or any successor unit of like purpose." Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-8, 123 Stat. 524, 669 (2009); Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161, 121 Stat. 1844, 2008-09 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board agrees with the agency's reasoning, and we find, for the reasons explained above, that applicants for Schedule A attorney positions are not subject to an OPM examination within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313, and are therefore not placed on a certificate of eligibles within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). Since executive agencies hold their authority to examine and select for appointment by delegation from OPM, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(a)(2), it follows that executive agencies may not conduct examinations for attorney positions, <span class="Italic">see</span> Restatement (Second) of Agency &#x00A7; 3.04 cmt. d, illus. 3 (2006) (an entity lacks capacity to authorize an agent to do an act that is not within the entity's powers conferred by statute). The appellant concedes that, in applying for the Attorney Advisor position at issue, he was neither examined nor placed on a certificate of eligibles. He argues, however, that the passover procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 still apply to attorney hiring because it is "administratively feasible" to apply them even where there is no examination and no certificate of eligibles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has authorized OPM to issue regulations implementing the statutory veterans' preference requirements, including veterans' preference requirements for excepted service hiring. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(c); <span class="Italic">see Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1156; 5 C.F.R. part 302 ("Employment in the Excepted Service"). OPM has recognized that the appointment procedures of 5 C.F.R. part 302 may not be applied to selections for certain categories of excepted service positions, including attorney positions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9). OPM has exempted selections for these positions from the <span id="Page_642"></span>part 302 appointment procedures, requiring instead that, in selecting for these positions, agencies "shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has upheld the validity of this regulation as it pertains to selections for attorney positions. <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1158-60. In <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, the appellant, a preference eligible veteran, applied for an Attorney Advisor position. 424 F.3d at 1153.

The court found that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights in this regard because, although section 3309 is generally applicable to excepted service hiring pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, it is inapplicable to attorney hiring because appointments to attorney positions are not made using numerical rating and ranking procedures pursuant to an examination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1158-59. That is, section 3309 is silent on how agencies should apply veterans' preference to selections for which there is no examination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1158.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> is inapplicable to the facts of the instant appeal because it does not address the applicability of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, the precise statute at issue here. In this regard, the appellant relies on <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1351-53, in which the court found that the agency violated the rights of a preference eligible disabled veteran who applied for an excepted service position under the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP), where the agency selected another candidate without following the procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2).[5] In <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, the court found that OPM's excepted service passover regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(b) was invalid because it afforded preference eligible disabled veterans lesser protections than those established by Congress at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(2). 550 F.3d at 1352-54. The court distinguished <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, reasoning that the statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309, was impossible to apply in the absence of an examination, and the excepted service applicants in that case were not subject to examination, but "there is no examination requirement in &#x00A7; 3318 and no analogous requirement that would preclude application of &#x00A7; 3318 to the excepted service under &#x00A7; 3320." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1353.

The appellant does not disagree with administrative judge's finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that neither <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> nor <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> speaks directly to the issue presented in the instant appeal. That is, <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> involved section 3318 but did not involve attorney hiring, whereas <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> involved attorney hiring but did not involve section 3318. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we find that the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> is applicable to facts of the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, the Attorney Advisor position for which the appellant applied is different from the FCIP position at issue in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>. The court noted in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> that the appointment challenged in that case was made under the FCIP, a Schedule B excepted service hiring authority. 550 F.3d at 1349; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o). Schedule B covers positions "which are not of a confidential or policy-determining character...for which it is impracticable to hold open competition or to apply <span class="Italic">usual</span> competitive examining procedures." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3201(a) (emphasis supplied). Thus, there was an "examination" for the FCIP position at issue in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, albeit not a "usual" one. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3201(o)(1) (requiring agencies to use the procedures of 5 C.F.R. part 302 for making appointments under the FCIP); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302 ("Examination of applicants"). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101(a) (Schedule A appointments are authorized where it is not practicable to examine) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3201(a) (Schedule B appointments are authorized where it is impracticable to apply usual competitive examining procedures). Based on this examination, the agency in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> created a "certificate" of eligibles after assessing the candidates under the excepted service category rating system. 550 F.3d at 1350; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.304, .401(a). Mr. Gingery was placed in the highest preference category, <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 550 F.3d at 1350, and according to the court, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 required the agency to apply the passover procedures at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) when selecting a non-preference eligible from the certificate over Mr. Gingery, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1353-54.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, in both <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> and the instant appeal, the appointments at issue were to attorney positions covered by Schedule A. As explained above, such appointments are exempted from the appointment procedures of 5 C.F.R. part 302, of which the category rating system is a part. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) (attorney positions are exempt from part 302 appointment procedures), .304(b)(5) (the excepted service category rating system). The Attorney Advisor position could not have been filled pursuant to the category rating system because that system requires an examination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(a) (the category rating system is established pursuant to the 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304 examining authority); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302(a) (category rating is made pursuant to an examination where numerical scores are not assigned), and, as the agency correctly argued, applicants for attorney positions cannot be lawfully subjected to an examination, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the court in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> noted that "&#x00A7; 3318 applies to selection from certificates, which are used in both the competitive and excepted services." 550 F.3d at 1353. Although this is true of excepted service hiring generally, and of the specific position at issue in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, it is not true of the Attorney Advisor position at issue here. The appellant herein cannot claim that he belonged at "the top of the...register," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a), because there was no register within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. chapter 33, subchapter I; examination is a prerequisite for placement on a register, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313, and the position that the appellant sought was not subject to an examination, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00B6; 12. Indeed, no applicant for an attorney position could credibly claim to have passed an "examination" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3320.[7] <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Even if the agency erroneously rated and ranked applicants for the Attorney Advisor position and did not follow passover procedures, VEOA would still not authorize the Board to order the agency to follow those procedures in any reconstructed selection process. Although an agency is required to factor veterans' preference points into ratings made under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.302, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.303(d), any rating that the agency might assign under that section to applicants for attorney positions would be unlawful, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, &#x00B6; 12. Because VEOA entitles a successful claimant to a selection process consistent with law, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 450, &#x00B6; 7 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2009-3255 (Fed. Cir. 2010), the administrative judge correctly found that the Board could not order the agency to continue with an unlawful rating and ranking procedure in the reconstruction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we find that it would be impossible to apply the passover procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 to the Attorney Advisor selection process in the same manner as was required for the FCIP selection process in <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>. 550 F.3d at 1353-54. Because application of section 3318 is conditioned on the preference eligible being "on a certificate," we find that it is silent as to how agencies should apply veterans' preference rights to a preference eligible who does not appear on a certificate. <span class="Italic">Cf. Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1158 (section 3309 is silent as to how agencies should apply veterans' preference rights to a preference eligible who is not required to pass an examination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 is silent as to how veterans' preference rights should apply to the selection process at issue, the Board will defer to OPM's regulation providing that, in selecting for attorney positions, agencies must "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c). The court in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> upheld the validity of this regulation with respect to the veterans' preference requirements in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309, which are inapplicable to attorney hiring because they presuppose an examination. 424 F.3d at 1158-60. Likewise, we discern no basis to find this regulation invalid with respect to the veterans' preference requirements at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, which are inapplicable to attorney hiring because they presuppose placement on a certificate. The appellant does not dispute the validity of the regulation, but he argues that in order to follow 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 "as far as administratively feasible," the agency would have to solicit OPM's permission for the intended passover, notify the preference eligible of the reasons for the proposed passover, and afford the preference eligible an opportunity to respond. He argues that the absence of an examination or a certificate of eligibles does not make it administratively unfeasible to follow the procedures of that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument is premised on an overly broad definition of the term "passover." Section 3318 specifies that the passover is on a certificate <span id="Page_643"></span>furnished under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). The very notion of "passing over" a preference eligible applicant presupposes that he encumbers a position on a certificate; a preference eligible cannot credibly claim to have been "passed over" in favor of another applicant unless he already encumbered a ranked position ahead of the other applicant on a certificate. Without such a certificate, the term "passover" as used in section 3318 is devoid of meaning. To the extent that the appellant is arguing that a "passover" is simply the selection of a non-preference eligible instead of a preference eligible regardless of whether the applicants appeared on a certificate, we find that his definition of the term is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant suggests elsewhere that "compliance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) could be accomplished by simply sending the preference eligible Veteran a letter in a timely manner." To the extent that the appellant is arguing that the agency should have to follow closely analogous procedures to those in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 when it cannot follow those procedures as written, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation provides that, in selecting for attorney positions, agencies must "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c). By its plain language, this regulation vests individual agencies with broad discretion in affording veterans' preference to applicants for attorney positions. It directs agencies to follow the "principle of veteran preference"--a generic concept; it does not direct agencies to follow specific veterans' preference requirements when those requirements cannot be applied as written. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It also directs agencies to follow the principle "as far as administratively feasible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As the agency correctly argues, this language grants it broad discretion in affording veterans' preference to applicants for attorney positions. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee Pope v. Department of Transportation</span>, 421 F.3d 480, 481-82 (7th Cir. 2005) (by granting unguided discretion to agencies in applying veterans' preference to applicants for attorney positions, the regulation leaves little room for judicial review of an agency's action). Nothing in the regulation, or in the applicable statute, requires the agency to develop its own veterans' preference requirements analogous to the statutory veterans' preference requirements when the statutory requirements are impossible to apply. Therefore, even if it were "administratively feasible" for the agency to apply procedures similar or analogous to those in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, we find that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights by exercising its discretion to apply the principle of veterans' preference in another administratively feasible way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Congress has not authorized the Board to prescribe the procedures for agencies to follow in applying veterans' preference to attorney hiring. That responsibility belongs to OPM, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(c); <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1156, and OPM has elected to leave the details of applying veterans' preference to attorney hiring up to individual agencies, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c). The appellant argues that veterans' benefit statutes such as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 should be construed in the veteran's favor. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 843 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Even so, this principle does not authorize the Board to supplant OPM's statutory authority to implement 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3318 and 3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the agency treated the appellant's veterans' preference status as a "positive factor" in its selection process. We find that the agency's decision to treat the appellant's veterans' preference status as a positive factor in evaluating his application is consistent with OPM's requirement that the agency "follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible."[8] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c); <span class="Italic">see Patterson</span>, 424 F.3d at 1159-60 (the "positive factor" test is a reasonable way of following the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)). In addition, there is no indication in the record that the agency's own rules require it to do anything other than consider veterans' preference as a positive factor when selecting for attorney positions. Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to establish that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights when it selected a non-preference eligible individual for the Attorney Advisor position to which he applied without following the passover procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318 or any analogous procedures. We deny the appellant's request for corrective action on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;To the extent that the agency argues that it need not follow any statutory veterans' preference requirement for attorney hiring as long as it treats veterans' preference as a "positive factor," we decline to decide whether the "positive factor" standard satisfies statutory veterans' preference requirements that are not inapplicable to attorney hiring.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming the Board, the Federal Circuit referenced <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> and the positive factor approach, <span class="Italic">Jarrard v. SSA</span>, 669 F.3d 1320, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, the veteran applicant for an attorney position challenged the agency's failure to apply section 3309, which requires "[a] preference eligible who receives a passing grade in an examination" to receive "additional points above his earned rating." 424 F.3d at 1154 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309). We determined that "Congress has not spoken on the issue of how to apply the principles of veterans' preference to positions within the excepted service that are not subject to examination," and that OPM's regulations are thus entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1158-59. We concluded that OPM's exemption of attorneys from excepted service veterans' preference hiring procedures at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(c)(9) is "reasonable and consistent with the VPA" because "agencies do not use numerical scores in assessing applicants for [attorney] positions." 424 F.3d at 1159. Instead, OPM agreed that the agency "must consider veteran status as a 'positive factor' in reviewing applications," which we found to "represent[ ] a reasonable balance between the goals of the VPA and the flexible hiring standards employed by the excepted service for filling attorney vacancies." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Moving beyond appointments of lawyers and the positive factor formulation, veterans preference application for excepted service hiring was explored as to appointments to temporary or term appointments from an unranked list outside of a civil service register, when the 10-point veteran is entitled to "first preference," but not to selection under 5 CFR 333.201 (1999), as <span class="Italic">Spigner v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 86 MSPR 677, 679-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-13 (2000), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Spigner v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 96 MSPR 275 (2004) (affirming nonselection), <span class="Italic">post,</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights, the appellant below relied on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(C), which states that "a veteran who is entitled to disability compensation under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or whose discharge or release from active duty was for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty shall be given preference for such an appointment over other veterans." The administrative judge found that OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401 sets forth a "rule of three" that applies when an agency fills a vacancy where some or all of the candidates are entitled to veteran's preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In particular, the administrative judge found that where, as here, the selection was made from a list of candidates who did not receive numerical scores, the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401(a) provides that "the agency must make its selection from the highest available preference category, as long as at least three candidates remain in that group." The regulation goes on to state that, as was the case here, "[w]hen fewer than three candidates remain in the highest category, consideration may be expanded to include the next category." Applying this "rule of three," the administrative judge concluded that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it selected a better-qualified 5-point veteran, who was in the category immediately below the appellant's category of 10-point veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant makes only a bare assertion that the regulation does not comport with the statute, and he does not explain what additional preference he should have received other than automatic selection for the position because of his 10-point status. Further, he continues to rely on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(C) in arguing that the agency did not accord him the appropriate veterans' preference. The appellant's arguments do not meet the Board's criteria for review<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115; <span class="Italic">Tines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 92 (1992). Further, as explained below, the Board finds that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(C) does not apply to this case. Thus, we deny the appellant's petition for review, but reopen the appeal to discuss what statute applies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he evidence shows that the agency filled the GS-07 Construction Inspector position as a temporary position for a period not to exceed one year, and that the hiring authority used to fill this position was 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201, which applies to temporary appointments in the competitive service made from a list of candidates who have not received numerical scores. The regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 333 indicate that the statutory authority for their promulgation is, among other provisions not relevant to this appeal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1302(b) of Title 5 provides that OPM shall "prescribe and enforce regulations...that implement the Congressional policy that preference shall be given to preference eligibles in certification for appointment, and in employment...in the competitive service in Executive agencies, permanent or temporary." OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201(b) implements that statutory directive and states that, for temporary appointments to positions other than professional or scientific GS-09 jobs, "preference shall be given first to preference eligibles with compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, and second to other preference eligibles." The issue therefore is whether the appellant was entitled under that regulation to be selected over the 5-point veteran.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003; In its investigation of the appellant's complaint under the <span id="Page_644"></span>VEOA, the Department of Labor found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201 governed the selection, but that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401 deals with the veterans' preference issue. Section 302.401 concerns appointments in the excepted service<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The evidence does not show whether the temporary Construction Inspector position was in the competitive or the excepted service. However, regardless of whether the position was in the competitive or the excepted service, the agency expressly acted under the authority of Part 333 in filling it, and the specific veterans' preference rule at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201 should apply, instead of the general rule at Part 302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302 does not give the appellant an entitlement to the position for which he applied. Nor does 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201(b) give him a right to the job; it only gives him "first preference" for the vacancy. In a somewhat different context, the Board has found that "priority consideration" is a term of art that means that "an employee will receive <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration by the selecting official before any other candidate is referred for consideration and that the employee will not be considered in competition with other candidates and will not be compared with them." <span class="Italic">Langston v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 597, 601 (1999), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, No. 00-3301 (Fed. Cir. June 6, 2000 (Table). The selection certificate with just the appellant's name suggests that he was considered solely on the merits of his application. Further, a statement from the selecting official indicates that, given the appellant's lack of experience, he would not have been selected for the position in any event. Thus, we find that the agency properly considered the appellant along with 5-point veterans, and he was given a "first preference" when the selection was made. The regulatory history of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201 supports this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulatory history shows that OPM considered 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201 as "afford[ing] eligible veterans as much preference as they would receive in competitive examinations," and that the regulation "requires that all candidates be referred in the order of their veterans preference." 52 Fed. Reg. 49,023, 49,023 (1987). If the candidates had received numerical ratings, the appellant would have been placed at the top of the register, but the agency would not have been required to select him. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 332.401 and .402. Rather, the agency would have been permitted to "consider three eligibles in connection with [the] vacancy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 332.402.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, the appellant received as much preference as he would have received in a competitive examination, which is all that is required under Part 333. Because that Part refers to competitive examinations, the "rule of three," on which the administrative judge relied, effectively applies and shows that the appellant was not automatically entitled to the Construction Inspector position, as he contends. Accordingly, we find that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights, and that the administrative judge correctly denied his request for relief under the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a non-attorney position, <span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, 114 MSPR 245, 252-56 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-29, 2010 MSPB 123 (2010), determined that a "tentative selection" by an agency does not avoid the agency's obligation to consider the veteran applicant; the Board also considered the violation of passover procedures that results when a veteran is not properly considered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, even if the cited testimony were credible, a "tentative selection" is insufficient to preempt the appellant's veterans' preference rights; a selection is not operative until it is "official." We find that the agency did not officially select Glover until February 19, 2009, and, accordingly, the appellant's January 30, 2009 application was pending before the agency at the same time as Glover's application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights, including those related to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3317 and 3318, in selecting Glover for the MRT position. Section 3317 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; The Office of Personnel Management shall certify enough names from the top of the appropriate register to permit a nominating or appointing authority who has requested a certificate of eligibles to consider at least three names for appointment to each vacancy in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3318 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; The nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy from the highest three eligibles available for appointment on the certificate furnished under section 3317(a) of this title, unless objection to one or more of the individuals certified is made to, and sustained by, the Office of Personnel Management for proper and adequate reason under regulations prescribed by the Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)(1)&#x2003;&#x2003;If an appointing authority proposes to pass over a preference eligible on a certificate in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible, such authority shall file written reasons with the Office for passing over the preference eligible. The Office shall make the reasons presented by the appointing authority part of the record of the preference eligible and may require the submission of more detailed information from the appointing authority in support of the passing over of the preference eligible. The Office shall determine the sufficiency or insufficiency of the reasons submitted by the appointing authority, taking into account any response received from the preference eligible under paragraph (2) of this subsection. When the Office has completed its review of the proposed passover, it shall send its findings to the appointing authority and to the preference eligible. The appointing authority shall comply with the findings of the Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;A preference eligible not described in paragraph (2) of this subsection, or his representative, shall be entitled, on request, to a copy of--(A) the reasons submitted by the appointing authority in support of the proposed passover, and (B) the findings of the Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, an examining authority is supposed to certify "enough names from the top of the appropriate register" to permit the appointing authority "to consider at least three names for appointment to each vacancy." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). The appointing authority "shall select for appointment to each vacancy from the highest three eligibles available for appointment on the certificate furnished under section 3317(a)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency admittedly did not comply with these provisions because, as previously discussed, it did not believe that it had to comply with Title 5 competitive service veterans' preference requirements in making an appointment to an MRT position and it considered Glover's application alone. This constitutes a violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Endres v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 20 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also violated the pass over process in this case. As set forth above, the relevant statute provides that if an appointing authority "proposes to pass over a preference eligible...in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible, such authority shall file written reasons with [the Office of Personnel Management] for passing over the preference eligible" and obtain the Office of Personnel Management's approval. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see Gingery v. Department of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347, 1352-54 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Endres</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 10. OPM has promulgated a regulation delegating to agencies the authority to adjudicate pass over requests in matters involving 5-point preference eligibles, and 10-point preference eligibles with service-connected disabilities of less than 30 percent, except in a few circumstances that are not applicable here. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.406(a). The agency did not follow the pass over process, which constitutes a separate violation of the veterans' preference rules. The agency was required to comply with these provisions, and all relevant Title 5 veterans' preference statutes and regulations in making the selection at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appeal must be remanded to determine the type of veterans' preference to which the appellant is entitled.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the type of preference to which the appellant is entitled, a remand is warranted. It is undisputed that the appellant is entitled to a 5-point preference, at a minimum. The type of preference is significant because, if the appellant was entitled to a 10-point preference and the agency did not properly credit him, that would be a separate veterans' preference violation. If a veteran is receiving compensation for a disability of 10 percent or more, as the appellant claims that he is, his name ranks above those of others referred for consideration. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313(2); <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 6 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that the appellant did not establish his entitlement to a 10-point preference before the agency because he did not include proof of his entitlement to that preference with his application. However, the administrative judge never informed the appellant that he needed to establish that or how he could do so. The administrative judge also failed to cite any authority supporting his position that the appellant had to submit proof of his 10-point preference eligibility with his application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, the appellant declared under penalty of perjury in a notarized statement that he is a 20 percent service-connected disabled veteran. In his application, the appellant stated that he is a 20 percent disabled veteran and he checked the box claiming a 10-point preference. The application form indicated at the 10-point veterans' preference box that an applicant should "[a]ttach an Application for 10-Point Veterans' Preference (SF 15) and proof required," but it did not indicate what kind of proof. The vacancy announcement requested, among other application materials, a DD 214 and an "SF-15, Application for 10-point Veteran Preference (If Applicable)." It is entirely possible that if the appellant already knew he was eligible for a 10-point preference due to <span id="Page_645"></span>his Department of Veterans Affairs' disability rating, he would not have understood from these documents that he needed to submit another SF-15 to "apply" for that preference again.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its June 1, 2009 letter to DOL VETS, the agency's Chief of Human Resources Service represented that the appellant did not submit proof of entitlement to a 10-point preference. However, it is unclear whether the agency ever contacted him to attempt to obtain this information, when proof of his preference was required, and, given the agency's error in believing that Title 5 provisions did not apply in this matter, whether it mattered to the agency whether his preference was 5 or 10 points. Jones testified that Title 5 veterans' preference rules had nothing to do with this case because Title 38 was completely different than Title 5 and because the appointment at issue was a non-competitive one. Ottem testified that she did not review applications for preference eligibility, even if a DD 214 was submitted, and that veterans' preference was to be considered only if applicants had equal qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook (Handbook) at 85 provides that proof of veterans' preference status is required: (1) "[w]hen such status is used as a basis for accepting an application after the closing date"; (2) "[w]hen positions are restricted to preference eligibles"; or (3) "[p]rior to final selection if the preference eligible was selected over other eligibles based on his or her eligibility for veterans' preference." The first two categories are not applicable in this case. The third indicates that the absence of proof of veterans' preference status at the application stage would not have been fatal to his 10-point preference claim. We note that a separate section of the Handbook addressing incomplete applications indicates that if an applicant does not submit a required form or other material as specified in the job announcement, the agency may rate the application based on the information provided, or may ask the applicant for the missing information, but must apply its option consistently for all applicants. Handbook at 77. The incomplete application section does not address veterans' preference information specifically, except in the context of applicants who are currently on active military duty and do not have a DD 214. For those individuals, the Handbook instructs that "<span class="Italic">[p]</span> <span class="Italic">rior to appointment</span>, you should verify: The eligible's entitlement to veterans' preference...." Handbook at 77 (emphasis supplied). The OPM's VetGuide at 4 indicates that "[a]pplicants claiming 10-point preference must complete Standard Form (SF) 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference, and submit the requested documentation," however it does not state what the "requested documentation" is or when such documentation must be provided. It also fails to address the agency's obligations, if any, to obtain the proper documentation to verify 10-point preference eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we do not have sufficient information in the record before us to determine whether the appellant was entitled to be considered as a 10-point preference eligible by the agency. Therefore, we instruct the administrative judge to take evidence and argument to clarify the issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by not selecting him for another vacant position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by not selecting him for another MRT vacancy. The written record shows as follows: The appellant was rated qualified for an MRT position and referred for consideration to Ottem on March 13, 2009. On or about March 18, 2009, Ottem requested to cancel her request to fill the vacant position and to close vacancy announcement number 08-210. On March 24, 2009, Ottem indicated that the appellant was "not selected," noting he "lack[ed] current coding experience." On April 9, 2009, Jones sent the appellant a letter notifying him that he was qualified for the position and referred for consideration, but not selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ottem testified that she had decided not to fill the second vacancy before she reviewed the appellant's application. Specifically, she testified that she had intended to fill the second vacancy at the GS-4/5 trainee level, but that the person who would have trained the selectee was no longer available to do so. Ottem testified that no one besides Glover was appointed to an MRT position. Hearing CD. The agency's decision to cancel the vacancy announcement before filling the second vacancy was within its authority and did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Thus, the appellant has not shown that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights in canceling the vacancy announcement without appointing a second person to an MRT position.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spigner v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3062), remanded the case to the Board to permit the Air Force to first determine whether 5 CFR 333.201(b) permitted the agency to pass over a 10-point preference eligible to select another preference eligible. The court did not accept the Board's assumption that priority consideration would govern the selection process. Following the judicial remand, the Board sent the case back to the AJ, and, following remand, the Board issued another decision when Mr. Spigner protested his continuing nonselection. The Board determined that the "first preference" called for by 5 CFR 333.201 (2003), for a choice among applicants on an unranked list of eligibles for temporary and term appointments outside a register, required consideration (with articulation of job-related reasons for nonselection) of an individual with a 10% service-connected disability, not selection of that individual, <span class="Italic">Spigner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a disabled veteran entitled to a 10-point veterans' preference, alleged under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights when it did not select him for the temporary position of GS-07 Construction Inspector, but instead selected a 5-point veteran for that position<span class="Italic">.

The Board's administrative judge (AJ) found that the agency was not required to hire the appellant based solely on his 10-point preference<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6; 3. The Board affirmed the initial decision as modified, still denying the appellant's request for relief<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6; 1. The Board found that the AJ applied the wrong law (38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214) and regulation (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401) because the agency used 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201 as its hiring authority to fill the position<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. The Board found that section 333.201 applies to temporary appointments in the competitive service made from a list of candidates who have not received numerical scores and provides that "preference shall be given first to preference eligibles with compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, and second to other preference eligibles." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10. The Board held that the regulation and the statute upon which it was based did not entitle the appellant to selection over a 5-point veteran<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6; 11. Rather, relying on an analogy to the principle of "priority consideration" and the regulatory history of section 333.201, the Board found that the appellant was only entitled to "first preference" for the vacancy<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. Based on the evidence, the Board concluded that the agency gave the appellant a "first preference" and did not violate his veterans' preference rights<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the case, finding that the record did not reflect what the agency would have done had it applied the correct regulation to the correct set of facts and that "[i]t is for the agency to make that determination in the first instance." <span class="Italic">Spigner</span>, 25 Fed.

The court, however, found that it was not clear how the "preference" to which the appellant was entitled under section 333.201(b) should have been awarded<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Thus, the court identified the issue as whether "when one 10-point veteran is listed on an unranked list along with 5-point preference eligibles, and the 10-point veteran meets the minimum qualifications for the position, but one or more of the 5-point preference eligibles may be more qualified, would the agency determine that the 10-point veteran is entitled to the position because he must be given first preference pursuant to &#x00A7; 333.201(b), or does &#x00A7; 333.201(b) permit the agency to pass over the 10-point veteran to select one of the other preference eligibles?" <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand from the court, the Board further remanded the case to the AJ. After receiving additional submissions from the parties, the AJ issued a December 3, 2002 initial decision remanding the case to the agency with instructions that the agency consider the appellant for the temporary Construction Inspector position on the basis of his resume and without referring to the other candidates' qualifications. The AJ found that the agency's interpretation of section 333.201(b), which required only "first consideration" for the appellant, was reasonable, but that the record did not show that the appellant received such consideration before other candidates were referred. The AJ found that the record did not show that the selecting official would have wanted to look at the respective qualifications of the other candidates had he first considered the appellant alone. The AJ therefore held that, if on remand the selecting official determined that the appellant lacks the desired experience, he should set forth with specificity what desired experience was lacking. If, on the other hand, the selecting official determined that the appellant has the necessary experience, the agency should afford the appellant appropriate relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In remanding the case to the agency, the AJ ordered the agency to act in accordance with his instructions, and noted that his "instructions will only become effective...when/if this decision becomes the Board's final decision in this case. If either party or both exercise their respective appeal rights (to either the Board or the Federal Circuit), the agency can delay effecting my remand instructions until a final decision is issued." The AJ noted that, "in the event the appellant disagrees with the action of the <span id="Page_646"></span>selecting official on remand, he may refile this appeal within 30 days of the date that he is informed of the selecting official's actions/reasoning." The AJ then notified the appellant that the initial decision would become final on January 7, 2003, unless he filed a petition for review by that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 6, 2003, Engineering Technician Michael J. Schneider issued a memorandum entitled "Consideration for Construction Inspector, GS-809-07." The memorandum indicated that, in accordance with the AJ's instructions, the appellant had been considered for the Construction Inspector position but was found to "lack the desired experience for this position and will not be selected." The memorandum noted that the purpose of the position was to provide continuing inspection, contract escort, and topside security on construction projects at off-base ICBM missile facilities. The memorandum concluded that the position requires, among other things, the ability to read and interpret blueprints, as well as engineering and architectural plans and specifications, and that the appellant's resume indicated that his work did not provide him with the desired experience in power generation, distribution, lighting, diesel units, fuel distribution, sewage systems, and topography, or with the desired experience with blueprints and engineering and architectural plans and specifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a "Petition for Review or Appeal" with the AJ on March 6, 2003, seeking review of the December 3, 2002 initial decision and challenging Schneider's February 6, 2003 memorandum. The AJ docketed the appellant's challenge to the February 6, 2003 memorandum as a petition for enforcement. On April 30, 2003, the AJ issued a compliance initial decision, denying the appellant's petition for enforcement and forwarding to the Board the appellant's challenge to the December 3, 2002 initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the Clerk of the Board noted that the March 6, 2003 submission constituted an untimely petition for review of the December 3, 2002 initial decision. The Clerk therefore informed the appellant that he could submit an affidavit or a statement signed under penalty of perjury showing good cause for the late filing. In his May 19, 2003 response to the timeliness notice, the appellant asserts that there are two initial decisions at issue in this case: The December 3, 2002 initial decision, and the April 30, 2003 compliance initial decision. The appellant challenges both initial decisions and submits a motion in the form of a declaration to accept the petition for review of the December 3, 2002 initial decision as timely filed or to waive the time limit for filing a petition for review of that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a response to the appellant's submission, the Clerk of the Board has notified the parties that the Board will consider their filings as they relate to both the December 3, 2002 initial decision and the compliance case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We need not, and do not, adjudicate the timeliness of the appellant's petition for review of the December 3, 2002 initial decision because the appellant has shown no error in the AJWs interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201(b) and decision to remand this case for a new determination by the agency.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the December 3, 2002 initial decision provided that he could "refile this appeal" within thirty days of the selecting official's action and that he could therefore wait until after the selecting official took action on remand and decide if he needed to appeal the entire case, including the initial decision and whatever issues were raised as a result of the remand. The appellant contends that any other reading of the initial decision would have resulted in piecemeal appeals that would have wasted the parties' and the Board's resources. The appellant argues, in the alternative, that if the Board finds that his petition for review was untimely filed, the December 3, 2002 initial decision "invited" his error in filing a late petition for review because the initial decision was "arguably unclear and misleading" regarding what the appellant was required to do to file a timely petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it appears that the petition for review is untimely filed with no showing of good cause for the delay, we need not, and do not, resolve that question because we find on the merits, as set forth below, that the AJ correctly interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201(b) and remanded this case to the agency<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Alcantara v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 61 &#x00B6; 3 n.(2001) (not resolving a question as to the timeliness of the petition for review given the Board's determination to deny relief on the merits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that the AJ erroneously interpreted and applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201(b) because the court in <span class="Italic">Spigner</span> "rejected the Board's interpretation and application of the regulation as set forth in the Board's prior adjudication of the Appellant's case." The appellant contends that the language of section 333.201(b) is clear and provides that applicants such as himself must be preferred in hiring, not simply in consideration, over other applicants who do not have the same veterans' preference points. The appellant contends that interpreting section 333.201(b) as the AJ did would provide nothing different for a veteran than the rights already set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401-402<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The appellant argues that "[i]t would make little logical, legal, or linguistic sense to reach a contrary conclusion in that if Section 333.201 were the same as Section 333.401 or 402 there would have been no need to craft Section 333.201(b) at all or in the fashion in which it was crafted." There is, however, no section 333.401 or 402 in the current version of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Therefore, we find that the appellant is referring to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401-.402.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ held in his December 3, 2002 initial decision, we find that the court's remand decision was not a rejection of the Board's legal analysis in its now-vacated final decision. Although noting that the Board's analogy to "priority consideration" rested on a term of art used in another context and not appearing in section 333.201, the court held that it was not clear how the "preference" to which the appellant was entitled under that section should have been awarded to him. The court therefore disagreed with the Board's assumption that it knew what the agency would have done had it known the correct facts and applied the correct regulation, and held that it was up to the agency to make a determination in the first instance<span class="Italic">. Spigner</span>, 25 Fed. Appx. at 865. The court noted the parties' stipulations and held that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201(b) applied in this case, but did not dictate to the agency how it was required to act when making its determination on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, section 333.201(b) provides that, for positions that include the temporary Construction Inspector position in this case, "preference shall be given first to preference eligibles with compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, and second to other preference eligibles."[2] The agency has now made a determination of the effect of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201(b) on the appellant's employment application by setting forth what the agency would have done had it applied the correct regulation to the correct facts. In agreeing with the agency's determination that the regulation only affords the appellant first preference in consideration and permits the agency to pass over the appellant to select another preference eligible, we note that general rules of statutory construction may be used in determining the meaning of regulations<span class="Italic">. Harris v. Department of State</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 514, 517 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 785 F.2d 320 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). Those rules favor consistent interpretation, so that each section of a regulation should be construed in connection with every other section so as to produce a harmonious whole<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Garrett v. Department of Defense</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 394, 396 (1992) (each part of a regulation must be construed, not in isolation, but in conjunction with other parts of the regulation as a whole).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that in an interim rule, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) eliminated 5 C.F.R. part 333, Recruitment and Selection for Temporary and Term Appointments Outside the Register, effective June 13, 2003, based on its conclusion that this hiring authority was obsolete. 68 Fed. Reg. 35,265, 35, 266-68 (June 13, 2003). OPM has since issued a final rule eliminating part 333, effective July 15, 2004. 69 Fed. Reg. 33,271, 33,272 (June 15, 2004). There is, however, a presumption against the retroactive application of a regulation if such application would impair a right a party possessed when he acted. <span class="Italic">Farquhar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 454 &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (1999). Because, as set forth below, the appellant possessed the right of prior consideration in selection for appointment under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 303.201(b) when he applied for the position in question, and the retroactive application of OPM's change to part 333 would impair that right, we will not apply such change in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, when Subpart B of Part 333, entitled "Consideration for Appointment," is construed as a whole, we find that section 333.201(b) affords individuals like the appellant "prior consideration" in selection for appointment, not an entitlement to selection over other candidates. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.203(a), when an agency making an appointment passes over the name of a preference eligible who is entitled to "prior consideration under paragraph (b) of &#x00A7; 333.201" and who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more, and proposes to select a nonpreference eligible, the agency must submit its reasons for so doing to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), notify the preference eligible of the proposed passover, the reasons for it, and his or her right to respond to OPM, and obtain OPM's approval for the proposed passover before selecting the nonpreference eligible. Similarly, when an agency passes over the name of a preference eligible, other than one described in paragraph (a) of section 333.203, who is entitled to "prior consideration" under paragraph (b) of &#x00A7; 333.201, and selects a nonpreference eligible, it must record its reasons for so doing and must furnish a copy of those reasons to the preference eligible and to his or her representative on request. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.203(b). An agency may discontinue consideration of a preference eligible for a position if, on three occasions, the agency has considered the candidate for the position and has either: (1) obtained OPM's approval to pass over his or her name and select a non-preference eligible in accordance with paragraph (a) of section 333.203; or (2) passed over his or her name and recorded its reasons for so doing as provided in paragraph (b) of section 333.203. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.203(c). These provisions all suggest that preference eligibles like the appellant are only entitled to "prior consideration" under <span id="Page_647"></span>section 333.201(b), not entitlement to selection, and may be passed over by agencies in favor of other applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Spigner</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 677 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, the regulatory history of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.201 supports a finding that the appellant was only entitled to "prior consideration" for the vacancy and did not have a right to the job. OPM considered section 333.201 as affording eligible veterans only as much preference as they would receive in competitive examinations<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6; 12. Here, if the candidates had received numerical ratings, the appellant would have been placed at the top of the register, but the agency would not have been required to select him<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. We further note that section 333.201(b)'s first "preference" to preference eligibles with compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more can be contrasted with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 333.202(b), which provides that an agency, when making an appointment from a list on which candidates have received numerical scores, generally "must make its selection" from not more than the highest three names available for appointment in the order provided in section 333.202(a). If OPM had intended for selections under section 333.201(b) to be carried out in the manner described by the appellant, OPM likely would have drafted section 333.201 to more closely resemble the mandatory language of the selection process set forth in section 333.202(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although the appellant asserts that the AJ's interpretation of section 333.201(b) merely duplicates the rights set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401-402, the rights under section 333.201(b) are distinct from those set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401-402. The former section is based on statutes relating to the competitive service and applies specifically to temporary and term appointments in the competitive service, while the latter applies generally to positions in the excepted service<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. Part 333; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant has not provided a basis for disturbing the December 3, 2002 initial decision in this case. His petition for review of that initial decision is therefore DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The AJ correctly denied the appellant's petition for enforcement of the December 3, 2002 initial decision.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ denied the appellant's petition for enforcement of the December 3, 2002 initial decision, finding that the agency on remand considered the appellant for the temporary Construction Inspector position without comparison to other applicants, but did not select him because the appellant lacked desired experience in several areas. The AJ found that Schneider afforded the appellant <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration for the position because: (1) Schneider considered the appellant without comparison or competition with others; (2) Schneider explained why the appellant lacked desired experience; (3) the appellant did not contest Schneider's determination that he lacked the desired experience, and his resume did not list such experience; (4) the position description supported Schneider's determination that the experience that he found lacking was important in performing the essential duties of the position; and (5) Schneider acted consistently with his assertion that the desired experience was important by selecting an individual who had such experience. Having found that the agency complied with the instructions set forth in his December 3, 2002 initial decision, the AJ found that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that Schneider ignored the parties' stipulation that he possessed the minimum qualifications for the position, selected an applicant who had no greater experience than the appellant, and changed the basis on which he decided not to select the appellant, having allegedly indicated in 1999 that he "selected the most qualified individual based on the most experience with construction directly, and/or with construction inspection."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no merit to the appellant's contention that the agency did not comply with the December 3, 2002 initial decision. Schneider based his determination not to select the appellant on a detailed explanation of the appellant's lack of desired experience, a factor that the court recognized could make a difference in this case, <span class="Italic">see Spigner</span>, 25 Fed. Appx. at 865, and that the AJ specifically instructed the agency to consider on remand. We also find that Schneider did not change the basis upon which he decided not to select the appellant. Instead, in response to the AJ's instructions that the agency set forth with specificity what experience the appellant lacked if on remand the selecting official determined that the appellant lacked such experience, Schneider merely provided greater detail in his February 6, 2003 memorandum as to why the appellant lacked the desired experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant argues in his petition for review of the compliance initial decision that the AJ misinterpreted section 333.201(b), the Board has long held that it will not reconsider the merits of a case in the context of a compliance action<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Coffey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 632 &#x00B6; 2 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 10 Fed. Appx. 912 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 129, 131 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we DENY the appellant's petition for review of the April 30, 2003 compliance initial decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit sustained the Board's position and denied relief to the appellant, <span class="Italic">Spigner v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> 143 Fed. Appx. 336, 338-40 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 333.201(b) is titled "Making appointments from an unranked list," and provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In making temporary and term appointments from a list of eligible candidates who have not received numerical scores, an agency shall give preference to preference eligibles as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) For other positions, preference shall be given first to preference eligibles with compensable service connected disability of 10 percent or more, and second to other preference eligibles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the regulation talks in terms of giving "preference" to preference eligibles and states that "preference eligibles with compensable service connected disability of 10 percent or more" must be given preference first. The regulation does not state that 10-point preference eligibles must be hired. Indeed, the surrounding sections in Part 333 explicitly contemplate that the Agency can pass over a first preference eligible as long as the Agency affords the candidate "prior consideration."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 333.203 is entitled "Passing over a preference eligible," and states that "[w]hen an agency making an appointment passes over the name of a preference eligible who is entitled to prior consideration under paragraph (b) of &#x00A7; 333.201...and proposes to select a nonpreference eligible," the agency must, at the least, record its reasons for so doing and provide a copy of the reasons to the preference eligible upon request. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 333.203(a), (b). Moreover, &#x00A7; 333.203(c) contemplates a preference eligible being passed over several times. If a preference eligible given prior consideration can be passed over in favor of a non-preference eligible, then logically a preference eligible given prior consideration can be passed over in favor of another preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spigner argues that consideration of other sections in Part 333 is legal error and that <span class="Italic">Spigner l</span> admonished the Board not to look outside of &#x00A7; 333.201. However, our case law is clear that courts should interpret the regulation as a whole and thus consider sections linked to the section in question. <span class="Italic">See Reflectone, Inc. v. Dalton</span>, 60 F.3d 1572, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (holding that the proper interpretation of the plain language of the regulation "examines and reconciles the text of the entire regulation, not simply isolated sentences"). <span class="Italic">Spigner I</span> acknowledged that it was error for the Agency to rely on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.401, but did not say that the Agency could not look to other sections of Part 333 and construe the regulation as a whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spigner asserts that the text is clear that "preference" means "hiring." Spigner argues that use of the word "selection" in the title to Part 333 and use of the word "appointments" in &#x00A7; 333.201 indicate that the language "preference shall be given first to preference eligibles" requires "selection" or "appointment." However, Spigner takes "selection" and "appointment" out of context. Part 333 in general, and &#x00A7; 333.201(b) in particular, detail processes for making selections or appointments. The text does not equate being given a preference with being selected for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spigner argues that nowhere does the text of &#x00A7; 333.201(b) specify "first consideration." However, &#x00A7; 333.203 expressly refers to a "preference eligible who is entitled to <span class="Italic">prior consideration</span> under paragraph (b) of &#x00A7; 333.201." Because &#x00A7; 333.201(b) states that "preference shall be given <span class="Italic">first</span> to preference eligibles with compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, and <span class="Italic">second</span> to other preference eligibles," prior consideration is first consideration in this instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spigner asserts that this court rejected the Board's interpretation of &#x00A7; 333.201(b) in <span class="Italic">Spigner I</span>. Spigner points to language in <span class="Italic">Spigner I</span> that referred to "priority consideration" as a term of art which was not found in this regulation. However, our reference to "priority consideration" was in response to the Board's citation to <span class="Italic">Langston v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 597, 601 (1999). Because that case dealt with the breach of a settlement agreement provision providing a party with "priority consideration" for available positions, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, and thus did not lend direct support for the Board's interpretation of &#x00A7; 333.201(b), we were hesitant to affirm the Agency's interpretation on that rationale.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spigner argues that the Agency's stipulation that he met the minimum qualifications for the job and its later determination that he lacked the desired experience are inconsistent. However, we see no inconsistency. Spigner may have been minimally qualified, but substantial evidence supports the Agency's determination that because the position was specialized, Spigner lacked the breath and depth of experience that the Agency desired the candidate to possess.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Spigner asserts that if the regulation were interpreted to give him only first consideration, then the benefit that the regulation confers on disabled veterans would be illusory. However, the regulatory history shows that OPM contemplated that the positions covered by Part 333 "often have specialized qualification requirements that should be recognized in the referral process." 52 Fed. Reg. 49,023, 49,023 (Dec. <span id="Page_648"></span>29, 1987). Indeed, OPM struck a balance in promulgating Part 333. The regulation provides "eligible veterans as much preference as they would receive in competitive examinations" and "give[s] agencies greater flexibility in recognizing qualitative differences among candidates." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board instructed the Agency to consider Spigner's resume before looking to any other candidates, make a decision on whether to offer Spigner the job, and if the Agency chose to pass-over Spigner, to provide Spigner with a detailed explanation of why it found Spigner's experience lacking. The Agency considered Spigner and provided that detailed explanation. Substantial evidence supported the Agency's rationale for passing over Spigner. As a result, we do not believe that the benefit to a 10-point preference eligible veteran like Spigner is illusory. Without the preference, Spigner may never have been considered for the position. Although the preference may not result in hiring the preference eligible veteran in all instances, it is OPM's belief that this method struck the balance that Congress intended.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency fills a position under excepted service appointment authority, it may be exempt from advertising the position (meaning that a veteran may not learn of and apply for the job), as in <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Army</span>, 113 MSPR 304, 309-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-18, 2010 MSPB 35 (2010) (aff'd following remand to AJ, <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Army</span>, 494 Fed. Appx. 63 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP)), remanding for factual development and legal analysis a challenged to a Veterans Readjustment Act selection awarded to a veteran but not advertised and unknown to the appellant when the agency was filling the job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that this appeal is within our VEOA jurisdiction, we proceed to the merits of the appellant's request for corrective action. The appellant reasserts on review that the agency violated his rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by appointing an individual from outside its workforce using the VRA appointment authority without announcing the vacancy and permitting preference eligibles and other veterans to apply and be considered for the position. The statute upon which the appellant relies provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce <span id="Page_649"></span>under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency states, and the appellant does not dispute, that the agency filled the vacant Supervisory Operations Officer position by instructing its personnel office to appoint a specific individual outside of its workforce to the position using the VRA appointment authority and that the position was not advertised with a vacancy announcement. A VRA appointment is an excepted-service appointment to a position normally in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.101, 307.103. VRA appointments were first established on April 9, 1970, by Executive Order 11,521, 35 Fed. Reg. 5311 (1970), and are presently authorized by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214. OPM's implementing regulation provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">VRAs are excepted appointments, made without competition, to positions otherwise in the competitive service. The veterans' preference procedures of part 302 of this chapter apply when there are preference eligible candidates being considered for a VRA. <span class="Italic">Qualified covered veterans</span> who were separated <span class="Italic">under honorable conditions</span> may be appointed to any position in the competitive service at grade levels up to and including GS-11 or equivalent, provided they meet the qualification standards for the position. To be eligible for a VRA as a <span class="Italic">covered veteran</span> under paragraph (2) or (3) of the definition of that term in &#x00A7; 307.102, the veteran must be in receipt of the appropriate campaign badge, expeditionary medal, or AFSM [Armed Forces Service Medal] . For purposes of a VRA, any military service is qualifying at the GS-3 level or equivalent. Upon satisfactory completion of 2 years of substantially continuous service, the incumbent's VRA must be converted to a career or career conditional appointment. An individual may receive more than one VRA appointment as long as the individual meets the definition of a <span class="Italic">covered veteran</span> at the time of appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.103. The agency contends that, because the regulation states that "VRAs are excepted appointments, made without competition," it is free to noncompetitively fill a position with an individual from outside its workforce using the VRA appointing authority, without first issuing a vacancy announcement.[3] In other words, the agency contends that it was not required to allow the appellant or anyone else to compete for the Supervisory Operations Officer position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;There is some support for the agency's contention in the regulatory history of section 307.103. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Klamm v. Department of Defense,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 8 (2004) (relying on the history of a regulation as an aid to its interpretation). In issuing its final regulations implementing the Jobs for Veterans Act, which was signed into law on November 7, 2002, and which made a "major change" in the eligibility criteria for obtaining a VRA appointment, OPM indicated that no clarification was necessary regarding whether agencies are required to post vacancy announcements before filling jobs under the VRA authority because "[t]he regulation clearly states that VRAs are excepted appointments made without competition," and that "[a]s a consequence, VRAs do not require public notice as is the case with any appointment in the excepted service," although agencies may advertise for such positions if they choose to do so. 70 Fed. Reg. 72,065, 72,066 (Dec. 1, 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the text of section 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See Wallace v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (statutory construction begins with the language of the statute). The Board has held that all provisions of a statute must be given meaning, and no part should be rendered superfluous or insignificant. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 380, 386 (1994). The language of section 3304(f)(1) provides that when an agency making an announcement accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce <span class="Italic">under merit promotion procedures</span>, it must ensure that preference eligibles and certain other veterans be given an opportunity to compete for the position under such procedures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). However, there is nothing in this language on its face that <span class="Italic">requires</span> agencies to use competitive merit promotion procedures when filling a vacancy, and the Board finds no authority for interpreting it as doing so. <span class="Italic">See VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co.,</span> 917 F.2d 1574, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (where "the language [of the statute] is clear and fits the case, the plain meaning of the statute will be regarded as conclusive"); <span class="Italic">cf. Brandt v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-16 (2006) (holding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) does not require the use of open competitive examination procedures in considering and selecting veterans).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency contends, and the appellant does not dispute, that it filled the Supervisory Operations Officer position using its excepted appointment authority under the VRA. The issue, therefore, is whether the agency properly relied on the VRA to fill the position noncompetitively. <span class="Italic">Cf. Weed,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 14 (the appellant made a viable claim that an agency improperly used a particular hiring authority with a restricted scope of consideration in order to circumvent his right to compete under section 3304(0(1)). If so, then the agency was not required to use competitive merit promotion procedures and section 3304(0(1) was never triggered.[4] However, if the agency was otherwise required to use such merit promotion procedures in filling the Supervisory Operations Officer position, and failed to properly announce the position, then the appellant may be entitled to relief under section 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant appears to argue that permitting the agency to hire a veteran under the VRA without issuing a vacancy announcement undercuts the purpose of section 3304(f)(1). As noted above, however, there is no basis for construing section 3304(f)(1) as mandating that agencies use merit promotion procedures, including issuance of a vacancy announcement, when they otherwise would not be required. Moreover, there is nothing in the legislative history of section 3304(f)(1) to suggest that Congress intended to alter the authority given to agencies under the VRA, which had been in existence for decades, to recruit and hire certain veterans without competition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties were not placed on express notice below that the dispositive issue on the merits is whether the agency was required to use competitive merit promotion procedures and issue a vacancy announcement. Accordingly, the appeal must be remanded for the presentation of additional evidence and argument and the issuance of a new initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Should the AJ conclude that the agency violated the appellant's right to compete for the Supervisory Operations Officer position because it was required under VRA-specific or other applicable rules to use merit promotion procedures and issue a vacancy announcement, an additional issue will have to be briefed. Ordinarily the remedy in a VEOA case such as this is to reconstruct the selection process consistent with law and regulation. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 567, &#x00B6; 11 (2009). Here, there appears to be a conflict in potentially applicable OPM rules. Since the appellant is a non-preference-eligible veteran and the selectee for the Supervisory Operations Officer position is a preference-eligible veteran, according to OPM's rules implementing the VRA the competition would have been administered under 5 C.F.R. part 302 and the individual who was originally selected would have been granted preference over the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.103; Office of Personnel Management <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, "Veterans' Recruitment Appointment (VRA) Authority." On the other hand, according to OPM guidance, the right to compete under section 3304(f)(1) means the right to be considered under merit promotion procedures, which do not include veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 505 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Brandt</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 16. Before ordering reconstruction of the selection process, the AJ should allow the parties to brief the issue of whether any right to compete for a VRA appointment under section 3304(f)(1) arises in the context of 5 C.F.R. part 302 with veterans' preference, or under merit promotion procedures without veterans' preference. We do not resolve this issue at this stage because it has not been briefed by the parties, and because there is no need to resolve the issue if the agency is correct that it was not required to issue a vacancy announcement for the Supervisory Operations Officer position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand the AJ should address additional issues as appropriate, such as the appellant's argument that the Supervisory Operations Officer position was not subject to the VRA. The evidence appears to show that the position was subject to the VRA, but the AJ did not make a finding on the issue in the initial decision under review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may have statutory authority to make appointments without regard to Title 5 provisions, including VEOA. Then the agency appears to have discretion as to how it will weigh veterans preference in appointment decisions. <span class="Italic">Young v. FMCS</span>, 93 MSPR 99, 104 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 9 (2002), determined that the statute authorizing appointments of federal mediators, 29 USC 172(b), permitted the FMCS to make those appointments without regard to civil service laws, interpreted by the Board to include veterans preference provisions of Title 5. The result was that VEOA protections were inapplicable and unavailable to the applicant for a mediator position. The Board relied on 5 CFR 302.101(a) (2002)). That result was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Young v. FMCS</span>, 66 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management explained....:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...Congress has used variable language to describe [the exclusion by statute of positions from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, and in some cases, other provisions as well], ranging from exceptions to the appointing requirements of the competitive service to exclusions from all provisions of title 5. The most commonly used language, however, provides appointing authority for the agency head "without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service" or in some cases "<span class="Italic">without regard to the civil-service laws</span>." Under long-established legal interpretations (currently set out in FPM Chapter 212, Framework of the Federal Civilian Service), "the authority to separate, suspend, or furlough an employee or to reduce the employee's grade or pay is inherent in the power to appoint." In other words, when agencies have the power to appoint <span class="Italic">without regard to the usual competitive or civil service laws, including veterans' preference</span>, this broad authority carries with it the authority to remove (and take adverse actions) without regard to those same laws.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">58 Fed. Reg. 13,192 (Mar. 10, 1993) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 172(b) does not enumerate specific sections of Title 5 to be excluded. The Board determined that "[b]ecause appointments under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 172(b) are made without regard to the civil service laws, such appointments are not subject to the provisions of Title 5." In <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs</span> this court explained that when Congress excludes only certain sections of Title 5 from application, this will not be interpreted to exclude all the protections of Title 5<span class="Italic">. See King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("[S]ection 783(a), the statute under which Briggs was hired, gives the Council the option to employ an Executive Director "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service.... As the text of section 783(a) makes plain, Congress gave the Council the option of disregarding only certain parts of [T]itle 5. To interpret the section as giving the Council the option to disregard additional, unenumerated parts of [T]itle 5 would run afoul of the maxim "<span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>," and in a domain where Congress knows how to exempt a civil service position from the protections found in chapters 75 and 77 of [T]itle 5 if it so desires.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question thus arises of whether Congress, in enacting 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 172(b), excluded <span class="Italic">sub silentio</span> access for preference-eligible veterans seeking specifically excepted positions to the veterans preference provisions of Title 5, including the veterans preference provisions of the VEOA enacted in 1998. The FMCS states in its brief that none of the veterans preference provisions apply, due to the &#x00A7; 172 exclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is relevant that the position Mr. Young seeks is in the "excepted service," and subject to 5 C.F.R. Part 3O2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.101(a) states that the applicability of the veterans preference provisions of Title 5 must be provided by statute for a noncompetitive service position that is not subject to the provisions of Title 5:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 302.101 Positions covered by regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; <span class="Italic">Positions covered</span>. With respect to the application of veteran preference, this part applies to each position in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government that is not in the competitive service and that is subject to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, or subject to a statutory requirement to follow the veteran preference provisions of title 5. With respect to restoration rights that are due to compensable injury and appeals therefrom, this part applies to those positions covered by 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) that are not in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003; <span class="Italic">Positions not covered</span>. This part does not apply to a position or appointment that is required by the Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the Senate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither Mr. Young nor the FMCS cite any statutory requirement to apply the veterans preference provisions of Title 5 in this case, and we know of none. While 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 3320.&#x2003; Excepted service; government of the District of Columbia; selection</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The nominating or appointing authority shall select for appointment to each vacancy in the excepted service in the executive branch and in the government of the District of Columbia from the qualified applicants in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by sections 3308-3318 of this title. This section does not apply to an appointment required by Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the Senate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This section appears as part of Title 5, the laws that were specifically excepted for mediator positions in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 172(b). In addition, the historical and statutory notes to section 3320 state that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This section merely continues, and does not in any way change, the requirements in former section 858 relative to the selection of applicants for positions in the excepted service. Under this section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies having positions in the excepted service will continue to fill those positions in the same manner that they have been filled under former section 858. Such excepted appointments are appointments authorized to be made without regard to the statutes, rules, and regulations governing appointments in the competitive service and this is not changed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government states in its brief that "the regulations implementing the VEOA, moreover, provide that the VEOA does not apply to such an appointment." Although this court held in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 247 F.3d 1222, 1224-25 (Fed. Cir. 2001) that a veteran is not accorded any preference under the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 or the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 when seeking promotion or intra-agency transfers, unless a specific provision entitles him to preference after appointment, that is unrelated to applicability of the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, precedent establishes that excepted service appointments made without regard to competitive service provisions of Title 5, "exclude[ ] the statutory obligations of [T]itle 5 for appointments in the competitive service."[1] While the veterans preference regulations are applicable to some positions in the excepted service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320, Congress has authority to remove certain positions from the scope of otherwise applicable regulations.

While the appellants argue that the words of this statute do not mean that Congress intended to "exempt these temporary appointments" from the "entitlements of Federal employees under the Leave Act provisions of title 5," we conclude that "the plain text of &#x00A7; 5149(b)(1) excludes the statutory obligations of title 5 for appointments in the competitive service."); <span class="Italic">Dodd v.

<p class="Body-Text">The complexities of appointments and VEOA entitlements in VA hybrid Title 38 positions were explored in <span class="Italic">Graves v. VA</span>, 114 MSPR 209, 212-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-18, 2010 MSPB 118 (2010), involving an applicant who maintained that the VA was required to consider his late-filed application as a 20% service-connected disabled veteran. The Board affirmed its jurisdiction and remanded the <span class="Italic">Graves</span> case for additional analysis by the AJ as it noted the complexities of OPM regulations and guidance governing consideration of applicants with veterans preference, including consideration of late applications and retention of applications for a period of time for consideration for pending and future vacancies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that the Board has VEOA jurisdiction over appeals from applicants for hybrid positions under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(3). He incorrectly found, however, that the agency could limit its consideration of such applicants' veterans' preference by handbooks, instructions and guidance, and, in essence, use veterans' preference status as a "tie-breaker" to select between qualified candidates. We find that the agency's use of veterans' preference status as a "tie-breaker" in its selection process is inadequate and that the agency must comply with the competitive service veterans' preference requirements set forth in Title 5 of the United States Code in filling positions under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certain medical positions in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are governed by Title 38. Those positions are identified in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1) through (3). Section (1) covers physicians, dentists, podiatrists, chiropractors, optometrists, registered nurses, physician assistants, and expanded-function dental auxiliaries; section (2) covers scientific and professional personnel such as chemists and microbiologists; and section (3) covers a wide range of other medical positions, including MRTs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions identified in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401 are in the excepted service and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish qualifications for the positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7402(b)(14), 7403(f)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">Carrow v.

No. 108-170, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 301-304, 117 Stat. 2042, 2054-60, was the expansion of the "hybrid" Title 38 personnel system to include several classes of employees that had previously been in the competitive service). By statute, many of the positions are filled "without regard to civil-service requirements." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7403(a)(1), 7405(a). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that Title 5 provisions (the "civil service requirements"), including those regarding veterans' preference rights, do not apply to appointments made "without regard to civil service requirements." <span class="Italic">Scarnati v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 344 F.3d 1246, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (construing 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(a)); <span class="Italic">see also Vores v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 Fed. Appx. 916, 918 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike other VHA medical professionals appointed under Title 38, however, employees in &#x00A7; 7401(3) positions retain many Title 5 rights, including adverse action and reduction-in-force appeal rights. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). Moreover,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]n using such authority to appoint individuals to such positions, the Secretary shall apply the principles of preference for the hiring of veterans and other persons established in subchapter I of chapter 33 of title 5.</p>

"[T]he applicability of the principles of preference referred to in paragraph (2)...shall be resolved under the provisions of title 5 as though such individuals had been appointed under that title." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). In other words, Title 5 competitive service veterans' preference requirements apply to appointments made for 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(3) positions, such as MRTs. Therefore, the agency's policy of using veterans' preference essentially as a tie-breaker for equally qualified applicants is insufficient as it does not provide Title 5 competitive service veterans' preference rights in considering applicants for Title 38 hybrid positions. <span class="Italic">See Marshall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 241, &#x00B6; 6 (2007) (describing some of the Title 5 veterans' preference requirements).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appeal must be remanded to determine whether the agency violated certain of the appellant's veterans' preference rights.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be entitled to relief under VEOA, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency's action violated one or more of his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights in its selection process. <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 199 Fed. Appx. 948 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Here, as noted above, the appellant asserted that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights by improperly refusing to accept his late-filed application. He asserted that he is a 20 percent service-connected disabled veteran, and, thus, the agency was required to receive his application for an MRT position whether the vacancy announcement was open or closed. In support of this contention he cited the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Delegated Examining Operations Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant proved that he is a 10-point preference eligible and that he attempted to submit an application for an MRT position around February 15, 2009, shortly after the vacancy announcement closed. The appellant declared under penalty of perjury that he is a 10-point preference eligible and submitted documentation showing he has a 20 percent military service-connected disability. He also declared under penalty of perjury that around February 15, 2009, he attempted to submit an application for an MRT position, and the record contains an MRT application signed by the appellant and dated February 6, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question remains, however, whether the agency was obligated to accept and consider his late-filed MRT application. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3305(b), OPM "shall hold an examination for a position to which an appointment has been made within the preceding 3 years, on the application of an individual who qualifies as a preference eligible under section 2108(3)(C)-(G) of this title." This includes disabled veterans. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(C). The Board has found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3305(b) is a statute relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Villamarzo v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 8 &#x0026; n.1 (2002). Thus, a violation of that statute can be a basis for a VEOA claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's implementing regulations provide the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A 10-point preference eligible is entitled to file an application at any time for an examination for any position for which OPM maintains a register, for which a register is about to be established, or for which a non-temporary appointment was made in the preceding three years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.311(a). Further, OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, Chapter 4, &#x00A7; A (2007) provides that a 10-point preference eligible may file an application at any time for any position for which (1) a register is about to be established; (2) a non-temporary appointment was made in the preceding 3 years; or (3) a <span class="Italic">list of eligibles</span> currently exists, but is closed to new applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the preference eligible applies for a specific position, meets the qualifications for the position, and is within reach for referral for the position, the examining office must ensure that the preference eligible is referred on the certificate as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If no job announcement is open and you receive a 10-point preference eligible's application, you should establish procedures for handling the application in compliance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3305. You should inform the preference eligible of these procedures as well as the status of his or her application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, Chapter 5, &#x00A7; C. OPM's VetGuide also provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]&#x2003;10-point preference eligible may file a job application with an agency at any time. If the applicant is qualified for positions filled from a register, the agency must add the candidate to the register, even if the register is closed to other applicants. If the applicant is qualified for positions filled through case examining, the agency will ensure that the applicant is referred on a certificate as soon as possible. If there is no immediate opening, the agency must retain the application in a special file for referral on certificates for future vacancies for up to three years....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the above-cited authorities refer to "registers," OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, Chapter 5, &#x00A7; C makes it clear that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3305 and 5 C.F.R. part 332 apply equally to "case examining" hiring procedures, whereby an agency fills a position through a vacancy announcement, as was the case here. <span class="Italic">See Grandberry v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 309, &#x00B6; 15 (2008) (finding that OPM, via its Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, expanded the scope of a similar regulation using the term "register" to include positions filled by agencies under their delegated examining authority). Although the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook states that it applies only to the competitive service, the provisions therein construing veterans' preference statutes and regulations apply equally to the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320 (vacancies in the excepted service shall be filled in the same manner and under the same conditions required for the competitive service by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308-3318); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of Defense</span>, 550 F.3d 1347, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above-cited provisions, at a minimum, the agency should have accepted the appellant's application and followed application-handling procedures that comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3305(b). Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, Chapter 5, &#x00A7; C. According to OPM's VetGuide, this would include referring the appellant on a certificate as soon as possible, and if there was no immediate MRT opening, retaining <span id="Page_651"></span>his application in a special file for up to 3 years for referral on certificates for future vacancies. As we found previously, the appellant proved that he attempted to submit an application for the MRT position around February 15, 2009. Based on the appellant's notarized declaration under penalty of perjury, which the agency has not contested, we further find that the appellant proved that the agency did not accept his application. Accordingly, we find that the agency has violated these veterans' preference requirements and that corrective action is warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It also appears that a "list of eligibles" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. part 332 may have existed but was closed to new applicants at the time the appellant attempted to submit his application. However, further examination and interpretation of the relevant regulation and the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook are necessary on this matter. In the version of OPM's regulation that was applicable when the events in this case occurred, the term "certificate" is defined as a "list of eligibles from a register submitted to an appointing officer so that he may consider the eligibles for appointment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.102(a). On the other hand, although the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook provides that a 10-point preference eligible may apply at any time for any position for which a "list of eligibles" exists, it also states that applications from persons who are entitled to file late should be accepted and processed only up until the time that a "certificate" is issued. It continues that "[o]nce a certificate is issued, however, you should not amend it to include late applications unless requested to do so by the selecting official." Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, Chapter 4, &#x00A7; A. In <span class="Italic">Grandberry</span>, the Board interpreted this provision to mean that an agency should accept and process a 10-point preference eligible's application up until the time that a "certificate" is issued in an action. 108 M.S.P.R. 309, &#x00B6; 15. It did not explain what "certificate" meant in this context, however. The Delegated Examining Operations Handbook Glossary does not contain a definition for "certificate," but it defines "certificate of eligibles" as "[a] list of the highest-ranked eligibles in score and veterans preference order, submitted to a selecting official for appointment consideration in accordance with the competitive selection laws and regulations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not entirely clear that OPM intended "certificate" and "certificate of eligibles" to mean the same thing, but it appears that they are used interchangeably in the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook. If those terms are synonymous, then there is a discrepancy between OPM's regulation and its Handbook regarding whether a "certificate" is merely a "list of eligibles" or a "list of the highest-ranked eligibles in score and veterans preference order." This is significant for multiple reasons. First, this would mean that the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook contains a narrower definition of "certificate" than 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.102(a) does. Second, if a "certificate" is a "list of eligibles," the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook is internally inconsistent, as it provides that a 10-point preference eligible's late application should be accepted if a "list of eligibles" exists, but is closed to new applicants; however, it should not be accepted if a "certificate" has been issued. Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, Chapter 4, &#x00A7; A. Third, in this matter, the "certificate" issued on February 10, 2009 appears to be a list of all qualified applicants, rather than a list of the highest-ranked eligibles in score and veterans' preference order. Thus, the precise definition of "certificate" will govern whether the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights by not adding him to its February 10, 2009 "certificate" and considering him for the MRT vacancies at issue in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly explained, the Board may decide a VEOA appeal on the merits, without a hearing, where there is no genuine dispute of material fact and one party must prevail as a matter of law. S<span class="Italic">ee, e.g., Haasz v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 9 (2008). Here, however, there are genuine disputes of material fact, as well as legal issues to be resolved, which the parties have not had an opportunity to consider or brief. Therefore, we find it appropriate to remand this case for the administrative judge to take further evidence and argument, and, if necessary to hold a hearing, on these issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Graves v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 494 Fed. Appx. 68, 71 (Fed.

Here, in contrast, Mr. Graves filed a timely application for open positions. The agency considered Mr. Graves for at least some of the vacancies for which he applied, so the VetGuide provision did not require the agency to hold his application on file for future vacancies.").</p>
