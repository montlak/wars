<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-109"><span class="space">3.</span> Promotion Records, Appraisals--1995 and Beyond; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">TRACON</span></span> and Public Interest in Disclosure</h4>
<p class="noindent">Through 1995, FLRA decisions authorized the release of performance appraisals under varying circumstances, but in that year FLRA bowed to what it considered to be the intent of the Supreme Court and lower courts. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, New York TRACON, Westbury and NATCA</span>, 50 FLRA 338, 341-50 (1995), a ULP case, determined that unions would not ordinarily obtain copies of unsanitized appraisals of other employees as part of an effort by the union to determine whether given employees were fairly appraised and, if not, what action to take. The test to be applied was a FOIA standard: the union's interest in disclosure would be ascertained in terms of public interest, that is, "the extent to which disclosure of the information would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties or otherwise inform citizens as to 'what their Government is up to.'" The early resolution of grievances was not an appropriate consideration in defining the public interest under FOIA Exemption 6:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central question presented in this case is whether disclosure of the requested unsanitized employee performance appraisals is prohibited by law, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. In asserting that disclosure is prohibited, the Respondent relies on the Privacy Act. As noted above, the Privacy Act generally prohibits the disclosure of records concerning Federal employees without their consent unless, as relevant here, disclosure of the record would be required under the FOIA. For the following reasons, we conclude that disclosure of the requested information is not required under the FOIA and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. Accordingly, without addressing whether the information is necessary, under section 7114(b)(4), we dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory right of an exclusive representative to obtain information, which is expressed as a component of the obligation to bargain in good faith, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b), enables a union to engage in collective bargaining and fulfill its role of representing bargaining unit employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a). In creating this statutory right, it is apparent to us that Congress recognized the significance that information plays in a union's ability to pursue the full range of its representational responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Management</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 884 F.2d 1446, 1449 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Financial Management Service</span>). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1363 (D.C. Cir. 1986) ("[t]he duty to request and supply information is part and parcel of the fundamental duty to bargain"). At the same time, however, Congress established certain constraints on the disclosure of information, including making the prohibition contained in the Privacy Act applicable to union requests for information under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Privacy Act Principles Applicable Under the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In refusing to provide the information requested by the Union in this case, the Respondent asserts that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure because it is not compelled by the FOIA; in particular, the Respondent relies on the FOIA exemption that applies to "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6) (Exemption 6). Under well-settled law, determining whether or not disclosure is required under this exemption involves a balancing of the employee privacy interests that would be jeopardized, and the public interest that would be served, by such disclosure.[5] <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force v. Rose</span>, 425 U.S. 352, 372 (1976); <span class="Italic">Financial Management Service</span>, 884 F.2d at 1451.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Of course, if it is determined that disclosure would implicate no privacy interests, the Privacy Act would not apply and no further <span id="Page_365"></span>analysis under that statute would be necessary. <span class="Italic">For example, National Association of Retired</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees v.

<p class="noindent-1">With respect to employee privacy interests, the disclosure of unsanitized performance appraisals has been the subject of considerable litigation, wherein those interests have been described and weighed under the FOIA. Some of these cases involved requests for information that were made under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, Silver Spring, Maryland</span>, 962 F.2d 1055, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Commerce); United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Regional Office, San Diego, California</span>, 44 FLRA 312, 314 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs);</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and Social Security Administration, Field Operations, Region II</span>, 43 FLRA 164, 166 (1991) (<span class="Italic">SSA Field Operations), rev'd</span>, No. 92-1012 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 10, 1992) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>, mem.). Other cases involved requests for information that were made directly under the FOIA. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Ripskis v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 746 F.2d 1, 3 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>); <span class="Italic">Columbia Packing Co., Inc. v. United States Department of Agriculture</span>, 563 F.2d 495, 498 (1st Cir. 1977) (<span class="Italic">Columbia Packing</span>); <span class="Italic">Church of Scientology v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 816 F. Supp. 1138, 1154-56 (W.D. Tex. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Church</span> <span class="Italic">of Scientology); Gilbey v. Department of the Interior</span>, 1990 WL 174889 (D.D.C. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Gilbey); Celmins v. United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 457 F. Supp. 13, 15 (D.D.C. 1977) (<span class="Italic">Celmins</span>). All of these cases have recognized the personal nature of performance appraisals and the substantial interest that employees have in keeping such information private.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the public interest to be weighed, the Authority is guided by <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> and <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>. In <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, the Supreme Court rejected the Authority's previous approach, which defined the public interest in terms of collective bargaining as embodied in the Statute. The Court held that the only relevant public interest to be considered in the FOIA Exemption 6 balancing analysis is the extent to which disclosure of the information would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties or otherwise inform citizens as to "'what their government is up to.'" <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1013-14 (quoting <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S. at 773). In addition, the Court stated that "all FOIA requesters have an equal, and equally qualified, right to information[.]" 114 S. Ct. at 1014. <span class="Italic">See also Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S. at 771 ("the identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the case before the Court in <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span> involved only the disclosure of bargaining unit employees' home addresses, we find no basis for determining the relevance of an asserted public interest any differently in cases involving other information, including performance appraisals. We note that courts reviewing claims under Exemption 6 of the FOIA consistently have analyzed the public interest utilizing the same definition regardless of differences in the type of information sought. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1060 (names and duty stations of unit employees who received certain performance evaluations) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Horner</span>, 879 F.2d at 879 (names and addresses of Federal annuitants). Accordingly, in balancing the interests under Exemption 6, we will in this and future cases define the public interest in disclosure of information in terms of the extent to which disclosure of the information would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties or otherwise inform citizens as to what their Government "is up to." <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S. at 773.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;As a result, we will no longer follow the analysis in prior Authority decisions that defined the public interest to be weighed under the FOIA in terms of collective bargaining as embodied in the Statute. <span class="Italic">For example, U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Washington, D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 110, 126 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Department of Transportation); U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 46 FLRA 1475, 1485-86 (1993); <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1482 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Center, Louisville Office, Louisville, Kentucky</span>, 45 FLRA 1346, 1352 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Mapping Agency); Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 44 FLRA at 314-15; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, National Aviation Support Facility, Atlantic City Airport, New Jersey</span>, 43 FLRA 191, 201-02 (1991) (<span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Aviation Support Facility</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt this definition of public interest because we conclude that <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span> requires this result for all cases involving the FOIA, including those that have their genesis in a request pursuant to section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. In so doing, however, we acknowledge that applying such a "restrictive definition of the 'public interest in disclosure,'" <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1017 (Justice Ginsburg, concurring), will often deny to Federal sector unions "information their private-sector counterparts routinely receive[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1018. We believe that this result does not serve the public interest in promoting Federal sector collective bargaining identified by Congress in section 7101 of the Statute. The ability to exchange information is central to the labor-management relationship. Moreover, the open sharing of information is crucial to the efforts of Federal labor organizations and management to forge constructive collaborative relationships. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Partnership Council Report to the President, dated January 31, 1994, at 7. Therefore, we encourage labor and management, insofar as legally possible, to accommodate both the privacy interests of employees and their exclusive representatives' acknowledged need for meaningful information. In addition, we recognize that "Congress may correct the disparity [in information disclosable to private sector and Federal sector unions]." <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analytic Framework for Assessing Privacy Act Claims</span> <span class="Italic">Under the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In analyzing cases under the FOIA, it is evident that an agency asserting the Privacy Act as a bar to disclosure is in the best position to articulate the privacy interests of its employees and also to come forward with information that records sought are contained in a system of records. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Vaughn v. Rosen</span>, 484 F.2d 820, 823-24 (D.C. Cir. 1973). This is consistent with the FOIA's requirement that an agency seeking to withhold records must sustain its action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(a)(4)(B). We find that it is appropriate to apply such a requirement to requests under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally Financial Management Service</span>, 884 F.2d at 1457 (Ginsburg, R.B., concurring, noting that section 7114(b)(4) "picks up" the Privacy Act, including the FOIA, "unmodified"). Accordingly, we conclude that in cases where an agency defends a refusal to furnish requested information on the basis that disclosure is prohibited by the Privacy Act because it would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6, the agency bears the burden of demonstrating: (1) that the information requested is contained in a "system of records" under the Privacy Act; (2) that disclosure of the information would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. If the agency makes the requisite showings, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to: (1) identify a public interest that is cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how disclosure of the requested information will serve that public interest.[7] Although the parties bear the burdens set forth above, we will, where appropriate, consider matters that are otherwise apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Of course, the General Counsel bears the overall burden of proving a violation of the Statute; as relevant here, the General Counsel must establish that all of the requirements of section 7114(b)(4) have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the respective interests have been articulated, we will, as we have in the past, balance the privacy interests against the public interest. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 589</span>, 32 FLRA 133, 138 (1988) ("We find that the balancing of interests which is required under the FOIA is appropriate under the Statute."). In striking this balance, we must be mindful that the "clearly unwarranted" language in Exemption 6 weights the scales in favor of disclosure. <span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>, 746 F.2d at 3. At the same time, however, the strength of the privacy interests may not be diminished by a requesting party's assurance that information will not be disseminated or made publicly available because every requester must be treated the same. <span class="Italic">See Department of Defense</span>, discussed above in section A of our analysis.[8] If the privacy interests outweigh the public interest, we will conclude that disclosure of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 of the FOIA and, as a result, that disclosure is prohibited by the Privacy Act. In such a case, disclosure is prohibited by law, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, and the agency is not required to furnish the information unless, of course, disclosure is permitted under another exception to the Privacy Act. On the other hand, if the public interest outweighs the privacy interests, disclosure is not prohibited by the Privacy Act under section 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Therefore, a union's commitment that it will not disclose information will no longer enter into our balancing of privacy and public interests and we will no longer follow our precedent that so holds. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board Professional Association and Merit Systems Protection Board, Washington, D.C.</span>, 30 FLRA 852, 858 (1988); <span class="Italic">Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), Fort Carson, Colorado</span>, 25 FLRA 1060, 1063 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Framework</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, the Respondent does not address whether the requested performance appraisals are contained in a system of records; nevertheless, it is apparent that they are. Section 2429.5 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations permits us to "take official notice of such matters as would be proper." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5. The Authority has found that performance appraisals of Federal employees are contained in a system of records. <span class="Italic">See SSA Field Operations</span>, 43 FLRA at 168-69, <span class="Italic">rev'd as to other matters</span>, No. 92-1012 (D.C. Cir. 1992). We find that it is proper to take official notice of that fact here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_366"></span>In assessing the privacy interests identified by the Respondent, we are guided by the substantial body of law that has been developed, both by the Federal courts and by the Authority....&#8197;Consistent with this precedent, it is clear that bargaining unit employees have significant privacy interests in information that reveals supervisory assessments of their work performance. As the Supreme Court has observed, "Congress' primary purpose in enacting Exemption 6 was to protect individuals from the injury and embarrassment that can result from the unnecessary disclosure of personal information." <span class="Italic">United States Department</span> <span class="Italic">of State v. Washington Post Co.</span>, 456 U.S. 595, 599 (1982). That privacy interest may be heightened with respect to derogatory information in an appraisal, <span class="Italic">Gilbey</span>, but it also extends to disclosure of favorable information that might embarrass an individual or incite jealousy in his or her co-workers. <span class="Italic">See, for example</span>,<span class="Italic"> Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1059; <span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>, 746 F.2d at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, unsanitized performance appraisals reveal details of supervisory assessment of individual work performance and, as such, are likely to contain information that is highly sensitive to employees, which employees may wish to keep confidential. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stern v. Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, 737 F.2d 84, 91 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (addressing employee privacy interest in "diverse bits and pieces of information, both positive and negative, that the government, acting as an employer, has obtained and kept in the employee's personnel file"). We note that unsanitized performance appraisals rarely have been subject to disclosure by courts because of the strong privacy interests of the affected employees. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1060; <span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>, 746 F.2d at 3-4; <span class="Italic">Gilbey;</span> and <span class="Italic">Church of Scientology</span>, 816 F. Supp. at 1156 <span class="Italic">with Columbia Packing</span> and <span class="Italic">Celmins</span>. Indeed, we are unaware of any judicial precedent issued subsequent to <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> in which disclosure of unsanitized employee performance appraisals was mandated under Exemption 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the public interest asserted by the General Counsel, we similarly are guided by precedent recognizing that the public is served if the Respondent carries out its personnel functions fairly, equitably, and in accordance with laws, rules and regulations, <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1060; <span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>, 746 F.2d at 3; <span class="Italic">Core v. United States Postal Service</span>, 730 F.2d 946, 948 (4th Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Core</span>), and otherwise fulfills its statutory and regulatory obligations. The Respondent is engaged in air traffic control activities, which clearly affect aviation safety for the general public. Disclosure of unsanitized performance appraisals would shed light on the ability of employees to perform their air traffic control duties and on the manner in which those duties are performed, which furthers the public interest in knowing how "public servants" are carrying out their Government functions. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Robbins Tire and Rubber</span> <span class="Italic">Co.</span>, 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978) (a basic purpose of the FOIA is to ensure an informed citizenry needed to "hold the governors accountable to the governed").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find, contrary to some of our previous decisions, that the early resolution of grievances is not an appropriate consideration in defining the public interest under FOIA Exemption 6. We reach this result because, pursuant to the principles established in <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>, the early resolution of grievances does not, in and of itself, shed light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties or otherwise inform citizens as to what their Government is up to. Rather, the potential for early grievance resolution arises out of the collective bargaining relationship under the Statute, which, consistent with <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, is not relevant for purposes of defining the public interest under Exemption 6 of the FOIA. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, the court concluded that "[b]y crediting early resolution of potential union grievances,...the Authority improperly loaded the public interest side of the exemption 6 balance with collective bargaining values." 962 F.2d at 1060. Moreover, as the identity of the requester is irrelevant for purposes of analysis under the FOIA, the fact that the Union might use the appraisals to foster the resolution of grievances is of no consequence if it cannot be shown that public access to such information would have a similar result. Accordingly, to the extent that our prior decisions found that the early resolution of grievances is a public interest within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6, we will no longer follow such precedent.[10] <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 44 FLRA at 317; <span class="Italic">SSA Field</span> <span class="Italic">Operations</span>, 43 FLRA at 168.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10] For the same reasons, the proper administration of a collective bargaining agreement would not be a public interest cognizable under FOIA Exemption 6, unless it can be shown that public access would permit assessment of an agency's contract administration, and we will no longer adhere to our precedent that holds to the contrary. <span class="Italic">For example, Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation</span>, 47 FLRA at 126-27; <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 45 FLRA at 1354; <span class="Italic">National Aviation Support Facility</span>, 43 FLRA at 202.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11] Our decisions in these cases applied <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> as an alternative analysis supporting the disclosure of unsanitized performance appraisals. Once the interests that arise purely out of a union's status as exclusive representative under the Statute are eliminated, however, the privacy interests of employees take on more significance relative to whatever public interest remains. Thus, the "substantial" employee privacy interests that were found to exist in <span class="Italic">SSA Field Operations</span> would, when properly balanced against the public interest cognizable under the FOIA, tip in favor of nondisclosure. 43 FLRA at 166. Similarly, the "limited" privacy interests in <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, would, on balance, outweigh the even more limited public interest that is cognizable under the FOIA. 44 FLRA at 318. <span class="Italic">Cf. Halloran v. Veterans Administration</span>, 874 F.2d 315, 322 (5th Cir. 1989) ("even a small and potentially uncertain invasion of privacy engendered by the release of identifying information may nonetheless be 'unwarranted' if there are no public interests supporting disclosure of the particular information").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, our review of the record leads us to conclude that the public interest articulated by the General Counsel and cognizable under Exemption 6 of the FOIA would not be enhanced by the disclosure of appraisals that include names and other identifiers<span class="Italic">. See Ripskis</span>, 746 F.2d at 3-4. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">United States Department of State v. Ray</span>, __U.S.__, 112 S. Ct. 541, 549 (1991) (public interest found to have been adequately served by disclosure of redacted documents); <span class="Italic">Norwood v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 993 F.2d 570 (6th Cir. 1993) (disclosure of documents pertaining to settlement offers of reinstatement to fired air traffic controllers, redacted of identifiers, found to serve the public interest). We note, in this connection, the Respondent's assertion that it had offered to provide sanitized appraisals to the Union. Although disclosure of the <span class="Italic">unsanitized</span> appraisals might assist the Union in performing its representational functions, it is clear, as discussed above, that this interest is specific to the Union and, as such, may not be considered in assessing the public interest under Exemption 6. The General Counsel has not established that the disclosure of employees' names, the precise part of the requested information that implicates employee privacy interests, enhances the public interest in performance appraisals that has been established.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, it appears that disclosure of the requested unsanitized performance appraisals may have adverse consequences. For example, disclosure might "spur unhealthy comparisons" among employees and, thereby, "breed discord in the workplace." <span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>, 746 F.2d at 3. In addition, disclosure could "chill candor in the evaluation process...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That is, supervisors might withhold comments, both positive and negative, from inclusion in appraisals if they were aware that their comments could become known. <span class="Italic">See Gilbey</span>, 1990 WL 174889, slip op. at 2 ("Evaluators who know that their comments may be viewed by members of the general public or become the subject of workplace gossip will, consciously or subconsciously, assess more guardedly and less frankly."). Appraisals that are not forthright provide less guidance to employees in terms of job performance and, as a result, provide less helpful feedback to employees who wish to maintain or improve their levels of performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, and in view of the substantial judicial precedent holding that similar documents are not mandatorily disclosable, we conclude that, on balance, the public interest that would be served by disclosing the requested unsanitized performance appraisals in this case is outweighed by the substantial invasion of employee privacy that would result.[12] Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the unsanitized appraisals would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1060; <span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>, 746 F.2d at 3-4; <span class="Italic">Core</span>, 730 F.2d at 948-49.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12] Although, as noted above, we are not aware of any post-<span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> judicial precedent holding that unsanitized employee performance appraisals are mandatorily disclosable under Exemption 6 of the FOIA, we do not preclude the possibility that particular circumstances may exist in which disclosure of such information would be mandatory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As no other exceptions to the Privacy Act are alleged to apply to this case, we find that disclosure of the requested information is prohibited by law. Therefore, the Respondent is not obligated to provide the Union with the requested information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and its failure to do so is not a violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Summarizing<span class="Italic"> TRACON</span>, <span class="Italic">EEOC and Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 51 FLRA 248, 255-56 (1995), explained why FLRA would not compel the employer to release to the union unsanitized performance ratings, including summaries, supporting documentation, and progress reviews:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the public interest, we agree with the General Counsel that release of the requested information would shed light on Government operations and, therefore, would serve the public interest. Specifically, disclosure of the requested material would permit review of the manner in which the Respondent administers its performance appraisal system. It would also shed light on the ability of employees to perform their duties, which furthers the public interest in knowing how "public servants" are carrying out their Government functions. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Robbins Tire and Rubber Co.</span>, 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978) (a basic purpose of the FOIA is to ensure an informed citizenry needed to "hold the governors accountable to the governed"). <span class="Italic">See also FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 348.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_367"></span>However, our review of the record leads us to conclude that this public interest articulated by the General Counsel and cognizable under Exemption 6 of the FOIA would not be any better served by the disclosure of the name-identified performance ratings, summaries, documents relied on in issuing the ratings, and progress reviews. That is, although there is a public interest in this performance evaluation information, such interest has not been identified in the names connected to those appraisals. <span class="Italic">See, for example, United States Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force, Headquarters, 442nd Fighter Wing (AFRES), Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri and American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 2127</span>, 50 FLRA 455, 460-61 (1995) and cases cited there.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, disclosure of unsanitized information may well enhance the <span class="Italic">Union's</span> ability to use the information to make determinations regarding, for example, potential grievances or the merits of grievances already filed. However, it is clear that these interests are specific to the Union as the requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6.[7] <span class="Italic">See United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 771 (1989) ("[T]he identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request[.]") <span class="Italic">See also Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>, __U.S.__, 114 S. Ct. at 1014 ("[A]ll FOIA requestors have an equal, and equally qualified, right to information[.]"). Moreover, although the public has an interest in determining "if the Respondent is correctly applying the performance appraisal system[,]" the General Counsel has not shown how disclosure of unsanitized performance evaluation information would enhance a member of the public's (as opposed to the Union's) ability to determine whether such programs are administered equitably. <span class="Italic">Cf. Painting and Drywall Work</span> <span class="Italic">Preservation Fund v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 936 F.2d 1300, 1303 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (court found that the possibility that requested information "would facilitate investigation of government efforts to enforce" certain laws constituted a "limited public interest," which was outweighed by individuals' privacy interests in the records).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;For the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, we no longer consider interests embodied in the Statute as a public interest cognizable in our Exemption 6 analysis.</p>

Under that framework, an agency asserting a Privacy Act bar based on a claim that disclosure would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 of the FOIA is required to demonstrate: (1) that the information requested is contained in a "system of records" under the Privacy Act [10]; (2) that disclosure of the information would implicate employee privacy interests, and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy Interests. <span class="Italic">See also Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, New York Region, New York, New York</span>, 52 FLRA 1133, 1139-40 (1997) <span class="Italic">(SSA).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the agency makes the requisite showings, then the burden shifts to the party asserting that disclosure would not result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6--here the Union--to: (1) identify a public interest cognizable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); and (2) demonstrate how disclosure of the requested information will serve that public interest. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 52 FLRA at 1139-40.

In <span class="Italic">TRACON, </span>the Authority stated that evaluation material in the form of unsanitized performance appraisals reveals details of supervisory assessment of individual work performance and, as such, is likely to contain information that is highly sensitive to employees, and that employees are likely to want to keep confidential. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 347 (citing <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Department of Commerce,</span> 962 F.2d 1055, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1992) <span class="Italic">(Commerce);</span> <span class="Italic">Ripskis v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 746 F.2d 1, 3-4 (D.C. Cir. 1984) <span class="Italic">(Ripskis)). </span>Based on this precedent, we conclude that the provision implicates employee privacy interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the provision would serve the public interest by "ensuring that merit promotions are not the product of nepotism or favoritism." The Authority has held, in this connection, that disclosure of employee evaluation material serves the public interest because "the public is served if [an agency] carries out its personnel functions fairly, equitably, and in accordance with laws, rules and regulations[.]" <span class="Italic">TRACON, </span>50 FLRA at 347 (citing <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1060; <span class="Italic">Ripskis, </span>746 F.2d at 3; <span class="Italic">Core v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service, </span>730 F.2d 946, 948 (4th Cir. 1984)). Accordingly, we find that the disclosure required by Provision 6 would serve a public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also held, however, that the public interest served by disclosure of employee evaluative material is not enhanced by disclosure that includes the identities of affected employees. <span class="Italic">See TRACON</span>, 50 FLRA at 349. In so doing, the Authority noted that although disclosure of unsanitized material might enhance <span class="Italic">the union's </span>interest in disclosure, it did not enhance <span class="Italic">the public </span>interest in disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id. See</span> <span class="Italic">also Campbell v. United States Civil Service Commission, </span>539 F.2d 58, 62 (10th Cir. 1976) ("the public interest in efficient and lawful personnel management...is better served by disclosure of general agency performance rather than by specific revelation of individual problems....&#8197;Practically no public interest is advanced by disclosure of the latter.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the public interest outweighs the privacy interest here because: (1) the Union would merely be granted access to the disputed material; and (2) Union officials granted access to the materials would be required to protect the privacy of employees identified in the materials. With regard to the former contention, the Privacy Act protects disclosure of information resulting from mere access to information to the same extent as disclosure resulting from actually furnishing requested records<span class="Italic">. See </span>5 U.S.C. 552a(b) ("[n]o agency <span class="Italic">shall disclose </span>any record which is contained in a system of records[.]") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Wilborn v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 49 F.3d 597, 600 (9th Cir. 1995) ("Under a long line of cases interpreting the Privacy Act, courts have agreed that the Act covers more than the mere physical dissemination of records.")<span class="Italic">. See also Savarese v. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, </span>479 F. Supp. 304, 306 (N.D. Ga. 1979) (the Privacy Act "forbids disclosure of any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the latter contention, in <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 510 U.S. 487 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Defense), </span>the Supreme Court held that determinations whether material may be released to the public under FOIA Exemption 6 are not properly made based on the identity of the requesting party. In this respect, the Court stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Because 'Congress clearly intended' the FOIA 'to give any member of the public as much right to disclosure as one with a special interest [in a particular document],' except in certain cases involving claims of privilege, 'the identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request.'</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 510 U.S. at 496 (citations omitted) (brackets in the original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice v.

Under <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, </span>a party's assurance that it will not further disclose material that has been provided under FOIA Exemption 6 does not render otherwise undisclosable material disclosable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that disclosure of the material required by Provision 6 would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of exemption 6 of the FOIA. As such, disclosure is not required by the FOIA and, in turn, is barred by the Privacy Act. Therefore, by requiring disclosure, Provision 6 is contrary to the Privacy Act. Given this conclusion, we do not address the Union's assertions that Provision 6 is a procedure. A provision that is contrary to law or Government-wide regulation remains so regardless of whether it is a procedure or appropriate arrangement, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1272 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>).</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Office of Justice Programs and AFSCME Local 2830</span>, 50 FLRA 472, 479-81 (1995), followed<span class="Italic"> TRACON</span> and resolved that the employer properly denied the union a list of the names of employees who received outstanding performance appraisals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question before us is whether disclosure of the requested list of names of employees who received outstanding appraisals is prohibited by the Privacy Act.&#x2003;We find that the Respondent has demonstrated that disclosure of the requested information would implicate employee privacy interests.[10] In this regard, the Respondent asserts that the information sought is "almost identical" to that requested in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, in which the court, on review, determined that release of the names of recipients of commendable or outstanding performance ratings implicated those employees' privacy interests. For the reasons discussed more fully in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, we find that employees have substantial privacy interests in keeping confidential information regarding their performance appraisals, even when the appraisals are favorable, such as those involved in this case. <span class="Italic">See Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1059; <span class="Italic">Ripskis v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 746 F.2d 1, 3 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Ripskis</span>). Moreover, disclosure of the names of employees who received outstanding appraisals necessarily would identify (by omission) the employees who did not receive such appraisals and, thereby, also implicate their privacy interests. <span class="Italic">See Commerce</span>, 962 F.2d at 1059.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;The Respondent does not address whether the information is contained in a system of records. However, as we did in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, we find that it is proper to take official notice of the fact that performance appraisals are contained in a system of records. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 346.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our finding that disclosure of the requested information would implicate privacy interests is not altered by the Respondent's alleged previous release of names of employees who received outstanding ratings. Even if the Respondent previously disclosed that information, we are unable to conclude, in the absence of any authority for the argument, that such disclosure diminishes employees' privacy interests in subsequent disclosures....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the record in this case does not establish that disclosure of the requested information--the names of those employees who received outstanding performance ratings--would more than minimally, if at all, serve the public interest cognizable in the Exemption 6 analysis, because it would reveal little about what the Government is "up to." <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989) (<span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>). In this regard, the General Counsel and the Union assert that disclosure of the requested list of names would serve public interests which, if established, would be cognizable under Exemption 6. Specifically, the General Counsel asserts that disclosure would serve the public interest by enabling a member of the public to determine whether "taxpayer dollars" have been wisely spent. The Union posits a public interest in assuring that the Respondent's programs are free from favoritism. We conclude that the General Counsel and the Union have articulated public interests cognizable under Exemption 6 because information permitting a member of the public to monitor agency expenditures of public money and review an agency's administration of personnel programs generally would shed light on Government operations. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 347-48.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, neither the General Counsel nor the Union has established how disclosure of the requested list of names would serve the public interest they articulate in information about the Government's activities. The General Counsel has not explained how disclosure of the requested list would enable a member of the public to determine whether public funds have been wisely spent. Similarly, the Union has not explained how disclosure of the requested list of names would assist the public in determining whether favoritism has occurred. Consequently, the General Counsel has not met its burden of demonstrating how disclosure would serve the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, disclosure of a list of employees who received outstanding appraisals undoubtedly would enhance the Union's ability to determine whether to file an unfair labor practice charge, as noted in its request, or to fulfill other representational responsibilities. However, these interests are specific to the Union as a requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">TRACON</span> precluded the mandatory release of appraisal information used to evaluate candidates for a maintenance foreman position, <span class="Italic">VAMC, Northport and AFGE Local 1843</span>, 51 FLRA 66, 70-74 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that disclosure of the requested information is not required by the FOIA because release of the data would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondent did not violate the Statute by refusing to provide the information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We held in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> [<span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, New York TRACON, Westbury, New York</span>, 50 FLRA 338 (1995)], for reasons fully explained there, that the only relevant public interest to be considered in this context is the extent to which the requested disclosure would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties, or otherwise inform citizens concerning the activities of the Government. More particularly, we held that the public interest in collective bargaining that is embodied in the Statute, or specific to a union in fulfilling its obligations under the Statute, will no longer be considered in our analysis under Exemption 6 of the FOIA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is uncontroverted that the Respondent has already provided the Union with sanitized copies of the information requested, including, among other things, the candidates' applications, the numbers of candidates, the numbers of candidates referred to the Promotion Panel and to the selecting official, and copies of the candidates' qualifications. It is also uncontroverted that: (1) there were only a "few" candidates; (2) the Union's request for copies of appraisals and supervisory-potential forms with the names of supervisors and reviewing officials attached pertained to only two candidates; and (3) the Union stated, in an electronic message, that "anyone familiar with the employee[&#8197;]s and service can deduce who the employees are by their appraisals[,] the same as to who are management officials."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of these facts, and noting that there is no assertion to the contrary, we conclude that disclosure of the supervisors' and other officials' names on the requested performance appraisals and supervisory-potential forms would allow identification of at least the two candidates covered by the Union's request. As such, disclosure of the requested information would effectively require release of unsanitized appraisals for those employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Jacksonville Air Traffic Control Tower, Jacksonville, Florida</span>, 50 FLRA 388, 392 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Jacksonville ATC Tower</span>) (where the information requested included disclosure of redacted material, such as supervisors' names, after sanitized documents had been provided to the union, we found that disclosure of the requested information would effectively require release of unsanitized appraisals for all employees included in the request).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we also find, in agreement with the Respondent, and for reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, that the interest of those two candidates in shielding their individual performance appraisals from public view is substantial. The Union's request requires disclosure of the candidates' appraisals regardless of whether those appraisals are favorable or unfavorable to the candidate. The Authority has determined that disclosure of favorable, as well as unfavorable, information could subject employees to embarrassment and jealousy among co-workers, which could result in discord in the workplace. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs</span>, 50 FLRA 472, 479-80 (1995); <span class="Italic">Jacksonville ATC Tower</span>, 50 FLRA at 393.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As articulated by the General Counsel, the release of the requested information implicates a public interest cognizable under Exemption 6 of the FOIA. In particular, disclosure of the appraisals would permit review of the ways in which the Respondent administers its performance appraisal system. <span class="Italic">See Jacksonville ATC Tower</span>, 50 FLRA at 393.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, our review of the record leads us to conclude that this public interest would not be enhanced by a disclosure of performance appraisals and supervisory-potential forms that includes information which identifies the employees who are appraised. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ripskis v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 746 F.2d 1, 3-4 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (in finding that the agency was justified in deleting names and other personal identifiers from employee evaluation forms, court stated that public interest in forms could "be substantially advanced...short of disclosure of the names...found on the evaluation forms"). <span class="Italic">See also United States Department of State v. Ray</span>, 502 U.S. 164, 178 (1991) (Court concluded that agency properly redacted names and other identifying information from summaries of certain interviews, holding that public interest in the information had "been adequately served by disclosure of the redacted interview summaries" and that the "addition of the redacted identifying information would not shed any additional light on the Government's conduct"). We find, therefore, that the General Counsel has not established that the disclosure of the identifying information involved in this case enhances the public interest articulated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_369"></span>In this connection, by identifying the candidates who are the subject of particular performance appraisals and supervisory-potential forms, disclosure of those appraisals and forms containing the names of supervisors and reviewing officials may well enhance the Union's ability to determine whether the grievance in this case is justified. However, this interest is specific to the Union as the requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S. at 771 ("[T]he identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request[.]"). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1014 ("[A]ll FOIA requesters have an equal, and equally qualified, right to information[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that, on balance, the public interest served by disclosure of the two performance appraisals and supervisory-potential forms including the names of supervisors and reviewing officials is outweighed by the invasion of employees' privacy that would result. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA, and, thus, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. Therefore, the Respondent was not obligated to provide the Union with the requested information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and its failure to do so did not violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">TRACON</span> was extended by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hq., 442nd Fighter Wing (AFRES), Richards-Gebaur AFB and AFGE Local 2127</span>, 50 FLRA 455, 456-61 &#x0026; n.3 (1995), to deny the union an unredacted candidate referral roster used in making a selection for a supervisory vacancy under merit promotion procedures. <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> recapitulated the structure of the Privacy Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act regulates the disclosure of any information contained in an agency "record" within a "system of records," as those terms are defined in the Privacy Act, that is retrieved by reference to an individual's name or some other personal identifier. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(1)(4), (5). With certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent. Section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act provides that the prohibition against disclosure is not applicable if disclosure of the requested information would be required under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552 (FOIA). Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA (Exemption 6) provides, in turn, that information contained in "personnel and medical files and similar files" may be withheld if disclosure of the information would result in a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6). If such an invasion would result, then disclosure is not required by the FOIA. In addition to the exception relating to the FOIA, other exceptions to the Privacy Act may permit disclosure of requested information. However, no other exceptions are asserted to apply in this case....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Air Force</span> explained why the union was not entitled to the information in a form that included employees' names, 50 FLRA at 457-62:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge concluded, in a decision issued prior to <span class="Italic">United States Department of Defense v. FLRA</span>, __U.S.__, 114 S. Ct. 1006 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>), that the Respondent's refusal to furnish the unsanitized referral roster violated the Statute. The Judge determined that disclosure of the information was not barred by the Privacy Act and that the unsanitized candidate referral roster was necessary under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute "for the Union to assess a potential grievance and perform its representational responsibilities[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that disclosure of the requested information is not required by the FOIA because release of the data would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New York TRACON, Westbury, New York</span>, 50 FLRA 338 (1995) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>), which involved the disclosure of performance appraisals of bargaining unit employees, we set forth the analytical approach we will follow in assessing an agency's claims that disclosure of information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6 and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. We stated that an agency asserting that the Privacy Act bars disclosure is required to demonstrate: (1) that the information sought is contained in a "system of records" within the meaning of the Privacy Act; (2) that disclosure would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. If the agency makes the requisite showings, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to: (1) identify a public interest cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how disclosure will serve that public interest. Although the parties bear these burdens, we will, where appropriate, consider matters that are otherwise apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We held in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, for reasons fully explained there, that the only relevant public interest to be considered in this context is the extent to which the requested disclosure would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties, or otherwise inform citizens concerning the activities of the Government. More particularly, we held that the public interest in collective bargaining that is embodied in the Statute, or specific to a union in fulfilling its obligations under the Statute, will no longer be considered in our analysis under Exemption 6 of the FOIA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the relevant interests are established, we will balance the privacy interests of employees against the public interest in disclosure. Where this balance leads us to conclude that the privacy interests are greater than the public interest at stake, we will find that the requested disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 and, therefore, that disclosure is prohibited by law under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute; accordingly, the agency is not required to furnish the information, unless disclosure is permitted under another exception to the Privacy Act. In contrast, where the balance tips the other way, because the public interest is greater than the privacy interests, we will conclude that disclosure would be required under the FOIA and, therefore, is not prohibited by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Respondent has already provided to the Union a copy of the candidate referral roster with employees' names and other personal identifiers deleted. Thus, the question before us is whether disclosure of the deleted names and other personal identifiers is prohibited by the Privacy Act. We note, in this connection, that the Union has requested an unsanitized roster for the purpose of matching those names with other information already contained on the roster. This other information includes candidates' scores in categories encompassing, among other things, performance appraisals and awards....&#8197;Disclosure of the requested information would effectively require release of a complete, unsanitized referral roster.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge made no finding with respect to whether candidate referral rosters are contained in a system of records, it is apparent that they are.[5] In addition, we find that the Respondent has established that the information sought implicates employees' privacy interests. In agreement with the Respondent, we find that employees have a privacy interest in their relative rankings for the disputed vacancy and the other personal information on the roster. Consistent with Authority precedent, these privacy interests are "significant." <span class="Italic">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</span>, 42 FLRA at 1179.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Federal Register 1993 compilation of Privacy Act Issuances states that the Agency includes "merit promotion plan work files" within an Agency system of records identified as the "Personnel Data System." The applicable Agency regulation, AFR 40-335, Section F, provides that a "promotion plan" must include, among other things, a "copy of the ranked roster of eligible competitors (or reference to an established, continuing register)." Moreover, the Authority has found that promotion-related documents, including a list of best-qualified candidates that is analogous to the candidate referral roster at issue in this case, are contained in a system of records from which information is retrieved by the individuals name or some personal identifier. <span class="Italic">E.g., National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 858 and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 42 FLRA 1169, 1176 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</span>). In these circumstances, we find, as we did in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, that it is proper to take official notice of the fact that the requested information is contained in an Agency system of records, within the context of the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 346.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requested information also implicates a public interest cognizable under Exemption 6.&#x2003;In this regard, the referral roster contains each candidate's name and overall ranking for the supervisory position in question and the candidate's scores in various components of the overall ranking, including performance appraisals and awards. Thus, disclosure of the roster would reveal a candidate's qualifications for promotion, how each candidate was ranked under the Respondent's merit promotion plan, and how the person selected for the supervisory position compared with other candidates. Disclosure of the roster would, thereby, shed light on whether the Respondent made a selection for the supervisory position on the basis of merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, our review of the record leads us to conclude that the aforementioned public interest cognizable under Exemption 6 would not be enhanced by disclosure of the portion of the information withheld by the Respondent--the names and other personal identifiers of applicants for a vacancy. That is, although there is a public interest in the roster, such interest has not been identified in disclosure of the names and other personal identifiers on the roster. <span class="Italic">See Ripskis v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 746 F.2d 1, 3-4 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (in finding that agency was justified in deleting names and other personal identifiers from employee evaluation forms, court stated that public interest in forms could "be substantially advanced...short of disclosure of the names...found on the evaluation forms"). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of State v.

<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, disclosure of the referral roster, with the applicants' names and other personal identifiers included, may well enhance the Union's ability to determine whether a grievance is justified. However, this interest is specific to the Union as the requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6. Similarly, although the Judge found that the public interest embodied in the Statute outweighed employee privacy interests, we no longer consider interests embodied in the Statute as a public interest cognizable under the FOIA in determining whether information is disclosable. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 344 n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that, on balance, the public interest served by disclosure is outweighed by the invasion of employees' privacy that would result. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA, and, thus, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. Therefore, the Respondent was not obligated to provide the Union with the requested information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and its failure to do so did not violate the Statute.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Although the General Counsel notes that <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span> did not address the "potential applicability" of the "routine use" exemption to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3), the General Counsel makes no assertion that the requested information may be released pursuant to a routine use. Accordingly, we do not address that issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Privacy Act does not bar information that clearly does not fall within the Act, e.g., questions used by panel members to rank candidates. Records subject to the Act must be tied to an individual and retrievable by the name or other identifier tied to that individual. A request for a list of questions is not precluded by the Privacy Act; the information does not pertain to or identify any individual employee. <span class="Italic">DOD, Maxwell AFB and AFGE Local 997</span>, 36 FLRA 110, 111 (1990).</p>
