<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-109"><span class="space">3.</span> Judicial Estoppel</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Another doctrine of issue preclusion, judicial estoppel, prevents an appellant from arguing a position in one case, receiving a favorable result based on the position, and then in another case arguing a position contrary to that argued in the first. From the Third Circuit, definition of judicial estoppel was offered in <span class="Italic">Semper v. Gomez</span>, 747 F.3d 229, 247 (3d Cir. 2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Judicial estoppel is a fact-specific, equitable doctrine, applied at courts' discretion." <span class="Italic">In re Kane</span>, 628 F.3d 631, 638 (3d Cir. 2010). It rests on the basic notion that, "'absent any good explanation, a party should not be allowed to gain an advantage by litigation on one theory, and then <span class="Italic">seek</span> an inconsistent advantage by pursuing an incompatible theory.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Krystal Cadillac-Oldsmobile GMC Truck, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp</span>., 337 F.3d 214, 319-20 (3d Cir. 2003)); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., id.</span> (noting that several criteria guide application of judicial estoppel doctrine, i.e., whether two positions are irreconcilably inconsistent, whether the party changed position in bad faith, whether relief is tailored to address harm and no lesser sanction would suffice as remedy, and whether party is provided with opportunity to offer explanation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellees appropriately note that judicial estoppel cannot be used to create subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Erie Ins. Exch. v. Erie Indemn. Co</span>., 722 F.3d 154, 162-63 (3d Cir. 2013). Likewise, such jurisdictional defects may be raised at any time (and, in fact, must be raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Frett-Smith v. Vanterpool</span>, 511 F.3d 396, 399 n.3 (3d Cir. 2008)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 680 Fed. Appx. 961, 966-67 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), involved an appeal based on a due process error first suggested by the court, resulting in a reversal of a removal, followed by another removal presenting no due process error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Judicial estoppel "prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase." <span class="Italic">Pegram v. Herdrich</span>, 530 U.S. 211, 227 n.8 (2000). Although the circumstances for invoking judicial estoppel cannot be "reduc[ed] to any general formulation of principle," <span class="Italic">New Hampshire v. Maine</span>, 532 U.S. 742, 750 (2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Allen v. Zurich Ins</span>., 667 F.2d 1162, 1166 (4th Cir. 1982)), the Supreme Court has articulated several factors to guide us in determining whether to apply it in a particular case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">First, a party's later position must be "clearly inconsistent" with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create "the perception that either the first or the second court was misled[.] "...A third consideration is whether the party <span class="Italic">see</span>king to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 750-51 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the first factor, it is not clear how the Air Force's position in the first removal proceeding--that a remand was warranted in light of <span class="Italic">Ward</span>--is inconsistent with the Air Force's second, constitutionally correct removal proceeding. The Air Force pursued the same four charges and aggravating factor in both proceedings, with the proper constitutional procedure serving as the only pertinent difference between them. In addition, contrary to Mr. Howard's contention, the Air Force never stated or implicitly admitted that it would not have removed Mr. Howard in the first proceeding absent consideration of his poor performance. With respect to the second factor, our court never addressed whether removal was appropriate in the first removal proceeding. Accordingly, the Air Force did not "succeed[ ] in persuading" this court to accept its position on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 750.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, under the third factor, Mr. Howard contends that the Air Force derived an unfair advantage from its inconsistent positions because it was permitted to initiate a second removal proceeding. Initiating a new removal proceeding to remedy a procedural error does not confer on the Air Force an "unfair advantage." Nor does it impose on Mr. Howard an "unfair detriment." Indeed, our decision in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>--the case that precipitated the remand in the first removal proceeding--explicitly envisions that an agency would follow the very steps taken by the Air Force here: "If the Board finds that [there was a] violation of Ward's due process rights, Ward must be afforded a 'constitutionally correct removal procedure.'" <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 (quoting <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377). Following our directive in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and remedying the constitutional violation did not provide the Air Force with an unfair advantage. In sum, Mr. Howard has failed to convince us that judicial estoppel applies in this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we agree with the appellant that the agency should be judicially estopped from advancing this argument at this stage of the appeal. "Judicial estoppel generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase." <span class="Italic">Pegram v. Herdrich</span>, 530 U.S. 211, 227 n.8 (2000); <span class="Italic">see Data General Corp. v. Johnson</span>, 78 F.3d 1556, 1565 (1996) (observing that a tribunal may judicially estop a party from arguing a position contrary to one that it successfully argued in an earlier proceeding). The decision of whether to apply judicial estoppel lies within the discretion of the adjudicating court or administrative agency. <span class="Italic">See Data General Corp</span>., 78 F.3d at 1565. Although the test for judicial estoppel is "not reducible to any general formulation of principle," the U.S. Supreme Court has identified three factors that are generally relevant: (1) a party's later position must be clearly inconsistent with the same party's prior position; (2) in the earlier proceeding, the party was successful in persuading the adjudicating body of its position, such that "judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create 'the perception that either the first or the second court was misled'"; and (3) "the party <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped." <span class="Italic">New Hampshire v. Maine</span>, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51 (2001) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">Kavaliauskas v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 9 (2014).

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Tompkins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 529, 530-33 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9 (1999), the appellant argued that he was constructively removed based on agency misinformation after he successfully argued in another case that he was entitled to continuation of a disability annuity. The result he achieved in the retirement appeal judicially estopped him from challenging his separation from the service as a constructive removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is an adverse action appeal in which the appellant alleged that his retirement on disability in 1975 constituted a removal action because it was the result of agency misinformation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal was filed after the appellant received an adverse initial decision in a related appeal, <span class="Italic">Tompkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 MSPR 400 (1996) (the retirement appeal). The retirement appeal concerned the action of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) which terminated the appellant's disability retirement benefits in 1994 on the basis that he no longer suffered from schizophrenia. The appellant challenged that action, contending that he had never suffered from schizophrenia, and that his application for disability retirement had been based on a knee condition. The Board found that: (1) the appellant filed the disability retirement application on the basis of a knee condition and believed that this had been the basis on which disability benefits were approved; (2) OPM's predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, had approved disability benefits on the basis of a mental condition; (3) the determination by the Civil Service Commission of a disabling mental condition was not binding on the appellant, but the appellant was not entitled to reinstatement of his disability retirement on the basis of his knee condition because no administrative agency had ever found that he was disabled on that basis; and (4) the appeal must be remanded to OPM for a determination of whether the appellant was entitled to disability retirement in 1975 on the basis of his knee condition. <span class="Italic">Tompkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 MSPR 400 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a footnote in its decision in the retirement appeal, the Board observed that a favorable decision by OPM would in all likelihood render moot the second-filed adverse action appeal against the Department of the Navy. 72 MSPR at 403 n.2. The Board stated that it therefore would hold the adverse action appeal in abeyance pending the outcome of the retirement appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, OPM found that the appellant was not entitled to disability retirement on the basis of a knee condition. In an initial decision dated December 15, 1997, however, an administrative judge, having found that the appellant "met his burden of proving that he was entitled to disability retirement in 1974 because of his knee condition," ordered OPM "to grant the appellant's application for disability retirement filed June 1, 1974." <span class="Italic">Tompkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 MSPR 400. This decision became the Board's final decision when the deadline for petitioning the Board for review passed without a petition being filed<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of judicial estoppel...bars the appellant from now <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing relief from an alleged constructive removal. Judicial estoppel preserves the integrity of the judicial process by precluding a party from contradicting a tribunal's determination in another proceeding when the determination was based on the position taken by the party in that case. <span class="Italic">Teledyne Industries, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board,</span> 911 F.2d 1214, 1217-18 &#x0026; n.3 (6th Cir. 1990). The doctrine is one that is appropriately applied to decisions in administrative adjudications, <span class="Italic">cf. Chaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co.,</span> 11 F.3d 1420, 1427 (7th Cir. 1993), and it is plainly applicable here. The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Tompkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span> accepted the appellant's contention that he was physically unable to perform his duties and entitled to retire on disability at the time of his separation. As a result, that decision bars the appellant from making the contrary contention in this case that his separation was due to agency misinformation and should be reversed as a constructive removal. Because the appellant has sought and obtained a decision that he was entitled to be retired on disability, he is judicially estopped from contending this retirement was a constructive removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The object of an adverse action appeal is necessarily to undo the adverse action--in this instance, the appellant's alleged removal by the Department of the Navy. If successful in this appeal, the appellant's remedy would be reinstatement to employment at the Department of the Navy. Such employment is obviously and inherently inconsistent with receiving a disability retirement annuity. Until the appellant's retirement appeal was resolved, he could plead in the alternative that his retirement on disability constituted a removal action. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(e) (permitting a party to plead as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency). Now that there is a final decision determining that the appellant is entitled to, and must be awarded, disability retirement benefits, he can no longer maintain a claim that his disability retirement constituted an unwarranted removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The relation of a disability retirement determination and an adverse action appeal was also explored in <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 648, 655, 661 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17, 30 (1999), declaring that appeals would be examined on a case-by-case basis to ascertain whether a disability retirement determination, requiring an agency certification that no accommodation was possible, bars an adverse action appeal based on a claim of disability discrimination. Of judicial estoppel, <span class="Italic">Lamberson</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine which is used by courts to "bar[ ] a party from adopting inconsistent positions in the same or related litigation." <span class="Italic">United States v. 49.01 Acres of Land</span>, 802 F.2d 387, 390 (10th Cir. 1986). As at least one court has stated, it is inappropriate to apply judicial estoppel to statements made in the context of an application for disability benefits under the Social Security Act (SSA) because to do so would supplant the truth-<span class="Italic">seek</span>ing function of the court "by an agency administrative decision rendered without an evidentiary hearing."<span class="Italic">Griffith v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc</span>., 135 F.3d 376, 382 (6th Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there was no litigation surrounding the appellant's application for disability benefits, and thus no prior proceedings before either the Board or a court on the issue of whether she could perform her position with accommodation. Thus, applying judicial estoppel to OPM's administrative decision to award the appellant a disability benefit would, as stated above, arguably supplant the Board's function of determining, in a fully litigated appeal of the agency's removal action, whether the appellant could have been accommodated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arellanes v. DOD</span>, DE-0752-15-0021-C-1 (NP 2/21/2023) (Vice Chairman Harris concurring and dissenting in part) (OPM disability retirement grant did not judicially estop appellant from arguing that he was ready, willing, and able to return to work and that he should be reinstated with back pay; the issue of appellant's entitlement to disability benefits was not litigated before the Board, citing <span class="Italic">Lamberson,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>.). [<span class="Italic">Lamberson</span> is discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-156.html#sec6-155">Allegation of Disability Discrimination, Lack of Reasonable Accommodation</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bencomo v. DHS</span>, 115 MSPR 621, 623-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10, 2011 MSPB 22 (2011), resolved that judicial estoppel was unavailing to an appellant removed for misconduct as a criminal investigator when a civil action involving the appellant's actions was based on different legal claims and an analysis that did not parallel the adverse action appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review that the administrative judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss several of the charges against him under the doctrine of judicial estoppel. Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that is used by courts to bar one party from adopting inconsistent positions in the same or related litigation. <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 648, &#x00B6; 16 (1999). Here, the appellant asserts that the agency took a position in this appeal that was inconsistent with the position the Department of Justice took in defending a civil suit in <span class="Italic">Padilla v. United States</span>, 2007 WL 2409792 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 20, 2007), brought in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and under <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,</span> 403 U.S. 388 (1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge should have applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel to the first three charges. Judicial estoppel preserves the integrity of the judicial process by precluding a party from contradicting a tribunal's determination in another proceeding when the determination was based on the position taken by the party in that case. <span class="Italic">Tompkins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (citing<span class="Italic"> Teledyne Industries, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 911 F.2d 1214, 1217-18 &#x0026; n.3 (6th Cir. 1990)). Under that doctrine,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[w]here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">New Hampshire v. Maine</span>, 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001). The appellant specifically argues that the agency took the position in the civil suit that the appellant violated no agency rules or regulations in connection with SA-913-EP, <span id="Page_1543"></span>and then charged the appellant with misconduct in connection with the same confidential informant. The agency argues that its position in the civil suit was not clearly inconsistent with its position with respect to the first three charges in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the civil suit, the estates and relatives of six decedents sought relief from the United States for murders committed by a Mexican drug cartel.[*] <span class="Italic">Padilla</span>, 2007 WL 2409792. The plaintiffs alleged that, despite knowledge that SA-913-EP participated in a murder in August 2003, the defendants allowed him to continue operating as a confidential informant. The plaintiffs further alleged that SA-913-EP was subsequently involved in at least 12 other murders. <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] The plaintiffs sought to hold several federal employees (including the appellant) individually liable under <span class="Italic">Bivens</span>. <span class="Italic">Padilla</span>, 2007 WL 2409792. However, because a <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim can result only in liability against individual defendants, rather than the government itself, <span class="Italic">see Brown v. United States</span>, 105 F.3d 621, 624 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the government was not required to defend against those claims. We therefore do not believe that the agency can properly be estopped from taking a position inconsistent with one taken by the defendants with respect to the <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claims. <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government moved to dismiss the appeal or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The government argued that the court lacked jurisdiction under the foreign country and discretionary function exceptions to the FTCA. The government further argued that the plaintiffs failed to establish that it or its employees owed a duty to the decedents under Texas negligence law, or that the employees breached any such duty. The court adopted each of the government's positions and dismissed the claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not believe that the agency's position in the civil suit should preclude it from bringing the first three charges against the appellant. The dismissal of the civil action was not based on a determination that the appellant's actions were proper. Instead, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to establish that the agency owed a duty of care to the decedents, or that any alleged negligence by agency employees (including the appellant) was the cause in fact of the decedents' deaths. Therefore, the agency's position in the present case that the appellant acted improperly is not inconsistent with the position taken by the government and adopted by the court in the civil suit. Rather, before the Board, the agency charged the appellant with making false statements, failing to follow supervisory instructions, and negligently performing his duties by failing to timely inform agency management of the confidential informant's misconduct after the murders. After carefully considering the record, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the government took any position before the district court that is factually or legally inconsistent with the position that it has taken before the Board, and we, therefore, conclude the administrative judge made no error in denying the appellant's motion to dismiss.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The relation of a pretrial diversion agreement in a criminal proceeding, likened by the Board to a settlement agreement, and the application of judicial estoppel in an adverse action appeal, was explored by <span class="Italic">Kavaliauskas v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 120 MSPR 509, 514-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, 2014 MSPB 4 (2014), concluding that the agreement did not preclude the appellant from challenging an adverse action based on the facts leading to the diversion agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judicial estoppel preserves the integrity of the judicial process by precluding a party from contradicting a tribunal's determination in another proceeding when the determination was based on the position taken by the party in that case.<span class="Italic"> Tompkins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (holding further that application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel to administrative adjudications is appropriate). While there is no single test for determining if judicial estoppel applies to a proceeding, "several factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case": (1) a later position must be clearly inconsistent with the same party's prior position; (2) the party was successful in the earlier proceeding in persuading the court of its position, such that "judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create 'the perception that either the first or the second court was misled'"; and (3) "the party <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped." <span class="Italic">New Hampshire v. Maine</span>, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a prior action was settled, judicial estoppel does not bar parties from later taking inconsistent positions to those asserted in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Water Technologies Corp. v. Calco, Ltd.</span>, 850 F.2d 660, 665-66 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). The purpose of judicial estoppel, to preserve the integrity of the courts, is not implicated when the action ends in settlement without a disposition by the court because there is no judicial acceptance of the party's prior position.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 666.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pretrial diversion agreement is akin to a settlement, and therefore judicial estoppel does not apply. As discussed above, it does not appear that the criminal case was ever docketed, and the agreement was not signed by a judge. There is no evidence that a court accepted either party's position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the agreement does not reflect that either party "won" the matter, but rather that the interests of both parties (not just the appellant's interests) were served by the agreement. Under these circumstances, we decline to give the pretrial agreement preclusive effect.</p>
