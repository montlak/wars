<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-11"><span class="space">d.</span> Discovery in Furlough Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chandler v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 120 MSPR 163, 2013 MSPB 74 (2013), on interlocutory appeal, an early decision arising from the large group of furlough appeals in 2013 resulting from budget sequestration, defined the permissible scope of discovery, generally limited to an examination of the fairness of the application of the furlough rather than the exercise of agency discretion and financial analysis in the furlough implementation. There were divergent views <span id="Page_3011"></span>between the Board's Chairman and Vice Chairman concerning the scope of the Board's proper analysis. Readers should review the Vice Chairman's separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part as well as the separate concurring opinion of Chairman Grundmann.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allowed were discovery requests involving use of overtime during a furlough; whether nonbargaining unit employees were identified for or subject to furlough; payment of bonuses after the sequestration order to determine if money was paid to some employees to compensate them for income lost by the furlough; whether procedures were followed that were required by statute and the agency's operating instructions; the content of any Executive Order directing the agency to conduct a furlough.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disallowed were discovery requests concerning the hiring of new employees; budgetary considerations and the costs of implementing the furlough; the status of union bargaining initiatives pertaining to the furlough; whether some employees were allowed greater flexibility than others in scheduling their furlough days; information about the hiring of contract employees after the announcement of the furlough, without a showing that those employees had any functional relationship with the appellant; information under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> concerning penalty determinations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chandler</span> enumerated the permissible discovery requests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 1</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In request 1, the appellant seeks "[a]ll records, discussion papers, documentation, e-mail, fax, post-it notes, etc." related to employees who have been hired and employees paid overtime since the time the agency announced its intention to conduct a furlough. According to the appellant, this information is relevant because it does not promote the efficiency of the service to furlough experienced employees in order to reduce costs and then hire new employees, which adds to costs, and it is not fair to furlough some employees and provide others with overtime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied this request, finding that it "concern[s] management considerations underlying the agency's exercise of its discretion in determining whether the cost savings should be applied to personnel costs and how much should be applied to other expenses. The administrative judge found that such matters are not subject to Board review. We agree with the administrative judge's determination as to matters related to hiring new employees, but we disagree with her as to matters related to payment of overtime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 6</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Request 6 seeks information related to nonbargaining unit employees who were not identified for or subjected to the furlough, or who had an option to take different days off, or were allowed to work overtime during the period from the first furlough day to the last. The appellant argues that this information is necessary to determine whether the furloughs were conducted in a fair and even manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the information concerning other agency employees not subject to the furlough was discoverable but that the information concerning whether other employees had the option to take different days or work overtime was not discoverable. As discussed above, a furlough must be conducted in a uniform and consistent manner, and we therefore agree that the length of the furlough imposed on similarly situated employees is relevant. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. at 225; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(2). We also find, for the reasons explained in connection with discovery request 1, that information regarding overtime payments may be relevant to this determination. We therefore disagree with the administrative judge, and we find that this information is discoverable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 10</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Request 10 seeks information related to the amount of bonuses and awards paid to management officials from October 1, 2012, to the present. The appellant explains that such information is relevant because it would not be fair and even if agency managers were given awards to make up for salaries lost during the furlough. The administrative judge denied request 10, finding that it sought information underlying management's exercise of its discretion regarding whether cost savings should be assigned to personnel or to other expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we agree with the appellant that information about whether some agency employees were afforded bonuses for the purpose of compensating them for income lost by the furlough would be relevant to whether the furlough was uniformly and consistently implemented. Thus, information about bonuses is subject to discovery by the appellant. However, because the Presidential Order regarding sequestration was not issued until March 1, 2013, and the agency did not propose furloughing the appellant until April 22, 2013, we find that the relevant time period for this request began no earlier than March 1, 2013. Request 10 is GRANTED for the time period beginning on March 1, 2013.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 13</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Request 13 seeks information related to "how [the agency] followed the adverse action/oral reply process in applying the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and/or [Internal Revenue Manual]. The appellant argues that this information is vital because "[t]he process of how a furlough is done can be just as important as the deciding factors to implement such an action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge granted this request in part and denied it in part. She found that the factors for assessing the reasonableness of a penalty articulated by the Board in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06, do not apply to furlough appeals.[7] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge therefore concluded that the requested information about the application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The administrative judge further found, however, that the appellant is entitled to information regarding "the specific process under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 that the agency applied when implementing the action against her."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The administrative judge noted that, although <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor 6, the consistency of the penalty, may arguably apply to furloughs, it is encompassed within the issue of whether the agency administered the furlough uniformly and consistently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that, because furloughs are not disciplinary in nature, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402, the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are not applicable to an agency's decision in a furlough appeal. As noted by the administrative judge, this is consistent with other nondisciplinary matters where the Board does not apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 769 F.2d 1558, 1566-67 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Accordingly, any information about the application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to the appellant's furlough would not be relevant or likely to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence, and the administrative judge properly denied it. However, we also agree with the administrative judge that information regarding the specific process under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 applied by the agency would be relevant to issues of due process and harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2). Request 13 is therefore GRANTED as to the specific processes that the agency applied under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 and the Internal Revenue Manual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 14</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In request 14, the appellant seeks information related to an Executive Order directing the IRS to conduct a furlough of its employees. The administrative judge ordered the agency to produce, if it exists, the Executive Order directing IRS to conduct a furlough, but she directed the appellant to provide a further explanation of the remaining information requested so as to allow her to make a determination of the propriety of the request. We agree with the administrative judge's determination. Request 14 is GRANTED as to any Executive Order directing the IRS to conduct a furlough. As to the remainder of the appellant's request, we refer this matter back to the administrative judge to rule on in the first instance in light of this Opinion and Order and any additional explanation that the appellant provides.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chandler</span> enumerated the impermissible discovery requests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 1</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the information regarding the hiring of new employees, we find that this pertains solely to spending matters within the agency's sound discretion, i.e., whether the agency could have made different spending decisions to avoid or lessen the furloughs. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 570. It is therefore irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to relevant evidence. Although the agency's alleged decision to award certain employees overtime may be characterized as a spending decision as well, we find that it might also be relevant to whether the agency applied the furlough uniformly and consistently. Specifically, if the agency used overtime payments to relieve certain employees but not others of the financial consequences of the furlough, this may be sufficient to show that the furlough did not meet the efficiency of the service standard....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 2</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Request 2 seeks information related to the cost of conducting the furlough, including mailings, travel, overtime, staff hours, and other direct and indirect costs related to conducting the furlough. The appellant argues that information on the cost of implementing the furlough is necessary to determine whether the furlough promotes the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied this request as well, also on the basis that it concerns spending matters within the agency's sound discretion. We agree. The wisdom of the agency's spending decisions is not at issue. Request 2 is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 3</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Request 3 seeks information related to the agency's decision to proceed with the furlough while in the midst of bargaining with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), the exclusive representative of IRS <span id="Page_3012"></span>employees. The appellant argues that an understanding of why the adverse action was taken even though the appellant's representative was negotiating over the furlough is relevant to whether the furlough promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied request 3 on the basis that the agency's negotiations with the NTEU are not relevant to the pending issues before the Board. We agree. Any remedy for a violation of the appellant's collective bargaining rights rests with the negotiated grievance procedure or the Federal Labor Relations Authority.[5] <span class="Italic">Filipczyk v. United States</span>, 386 Fed. Appx. 973, 976 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Request 3 is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Nor is the appellant s request reasonably calculated to lead to evidence relating to retaliation for union activity. The appellant was not engaged in union activity; her representative was.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 6</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">...</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">...</span>As for information relating to whether some employees were allowed greater flexibility than others in scheduling their furlough days, we agree with the administrative judge that this information is irrelevant and is unlikely to lead to the discovery of relevant evidence. It pertains to management decisions regarding scheduling of the furlough, which are matters outside the Board's jurisdiction.[6] An agency need not show that its furlough-related decisions were the best decisions, but only that they promoted the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). Therefore, request 6 is GRANTED only as to the identity of nonbargaining unit employees who were not furloughed and to the payment of overtime to nonbargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;An analogous situation would be an appellant in a suspension action contesting the day on which the suspension commenced. While the Board could review the suspension action itself, it would not have jurisdiction to hear a claim about the date on which the agency commenced the suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 9</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Request 9 seeks information related to the hiring of certain contract employees since the agency announced its intention to furlough current employees, noting certain specific individuals by name or title. The administrative judge denied this request on the basis that it concerns a spending decision within the agency's sound discretion. <span class="Italic">See Griffin</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 171.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without reaching the issue of whether such information might be discoverable in general, we affirm the administrative judge's decision on narrower grounds. Specifically, the appellant has not explained how any of the individuals named in request 9 have any connection with her position. This appellant is not a class representative of the other "appellants" to whom she refers in this request. Nor do the Wage and Investment Research contractors whom the appellant identifies have any apparent connection to her Senior Tax Analyst position in particular. For these reasons alone, request 9 is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 11</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In request 11, the appellant seeks information related to "the amount the IRS will continue to expend on items that could have been cut but may not have been such as conferences, hiring's [sic], management travel, training, etc. The appellant argues that this information is relevant because furloughing employees "while possibly not cutting other programs would not be a fair and even manner to shed costs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied request 11 on the basis that it sought only information relating to the agency's spending decisions. We agree. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 570. Request 11 is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 12</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In request 12, the appellant seeks information related to "other alternatives considered," including allowing employees to select their furlough days, allowing employees who want to serve furlough days for other employees to do so, and soliciting the input of bargaining unit employees into the furlough decision. The appellant argues that this information is necessary to determine "whether the furloughs were conducted in a manner that best promoted the efficiency of the service," and whether alternatives to closing the agency for entire days were considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied request 12, finding that it concerns management considerations underlying the agency's exercise of its discretion in determining what categories of spending should be reduced. We agree. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 570. We further note that the appellant has not identified a legal basis for the requirement that the agency show that its action best promoted the efficiency of the service, and we are unaware of such a requirement. Consistent with our ruling on request 8, we find that the law only requires that an agency action promotes the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). Request 12 is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 15</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Request 15 seeks information related to the Business Operating Division's "[p]rojected allocation for 2011, 2012, and 2013, and Actual expenditures for FY 2011, 2012, and 2013. The appellant argues that this information is necessary to determine whether the furlough was done in a fair and even manner by cutting all programs evenly because employees should not be required to take the disproportionate share of the sequestration cuts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied this request on the basis that it concerns unreviewable management considerations related to the agency's allocation of funding. We agree. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 570. Request 15 is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Request 16</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In request 16, the appellant seeks information related to fourteen specific decisions made by the IRS centering on how and why it chose the specific days for the furlough and the ramifications of those decisions on agency operating costs and efficiencies. The appellant again asserts that this information is necessary to determine whether "the furlough was in fact done in a manner that best promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied request 16, finding that the documents sought concern the agency's discretion in structuring the furlough, which is not subject to Board review. We agree. Once again, it is beyond the scope of Board review whether the furlough was conducted in a manner that <span class="Italic">best</span> promotes the efficiency of the service. There are many ways in which agency management could have structured the furlough, and it is not the Board's place to select from among them. Rather, the issue before the Board is whether the furlough was "in general" taken for such cause as promoted the efficiency of the service according to the standard set forth above. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. at 225. Request 16 is DENIED.</p>
