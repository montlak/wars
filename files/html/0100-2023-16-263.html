<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-263"><span class="space">a.</span> Negligence</h5>
<p class="noindent">To warrant liability, the union's actions must go beyond negligence or ineptitude. The union must have acted arbitrarily or in bad faith, and the action must have resulted in disparate or discriminatory treatment of a unit employee. Assuming that union membership is not a factor, negligence or miscommunication resulting in the failure to provide representation (at an MSPB hearing) does not breach the DFR, as long as it is not demonstrated that the employee is deliberately and unjustifiably treated differently from other bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">NFFE and Thompson</span>, 24 FLRA 320, 323 (1986). ULPs were dismissed that amounted to allegations of negligence in handling grievances. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1453 and Crawford</span>, 23 FLRA 686, 691 (1986). But there are decisions that establish a DFR through gross negligence in the course of union representation, even when the negligence has no relation to union membership of the represented employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although it is professed by FLRA that negligence does not make out a breach of the DFR, breach of the duty occurred when a union promised an employee it would file a grievance and then failed to do what it promised in <span class="Italic">IAM Local 39 and Evans</span>, 24 FLRA 352, 353 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e conclude that the Union's actions misled Evans into thinking that the Union was going to file the grievance, and Evans' reliance on the Union caused him to lose the right to file a timely grievance. We agree with the Judge that the Union's actions amounted to more than mere negligence and conclude that the Respondent deliberately and unjustifiably failed to file a grievance on behalf of Evans. We further conclude, in the absence of a showing to the contrary, that the Union treated Evans differently from other unit employees by failing to file his grievance. By this conduct, the Union breached its duty of fair representation...<span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Washington, D.C.</span>, 24 FLRA 320 (1986). That case involved an employee who requested his union to provide him with a representative at a hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). While the union in that case had initially agreed to provide representation to the employee, the union failed to appear at the hearing, which had been rescheduled several times. Based on the record in that case, we found that the union's failure to appear at the hearing constituted nothing more than mere negligence or miscommunication. Moreover, unlike here, the union's failure to represent the employee in that case did not extinguish the employee's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">IAM Local 39</span>, the ALJ inferred intentional misconduct from the union's assurances that it would handle the grievance of a suspension, from the failure of a union steward to respond to several inquiries concerning the status of the grievance made by the employee, and from the failure to file the grievance. The judge did not find explicitly any improper motivation or discrimination, and there were no explicit findings concerning the manner that other grievances were handled by the union. As a remedy, FLRA directed that the union seek permission from the employer to file a late grievance and then pursue the grievance with due diligence. If the employer refused, the union was directed to repay the employee for time lost during the suspension. There was no explicit finding that the employee should have or would have prevailed in the grievance had it been properly pursued. 24 FLRA at 361-63 (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IAM Local 39</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and Cyncynatus</span>, 31 FLRA 1208, 1213 (1988): there was no breach of the DFR by a union official who investigated a proposed suspension, received notice that the suspension had been taken against the employee, promised the employee that something would be filed, and then filed an untimely grievance after the union official returned from sick leave. FLRA suggested that the union official was inexperienced and should have obtained assistance in filing a timely grievance from another union official. Nonetheless, the union provided an explanation for its actions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IAM Local 39</span> was again distinguished in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1457 and Horn</span>, 43 FLRA 575, 583-85 (1991), involving a union's promise of general assistance to an employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e must determine whether, on the basis of the evidence established by credited testimony, the Union breached its duty of fair representation because it failed to file grievances over the three counselling letters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Judge, the Authority first addressed the question of whether a union violated the duty of fair representation required by section 7114(a)(1) in <span class="Italic">NFFE I</span> [<span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1453</span>, 23 FLRA 686 (1986)]. The standard applied in that and subsequent cases is "whether the union deliberately and unjustifiably treated one or more bargaining unit employees differently from other employees in the unit." 23 FLRA at 691. <span class="Italic">See also, American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3529, AFL-CIO</span>, 31 FLRA 1208 (1988) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>). To find that this standard has been violated, "the union's actions must amount to more than mere negligence or ineptitude, [and] the union must have acted arbitrarily or in bad faith...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">NFFE I</span>, the union failed to notify an employee that a grievance had been returned for refiling. The union took no further action and the employee lost the opportunity to grieve. However, the Authority found that there was no showing that the union's action constituted other than mere negligence or miscommunication, and dismissed the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, in <span class="Italic">IAM</span>, 24 FLRA 352, the Authority found that a union misled an employee into thinking it was going to file a grievance by reassuring the employee that it would take care of the matter, but ignoring repeated attempts by the employee to have the union file a grievance. The Authority found that the union's conduct amounted to more than mere negligence. The Authority concluded that the union deliberately and unjustifiably failed to file a grievance on behalf of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the Authority found that the union had plausibly explained its president's failure to timely file a grievance on behalf of an employee when the union official mistakenly believed that his illness would result in an extension of time to file. There was nothing in the record on which to base a conclusion that the president acted arbitrarily or in bad faith or deliberately and unjustifiably treated the employee differently from other unit employees. 31 FLRA at 1213. The Authority distinguished <span class="Italic">IAM</span> because in that case the judge concluded that the union had intentionally ignored the employee's requests to file a grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence in this case, based on credited testimony, is that when Horn received the three counselling letters, she went to Perdue. However, Horn did not ask Perdue to file grievances; nor did she specifically ask Perdue personally to represent her. Perdue responded he would do whatever was necessary to get the problems resolved, in effect assuring Horn "that he would take care of the problem."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this evidence, we cannot conclude that the Union violated its duty of fair representation by its treatment of Horn. Although Perdue may not have taken actions personally to address Horn's concerns, we agree with the Judge's conclusion that ultimately "[i]t is the Union, not Perdue as an individual, that has the duty to represent unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19. In this connection, a union president can delegate his or her responsibilities, especially where, as here, there is no evidence that an employee has expressly designated the president as her representative. The record shows that during the time Horn was concerned with her promotion and the letters of counselling, one of the Union vice presidents was representing her in connection with problems she was having with her supervisor, and other Union representatives were actively attempting to resolve problems concerning Horn's working <span id="page_1532"></span>environment. Significantly, as the Judge noted, "[i]t is probably more than a coincidence" that almost immediately after intervention by the Union asking for negative material to be removed from Horn's files, her supervisor revised the April 25 counselling letter in her favor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 18, 20-21.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Judge cited other actions by the Union that were part of an effort to deal with the letters of counselling. For example, vice president Hudson told Horn on one occasion that in his opinion, her whistleblowing complaint, which the Union was pursuing, would take care of any problems raised by the counselling letters. In sum, the record establishes that the Union was attempting to resolve Horn's letters of counselling, as Perdue had indicated it would....[w]e cannot find that in failing to do so the Union acted arbitrarily or in bad faith under the standard set out in <span class="Italic">NFFE I</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several factors distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">IAM</span>, where the Authority found a violation based on the union's failure to file a grievance. First, no specific request was made by Horn that the Union file grievances over the letters, and no promise to file such grievances was made by the Union. Thus, in agreement with the Judge, we find that any perceived improper failure to file grievances resulted from a misunderstanding by Horn of what the Union would do to "take care of the problem." In addition, the Union's various attempts to deal with Horn's problems, including efforts that resulted in some amelioration of the effect of the counselling letters, underscore the lack of arbitrariness or bad faith that must be present to conclude that an exclusive representative violated its duty of fair representation. Indeed, the Union did not ignore Horn's complaints, but pursued her interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the situation here does not require a "plausible explanation" for the failure to file a grievance, as the General Counsel contends. The actions of the Union in this case speak for themselves: effective or not, the Union's pursuit of the employee's interests was performed in a reasonable manner, especially in view of the absence of a specific request by the employee or promise by the Union to file grievances. As there is no evidence that the Union deliberately and unjustifiably treated Horn differently from other unit employees because of its failure to file grievances on her behalf, we shall dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whatever the occasional ambiguities in FLRA decisions, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that, without some direct contractual relation between the union and the employee, a union's activities arising out of the collective bargaining contract are governed by the duty of fair representation, and that the standard of liability is not negligence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am. v. Rawson</span>, 495 U.S. 362, 110 S. Ct. 1904 (1990). [Refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-18-044.html#sec10-45">Fair Representation Suit; Related Judicial Claim</a>."]</p>
