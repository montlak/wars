<p class="Body-Text">The reasoning in <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that reprisal for filing a grievance is protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), not section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1574-76; <span class="Italic">Mason v.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized that the Board must avoid blurring the deliberate and substantive distinction established by Congress between whistleblowing disclosures protected under subsection (b)(8) and the exercise of grievance rights protected under <span id="Page_3723"></span>subsection (b)(9)(A). <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1576 (citing <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1035). Thus, the court has held that an appellant cannot meet the jurisdictional requirements in an IRA appeal merely by inserting section 2302(b)(8) allegations into an agency grievance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this clear precedent, the appellant cites <span class="Italic">Bump v. Department of the Interior</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 326 (1994), for the proposition that "it simply does not matter that the protected disclosures were made within the grievance process when they otherwise establish the type of fraud, waste or abuse that the WPA was intended to reach." This is a misinterpretation of <span class="Italic">Bump</span> and the relevant law. In <span class="Italic">Bump</span>, the Board recognized that an employee may make a number of related disclosures based upon the same operative facts. <span class="Italic">Bump</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 332. Mr. Bump had made certain disclosures to OSC that could qualify as protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 331. The Board found that he was not disqualified from pursing an IRA appeal based on reprisal for making those disclosures to OSC merely because he also may have raised them as part of a grievance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 331-32. That is not the situation here. As set forth above, the issue in this appeal is limited to alleged reprisal only as a result of the appellant's grievance activity and disclosures of information in that context. Thus, <span class="Italic">Bump</span> is distinguishable, <span class="Italic">see Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1576 n.6, and the appellant's exhausted claims are properly considered as allegations of PPPs under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1574-76; <span class="Italic">Mason</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 22 n.6; <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 587-88.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the WPEA, under <span class="Italic">Smart v. MSPB</span>, 211 Fed. Appx. 969, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), an assertion of a violation of a regulation in the course of a grievance proceeding under a collective agreement did not constitute a protected disclosure under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) if the disclosure was not also made outside the grievance process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not reach the questions whether the standardized evaluation is an "employment practice" as defined by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101 nor whether Smart had a "reasonabl[e] belief" under the WPA as to the illegality of the practice. The forum in which the disclosures were made here prevents them from qualifying as protected disclosures under the WPA. It is undisputed that Smart made the alleged protected disclosures during the course of negotiated grievance proceedings with the agency. Although he repeated his allegations in his complaint to OSC, he was merely relating to OSC what had occurred during the negotiated grievance proceeding and not making separate allegations that would qualify as protected disclosures. Our cases have squarely held that disclosures made solely during grievance proceedings, and not separately disclosed to the agency, cannot form the basis for a whistleblowing claim. <span class="Italic">See Serrao v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Serrao v. MSPB</span>, 95 F.3d 1569, 1574-76 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Judge Newman dissenting), distinguished reprisal based on a grievance and reprisal based on a disclosure outside the grievance process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As seen above, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), an IRA appeal may be brought "with respect to any personnel action taken...as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8)...." This court has stated that section 1221 "gives the Board subject-matter jurisdiction only on claims brought under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)." <span class="Italic">Weber v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 9 F.3d 97, 100 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Serrao's claim that he suffered reprisal for filing a grievance against Ms. Moran is a charge of a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A), however. Among other things, that section makes it unlawful to take or threaten to take a personnel action against an employee because of the employee's "exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by law, rule, or regulation...." Serrao claimed that Ms. Moran undertook reprisal action against him because he exercised his right to file a formal grievance under Section 6 of the Grievance Order, which we view as a "rule" for purposes of section 2302(b) (9) (A). Because Serrao's complaint to OSC was based upon an alleged prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b) (9) (A), the Board did not have jurisdiction under section 1221. <span class="Italic">See Weber,</span> 9 F.3d at 100-01.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Serrao seeks to avoid the jurisdictional bar by making two arguments. First, he contends that the fact that he exercised rights under the Grievance Order should not bar Board jurisdiction. Serrao bases this argument on certain language in <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In <span class="Italic">Spruill,</span> we held that the filing of a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), in which an employee alleged discriminatory treatment by an agency in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights of 1964, did not constitute a whistleblowing disclosure within the meaning of section 2302(b) (8), but instead, was a nonwhistleblowing disclosure under section 2302(b)(9)(A). Consequently, we concluded that the Board was without jurisdiction over Spruill's IRA appeal. In the course of our decision, we noted that "investigative and remedial measures are available to Spruill through the EEOC," 978 F.2d at 692, and we catalogued those measures, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 692 n.17. Noting this language, Serrao states that the petitioner in Spruill "had [an] alternative forum in which to litigate his reprisal claim in which he could have received full relief." Serrao contrasts his situation, in which, under the Grievance Order, he was limited to seeking relief within the agency through informal and formal grievances decided by agency officials. Thus, Serrao argues that he had "no forum in which to litigate his claim other than the Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must reject Serrao's argument. First, section 2302(b)(9)(A) is unqualified. It refers to "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation...." (Emphasis added.) There is no caveat to the effect that the section only covers grievance rights with respect to which, in Serrao's words, an "alternative forum" such as the EEOC is available. Second, as the court pointed out in <span class="Italic">Spruill,</span> in enacting sections 2302(b) (8) and 2302(b) (9) (A), Congress purposefully drew a distinction between "reprisal based on disclosure of information and reprisal based upon exercising a right to complain." 978 F.2d at 690. The former is covered in section 2302(b) (8), the latter in section 2302(b) (9) (A). It was this distinction that formed the basis for the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 978 F.2d at 689-92. In view of the clear, unqualified language of the statute, we do not read the <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> court's discussion of the EEOC process as suggesting that the existence of the jurisdictional bar turns upon whether a "grievance right" granted by an agency "rule" includes remedies equivalent to those available in the EEOC process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Serrao's second argument against the jurisdictional bar is that, even assuming his OSC complaint was based upon alleged section 2302(b)(9)(A) reprisal, he nevertheless presented section 2302(b)(8) reprisal claims. In making this argument, he points out that in his March 10 complaint to OSC, he referred to the 1991 OIG investigation and stated that "on numerous occasions" Ms. Moran accused him "of being the one who called the OIG." He also points out that, in the "detailed response" that he included with his March 23 formal grievance, he discussed both the OIG investigation (and Ms. Moran's alleged belief that he was the source of the information that led to it), as well as his allegations concerning the termination of the undercover investigation and Ms. Moran's misuse of sick leave. Thus, Serrao contends that, in his formal grievance and in his complaint to OSC that he suffered reprisal for having filed the grievance, he raised a claim of reprisal for having made protected disclosures under section 2302(b) (8). Consequently, the Board has jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preliminarily, it is important to note that Serrao is complaining about two kinds of alleged reprisal: (i) reprisal that he suffered because of disclosures that were made anonymously but that were attributed to him (the 1991 OIG investigation); and (ii) reprisals that he suffered as a result of disclosures that he made (relating to the termination of the undercover investigation and the misuse of sick leave). We address the latter first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 7 F.3d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1993), we agreed that "where an employee makes one disclosure to supervisors in an agency grievance proceeding and one to the agency IG, the fact that both disclosures stem from the same set of operative facts is not necessarily inconsistent with the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1035. Thus, we stated that "the fact that Ellison filed a grievance through agency procedures in response to the contested personnel action did not in and of itself disqualify him from pursuing corrective action under the WPA as well" if he also presented his disclosures to the agency IG and, if necessary, sought corrective action from OSC. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, however, Serrao only made disclosures "in an agency grievance proceeding." He never presented to the OIG his allegations that Ms. Moran improperly terminated the undercover investigation and misused her sick leave. Consequently, the question squarely raised with respect to these allegations is whether the Board has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) when disclosures allegedly protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) (8) are made solely in the course of exercising agency grievance rights and never are presented outside of that context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 470 (1992), the Board held that only disclosures made outside grievance procedures or discrimination complaint procedures could serve as the basis for Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. Accordingly, in remanding to an administrative judge an appeal in which "the channels through which the appellant's disclosures were made" were "unclear," the Board stated: "If the [administrative judge] finds that all of the appellant's disclosures were made through the agency's grievance procedure or the discrimination complaint process, the appeals must be dismissed for lack of Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 473. We agree with <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>. Allowing a petitioner to meet the jurisdictional requirements for an IRA appeal by inserting section 2302(b) (8) allegations into an agency grievance would undercut <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>. It also would blur "the deliberate and substantive distinction established by Congress" between "whistleblowing" disclosures, protected under section 2302(b) (8), and the exercise of grievance rights, protected under section 2302(b) (9) (A). <span class="Italic">Ellison,</span> 7 F.3d at 1035. The Board did not have jurisdiction over the section 2302(b) (8) disclosures purportedly contained in Serrao's grievances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3724"></span><span class="Italic">Miller v. MSPB</span>, 626 Fed. Appx. 261, 269 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), explained and applied <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the applicable pre-WPEA &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) and &#x00A7; 1221(a), the Board could potentially have jurisdiction over Miller's disclosures if they fall within &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), but not &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). We have drawn a strict line between disclosures under these two provisions. We recognized that Congress "differentiate[d] between reprisal based on disclosure of information and reprisal based upon exercising a right to complain." <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 690 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see also Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1035 (identifying the "deliberate and substantive distinction established by Congress between reprisals based on 'whistleblowing' disclosures of government illegality, waste, and corruption...and reprisals based on exercising one's right to complain..."). Reading the disclosures covered by &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) too broadly to include activities under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) "would have the effect of reversing this carefully considered Congressional decision...render[ing] &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A) largely irrelevant, if not completely superfluous." <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 691. In <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, we explained that an employee can make separate disclosures based on the "same operative facts," with some made under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and others under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A), such that filing a grievance itself does not disqualify an employee from pursuing corrective action through an IRA. 7 F.3d at 1035.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We explained this statutory distinction in detail in <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>. In <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, the employee claimed that "even assuming his OSC complaint was based upon alleged section 2302(b)(9)(A) reprisal, he nevertheless presented section 2302(b)(8) reprisal claims." 95 F.3d at 1575. We clarified that the issue before the court was "whether the Board has jurisdiction...when disclosures allegedly protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) are made solely in the course of exercising agency grievance rights and are never presented outside that context." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1576. We agreed with the Board's conclusion that "only disclosures made outside grievance procedures or discrimination complaint procedures could serve as the basis for Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Smart v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 211 Fed. Appx. 969, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("Our cases have squarely held that disclosures made solely during grievance proceedings, and not separately disclosed to the agency, cannot form the basis for a whistleblowing claim."). We concluded that allowing an employee to meet the jurisdictional requirements for an IRA by placing &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) allegations into a grievance proceeding would "undercut <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>" and "blur" the distinction made by Congress between the types of disclosures covered in these subsections of &#x00A7; 2302. <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1576.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Miller presents the same question as in <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>: does the Board have jurisdiction over disclosures allegedly protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) when those disclosures are made solely during a grievance proceeding? In light of <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, we conclude that the disclosures Miller made during his grievance proceeding are protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), not &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Miller admits that he made the allegations about inadequate FDIC policies and proceedings as part of his grievance process. Even though he initiated the grievance proceedings because of the Letter of Warning, Miller alleges that some of the personnel actions taken against him were because of his continued desire to seek relief through the grievance process, including, presumably, his disclosures about FDIC policies and practices. The Board therefore properly concluded that Miller's disclosures were protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), and applying the pre-WPEA statute, did not err in dismissing Miller's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act did not wholly rewrite the law governing the status of grievances. A more elaborate explanation would have been helpful, but <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Dept. of Army</span>, PH-1221-13-0307-W-1 (NP 7/3/2014), offered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has shown no error in the administrative judge's determination that the filing of a grievance does not itself constitute a protected disclosure. Reprisal for exercising a grievance right is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), but not under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Mudd v.

In this regard, we note that the newly-enacted Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) does not change the result. The WPEA expanded the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) to include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). The WPEA extended the Board's IRA jurisdiction to claims arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), but not to those arising under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 7. The substance of the appellant's alleged grievance activity, as set forth in his pleadings below, did not implicate remedying an alleged violation of subsection (b)(8). Therefore, insofar as the appellant alleged that the agency took personnel actions in reprisal for exercising his right to file a grievance, the administrative judge correctly determined that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider such allegations in the context of this IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a Board appeal itself is not a protected disclosure under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), it is conceivable that a parallel protected disclosure external to the Board appellate process, as the Board implied in <span class="Italic">Luna v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is prohibited by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B) from retaliating against an employee for testifying as a witness in a Board appeal. It is well settled, however, that such testimony is not a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Flores v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 427, &#x00B6; 8 n.2 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of the Army</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 74, 78 (1991)). Allegations of retaliation under section 2302(b)(9) do not provide an independent basis for Board jurisdiction, and, absent an otherwise appealable action, such allegations are not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 11 (2006). Thus, an agency's action, allegedly taken in reprisal for an employee's having testified in a proceeding before the Board, is not appealable to the Board as an IRA appeal under the Whistleblower Protection Act because it constitutes a protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), instead of (b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, while the fact that an individual has engaged in activity protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) does not, in and of itself, disqualify the individual from seeking corrective action under 5 U.S.C. section 2302(b)(8) if she also made disclosures to the agency based on the same operative facts outside of her section 2302(b)(9) activity, in this case the appellant failed to assert that she made any disclosures of information outside of her testimony which could qualify as a protected disclosure under section 2302(b)(8). Therefore, the administrative judge correctly dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 504, 510 (1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Coffer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor did the appellant allege facts that, if proven, could show that her statement before the FLRA constitutes a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The WPA does not extend to reprisal for participation in grievances or FLRA ULP procedures; rather, such activity is protected under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 632, <span id="Page_3725"></span>635 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). The fact that an individual has engaged in activity protected under (b)(9) does not in and of itself disqualify the individual from seeking corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), if she made disclosures based upon the same operative facts outside of her (b)(9) activity. <span class="Italic">Luecht v. Department of the Navy,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 10 (2000). However, the appellant did not allege in her initial complaint before OSC that she made disclosures regarding the security cameras to any party other than AFGE or the FLRA. Thus, the appellant has not made a non-frivolous allegation that her disclosures regarding the security cameras constitute protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Chakravorty v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 304, &#x00B6; 13 (2001). We therefore find that the existing record does not support a finding that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mitchell,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> notwithstanding, <span class="Italic">Devera v. Smithsonian Inst</span>., <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DEVERA_VINCENT_DC_1221_05_0021_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249601.pdf">100 MSPR 653</a>, 658-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2005), determined that an IRA case could be triggered by disciplinary action based on a report of an agency's failure to negotiate changes in working conditions with a labor union--essentially an allegation of either an unfair labor practice or a related allegation of a violation of a collective bargaining contract:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claimed in his March 20, 2003 e-mail message that, based on his March 18th meeting with Chatman and Boyd, and on his conversation with the union representative for his guard unit, he had determined that the agency had neither notified the union of the shift change nor negotiated with the union regarding the shift change prior to its implementation. The AJ found that the appellant's claim that the change in shift times violated the CBA was not protected because the CBA was not a law, rule, or regulation as contemplated by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i). However, even if the provisions of the CBA do not amount to laws, rules, or regulations for the purposes of the WPA, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(d)(2), the union shall "(A) be informed of any substantive change in conditions of employment proposed by the agency, and (B) shall be permitted reasonable time to present its views and recommendations regarding the changes." Further, an agency must bargain over a change in the starting and quitting times of bargaining unit employees unless "the change is an exercise of management's right to determine the numbers, types, and grades of employees assigned to a work project or tour of duty" pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1940 v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 1058, 1061 (1990); <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution v. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2052</span>, 8 F.L.R.A. 604, 619 (1982). Nothing in the record indicates that section 7106(b)(1) applies here, because the shift change apparently affected only the daily starting and quitting times of the armorers and not the numbers, types, or grades of the armorers assigned to those shifts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant disclosed that the agency had made a substantive change in the conditions of employment without affording the union its right to notice of those changes and reasonable time to present its views and recommendations regarding those changes. Because the appellant has alleged that he confirmed that the union representative for his unit was unaware of any new policy changes or negotiations, the appellant has non-frivolously alleged that he had a reasonable belief that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(d)(2) by implementing the change without notice to or negotiation with the union. Further, the AJ found that the e-mail messages containing this disclosure were forwarded to the Secretary of the Smithsonian and the agency's general counsel, individuals clearly in a position to correct the alleged violation, and that the appellant had exhausted his administrative remedies with OSC. Also, nothing in the record indicates that, prior to the appellant's disclosures, these individuals were aware that the agency implemented the shift change without first negotiating the change with the union. <span class="Italic">Cf. Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1350 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (a disclosure that a known action is improper is not a protected disclosure). Therefore, we find that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant could reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence wrongdoing as defined by the WPA. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 528 U.S. 1153 (2000). Accordingly, the appellant made a non-frivolous allegation that he made a protected disclosure regarding the agency's alleged violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(d)(2), satisfying one element of the <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> standard for establishing Board jurisdiction over his IRA appeal. 242 F.2d at 1371.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, AT-1221-13-0239-B-1 (NP 12/9/2014), <span class="Italic">post</span> (disclosures to agency management of facts constituting potential unfair labor practices, i.e., statutory violations, were within the ambit of 5 USC 2302(b)(8)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At first the Board decided that a claim for workers' compensation benefits was precluded under <span class="Italic">Williams</span> for treatment as a whistleblowing disclosure. <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 51 MSPR 378, 380 (1991). On reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 59 MSPR 503, 508-09 (1993), decided that a FECA claim was not an appeal or a complaint, but a claim for compensation for a work-related injury rather than "initial steps toward taking legal action against an employer for the perceived violation of an employee's rights[.]" Although a FECA claim would not be disqualified as a mode of whistleblowing, the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch</span> that the statements made in the appellant's claim--involving disclosure of sexual harassment--did not constitute a disclosure protected under the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employee who files a Form CA-1 is exercising his or her right to file a "claim" for "payment of compensation" under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 8121 and 8124. In adjudicating a FECA claim, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) determines whether the claimant has provided sufficient evidence of a nexus between the injury and her course of employment and, if so, the amount and kind of compensation to be awarded. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. United States</span>, 16 Cl. Ct. 546, 548 (1989). The OWCP is not empowered to grant relief for any underlying personnel practices that may have led to the injury. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co. v. United States</span>, 372 U.S. 597, 601, 83 S. Ct. 926, 928-29 (1963) (FECA statutory scheme provides right of relief for work-related injury and is not concerned with other rights or liabilities).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Comparing the nature and scope of a FECA claim with, for example, an appeal to the Board, a complaint filed with the EEOC, an Unfair Labor Practice complaint, or a grievance, we conclude that the submission of a FECA claim for compensation for a work-related injury does not constitute an initial step toward taking legal action against an employer for the perceived violation of an employee's rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 46 MSPR at 553. Accordingly, we find that the filing of a CA-1 is not the "exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right" within the terms of 5 USC 2302(b)(9) and could, under the appropriate circumstances, constitute whistleblowing under section 2302(b)(8). However, although we conclude that the Board does not lack jurisdiction to hear and decide an IRA appeal simply because the disclosure is made in a FECA claim, the nature of the disclosure may nonetheless divest the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If whistleblowing allegations in an OWCP claim are related in another manner that is protected, the assertions are protected, as <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Costello</span>, 75 MSPR 562, 587 (1997), suggested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the record establishes that, on November 5, 1992, Steen filed a 38-page application for workers' compensation based on work-related depression. On the application, Steen stated that he "suffered abuse, intimidation, and threats from management in addition to the routine dangers and disruptions of [his] job." His chronological description of events and incidents generally corresponded to the information provided to Cole and Costello. Therefore, to the extent we previously determined that these disclosures were protected in another context, we find that the disclosures made in Steen's OWCP application are also protected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Costello</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Luecht v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 297, 305 &#x00B6; 5 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some IRA cases involve reprisals against those who report safety infractions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. GSA</span>, 45 MSPR 411 (1990). A complaint to OSHA or to an agency safety office is covered by 2302(b)(8), according to <span class="Italic">Owen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 63 MSPR 621, 627-28 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]here, as in the instant case, there is a disclosure of a violation of law or regulation or danger to public health or safety, arguments can be made for coverage under either 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). It is an axiom of statutory construction, however, that a statute should not be interpreted so as to render one part superfluous. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 MSPR 595, 612 (1991), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 52 MSPR 375 <span class="Italic">and aff'd</span>, 981 F.2d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1987). As we found in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, 46 MSPR 549, 553 (1991), 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) cannot be read literally or it would broadly override and make redundant the provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). Rather, we must interpret subsections (b)(8) and (b)(9) in a manner which makes both subsections meaningful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams</span> we found that subsections (b)(8) and (b)(9) offer protection for distinctly different activities. <span class="Italic">Williams</span> at 553. Subsection (b)(9) protects "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The use of these terms suggests that Congress intended for subsection (b)(9) to cover formalized adjudicative proceedings. The types of activities that we have held to constitute (b)(9) allegations--equal employment opportunity complaints, Merit Systems Protection Board appeals, unfair labor practice charges, Privacy Act procedures, and grievances--all involve formalized adjudicative proceedings....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSHA's regulations state that an employees' report of an actual or potential unsafe or unhealthful working condition to either an agency safety office or OSHA is not a grievance. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1960.28(a). Furthermore, the process followed by an agency safety office or by OSHA after the receipt of a report of a safety problem at a Federal facility does not resemble a formalized adjudicative process. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1960.28(d) and (e). Where certified employee/management occupational safety and health committees exist, reports of safety problems at federal facilities <span id="Page_3726"></span>are addressed through those committees. 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1960.28(b)-(d) and 1960.36. Where certified committees do not exist, or when requested by half the members of a certified occupational safety and health committee, OSHA may conduct inspections of the workplace. 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1960.28(e)(3) and 1960.31. If the inspection reveals violations, the inspector, on behalf of the Secretary of Labor, notifies the agency, which is expected to abate the hazard. 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1960.30 and 1960.31. At no time during the process does a formal adjudication of the violation occur.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's disclosures to the agency safety office and his letter to OSHA, although constituting the use of formal channels of communication, do not constitute an appeal, complaint, or grievance, we find that they are not the type of activities contemplated by Congress under subsection (b)(9). While the appellant refers to his disclosures as "complaints," they are informal "complaints" as that term is used to denote gripes or objections rather than complaints lodged in a formal adjudicative process. The facts of the particular situation must control over the labeling by an employee or an agency.[5] Further, we find that disclosures to OSHA or an agency safety office are not automatically restricted to subsection (b)(9) solely because they are allowed by agency regulations and a grievance mechanism exists within the agency to protect employees from reprisal. Similarly, we find that OSHA's regulation prohibiting reprisal for disclosures to it does not automatically place all disclosures to that agency under subsection (b)(9) and negate the protection of the Whistleblower Protection Act. To the contrary, we find that disclosures to OSHA or an agency safety office, which otherwise meet the requirements of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), are within the Board's individual right of action jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The fact that the appellant's motivation was personal does not prevent his disclosure from being protected<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Nafus v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 386, 398 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Owen</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Smith v. USDA</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 52-54 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter to the Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Administration (OSHA) dated May 27, 1991, the appellant alleged that he and his co-workers were subjected to the following unsafe conditions: (1) Employees, who often work alone in remote areas, have no means by which to obtain help in an emergency, and furthermore, the agency has no system for finding an employee who does not return from the worksite at the end of the day; (2) employees have been issued an "extremely dangerous tool" for extricating stuck vehicles, yet they have been given no first aid training; (3) employees need headgear to protect them from windblown particulates, pesticides, and the hydrochloric acid (HCI) with which they work; (4) the agency does not have adequate facilities for an emergency eyewash in the event that an employee were accidentally splashed in the face with HCI; and (5) employees use power equipment and other tools, but do not have protective footgear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the <span class="Italic">Owen</span> standard, the appellant's disclosure to OSHA was protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(i). The fact that the appellant asked OSHA, which is responsible for enforcing workplace safety and health standards, to investigate conditions at his own agency, shows that he believed that the matters he described in his letter evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation. Indeed, he implies in his letter that the agency was in violation of "the Occupational Safety and Health Act." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7902; 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 651-678. Furthermore, his belief that he was disclosing violations of law, rule, or regulation was reasonable. His letter is detailed, and cites his use of safety equipment while he worked at a university laboratory for his belief that the agency should provide such equipment to its employees. Furthermore, in June of 1991, OSHA conducted an investigation in response to the appellant's letter, concluded that some of the specific conditions that he had identified were "hazards" that violated OSHA standards, and ordered the agency to correct the conditions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Easterbrook v. DOJ</span>, 85 MSPR 60, 66 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (OSHA complaint constitutes a protected disclosure).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(b)(9) does not embrace the filing of a criminal complaint charging assault and battery against a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ledeaux v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 440, 444 (1985). General advocacy in an associate's disciplinary action does not constitute activity protected under 2302(b)(9) without involvement by appellant or his associate in any kind of appeal, complaint, or grievance right from the disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Stover v.

<p class="Body-Text">Under a decision predating the WPEA, a complaint of reprisal by reason of an IRA complaint to OSC that apparently did not itself include a whistleblowing claim was a matter covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(9), not a matter subject to an IRA Board appeal under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), <span class="Italic">Gockley v. Dept. of Army,</span> NY-1221-10-0169-W-1 (NP 9/30/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant reasserts her argument below that the agency "retaliated against me for filing with OSC." As the administrative judge correctly determined, an agency's action, allegedly taken in reprisal for an employee's having filed a complaint with the OSC, is not appealable to the Board as an IRA appeal under the WPA, because it constitutes a protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), instead of (b)(8). <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of the Army</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 296, 302 (1993). Our reviewing court has found that the essential difference between the protections of sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9) is the difference between reprisal based on disclosure of information and reprisal based upon exercising a right to complain. <span class="Italic">Serrao v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 95 F.3d 1569, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Here, the appellant alleges reprisal based on exercising her right to complain to OSC. Her allegations, however, were insufficient to put OSC on notice that she intended to raise a whistleblower claim. Therefore, the appellant has failed to exhaust her remedies with OSC as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gockley</span> noted that the appellant's allegations to OSC could have construed as assertions of prohibited personnel practices under 5 USC 2302(b)(6), involving unlawful preferences relative to employment of individuals, and that type of allegation would appear to fall within the scope of 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A), covering disclosures of violations of law or abuse of authority. The <span class="Italic">Gockley</span> analysis is subject to dispute; at least the analysis is too broadly stated. A complaint to OSC may contain a disclosure covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(8) and, learning of that disclosure, an agency manager could retaliate. Under the WPEA, 5 USC 1221(a) provides IRA access to the Board if there is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(a)(1). The latter statute includes a complaint under any law with regard to remedy a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(8). For a whistleblower allegation to OSC, reprisal appears covered under the WPEA.
