<p class="Body-Text">Time-in-grade requirements are established by 5 CFR 300.604 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Restrictions.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following time-in-grade restrictions must be met unless advancement is permitted by &#x00A7; 300.603(b) of this part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Advancement to positions at GS-12 and above</span>. Candidates for advancement to a position at GS-12 and above must have completed a minimum of 52 weeks in positions no more than one grade lower (or equivalent) than the position to be filled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Advancement to positions at GS-6 through GS-11</span>. Candidates for advancement to a position at GS-6 through GS-11 must have completed a minimum of 52 weeks in positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;No more than two grades lower (or equivalent) when the position to be filled is in a line of work properly classified at 2-grade intervals; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;No more than one grade lower (or equivalent) when the position to be filled is in a line of work properly classified at 1-grade intervals; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;No more than one or two grades lower (or equivalent), as determined by the agency, when the position to be filled is in a line of work properly classified at 1-grade intervals but has a mixed interval promotion pattern.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Advancement to positions up to GS-5.</span> Candidates may be advanced without time restriction to positions up to GS-5 if the position to be filled is no more than two grades above the lowest grade the employee held within the preceding 52 weeks under his or her latest nontemporary competitive appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM issued a regulation eliminating time-in-grade restrictions effective March 9, 2009. 73 Fed. Reg. 66157 (Nov. 7, 2008), but OPM then withdrew its final regulation on August 11, 2009. 74 Fed. Reg. 40057 (Aug. 11, 2009), citing a need for a more comprehensive examination of pay, performance and staffing issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The purpose of time-in-grade requirements (and the distinction between those requirements and requirements of specialized experience as a required qualification for a position) was noted in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> AT-300A-10-0718-I-1 (NP 3/21/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Time-in-grade and specialized experience are two very different concepts. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Langster v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 435, 437 (1986) (noting the difference between time in grade and specialized experience as a required qualification for a position). Time-in-grade refers to how long an individual has been in a particular grade; this requirement is intended to prevent rapid promotions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 300.601, 300.604, 338.301. In contrast, specialized experience refers to the experience that has equipped the applicant with the particular knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform successfully the duties of the position and is typically in or related to the work of the position to be filled. Office of Personnel Management, Guide to Qualification Standards, General Polices, Part C. The appellant is mistaken that proof of one is always proof of the other. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed. Reg. 2546, 2547 (explaining that even if OPM were to abolish time in grade requirements, specialized experience requirements would not be affected because they are not the same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Hellman v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 639, 641-43 (1982), the appellant challenged OPM's time-in-grade requirement through an employment practice appeal. The Board found nothing amiss:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the time-in-grade requirement is an appealable employment practice within the meaning of 5 CFR 300.104(a), it is instructive to look to the history both of its development as a basic civil service tenet and to that of the employment practice requirements articulated in part 300, subpart A. We also must look to the intent of OPM (formerly the Civil Service Commission) when it created a right of appeal to the Board for an alleged employment practice violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The time-in-grade regulations at issue here provide generally that an agency may not advance a competitive or excepted service employee unless he has served at least one year at the next lower appropriate grade level. 5 CFR 300.601 to 300.605. These requirements were originally enacted by Congress during the Korean War. Pub. L. No. 82-253, 68 Stat. 736, Nov. 1, 1951. Known as the Whitten Amendment and codified at 5 USC 3101, the statute was designed as a fiscal measure intended to prevent excessively rapid promotions and undue growth of the bureaucracy. It also served to permit agencies to make annual budget plans that accurately forecast salary costs. The Civil Service Commission (now OPM) subsequently established the present time-in-grade regulations and, upon expiration of the Whitten Amendment in 1978, retained these regulations in order to foster the policy of preventing "excessively rapid promotions." Federal Personnel Manual Chapter 300, S-6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conversely, 5 CFR 300.101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> had its genesis in the civil rights laws. The regulations were originally proposed by the Civil Service Commission to ensure that examining, testing and other employment practices would not be affected by discriminatory or other non-merit factors and to provide for appeals and grievances relative to such an employment practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 36 Fed. Reg. 11817 (June 19, 1971) and 36 Fed. Reg. 15447 (August 14, 1971). In addition to its general authority to manage the federal work force, the Civil Service Commission specifically cited 5 USC 7151 and 7154 as authority for issuance. These sections generally relate to the antidiscrimination policy and minority recruitment program of the federal government. Furthermore, the Uniform Guidelines on Employment Selection Procedures (1978), incorporated by reference in 5 CFR 300.103(c), were promulgated simultaneously by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor and the former Civil Service Commission to offer guidance with respect to employment practices that are unlawful under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 42 USC 2000e-2(a). The fundamental principle underlying the guidelines is avoidance of employment "policies" or "selection procedures" that have an adverse impact on the federal employment opportunities of any race, sex or ethnic group. <span class="Italic">See</span> 43 Fed. Reg. 38290 (August 25, 1978). Thus the major thrust of part 300's "employment practice" provisions is to ensure equal opportunity and merit selection in the federal government's testing and screening of employees and applicants for employment. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Hampton</span>, 512 F.2d 976 (D.C. Cir. 1976). Accordingly, it is evident that the root premise of the time-in-grade restriction varies significantly from the general thrust of the selection and testing provisions found elsewhere in part 300.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To further aid our analysis with respect to the appealability of the time-in-grade restrictions we turn now to OPM's intent regarding the jurisdiction it conferred on the Board in 5 CFR 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is derived from both statutory and regulatory sources. The appellate jurisdiction of the board is based on 5 USC 7701 which provides that an employee or applicant for employment may submit an appeal from any action which is appealable to the board under any law, rule or regulation. Examples of statutory grants of jurisdiction include authority to adjudicate the appeal of an employee who has been affected by an agency action based on unacceptable performance (5 USC 4303(e)), who has been subjected to an adverse action (5 USC 7513(d)), who has been denied legal or disability retirement (5 USC 8347(d)), or who has been denied a periodic step increase (5 USC 5335(c)). On the other hand, examples of jurisdiction conferred by OPM regulation include the authority to hear certain probationer's appeals (5 CFR 315.806 and 315.908) and employee appeals concerning reductions-in-force (5 CFR 351.901), reemployment rights (5 CFR 352.209), and employment practices (5 CFR 300.104). Where the Board's jurisdiction is conferred upon it by OPM, we think OPM's interpretation of the intended scope of that grant is entitled to great deference. <span class="Italic">Udall v. Tallman</span>, 380 U.S. 1, 85 S. Ct. 792, 13 L. Ed.2d 616 (1965). And as a general matter the Board has treated jurisdiction conferred by regulation somewhat more conservatively than that acquired by statute. <span class="Italic">Compare</span>, <span class="Italic">Gaxiola v. Air Force</span>, 6 MSPB 432, 6 MSPR 515 (1981), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPB 282, 8 MSPR 624 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant situation, OPM's assertions concerning the intended scope of the 5 CFR 300.104 right of appeal are both logical and reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's contention that the time-in-grade restrictions are essentially fiscal in nature is substantiated by the historical development of the requirement. The fact that they pre-date the establishment of the employment practice provisions of part 300 further suggests that OPM did not intend to make them appealable when it enacted 5 CFR 300.104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_861"></span>Although courts have generally construed the meaning of "employment practices" broadly to include any practice, procedure, or test which influences the employment process, we cannot conclude that the time-in-grade restriction, which is applied to all positions in both the competitive and excepted service, is so similar to tests or other examination devices intended to measure individual qualifications to perform a certain job, that it is within the range of actions which OPM intended to make appealable to the board.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note that the cases which have construed the meaning and validity of employment practices have involved attacks on practices which were alleged to have a discriminatory impact on groups protected by Title VII of the Civil Right Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-2(a), and not in the context of analyzing grants of jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</span>, 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971); <span class="Italic">Afro-American Patrolmen's League v. Duck</span>, 503 F.2d 294 (6th Cir. 1974). No claim of discrimination has been made in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we do not find OPM's position that the time-in-grade regulations are not appealable inconsistent with the original purpose for which the employment practice regulations were developed, and conclude that the Board is without jurisdiction to hear the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of whether the Board could hear a challenge to a time-in-grade restriction was revisited in the less than pellucid decision of <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The appellant appealed when the Army rated him ineligible as a GS-12 Operations Analyst. He claimed that time-in-grade restrictions were improperly applied to him. The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, reasoning that the validity of time-in-grade restrictions was not an appealable matter because the restrictions did not constitute an employment practice within the meaning of 5 CFR 300.101. The court remanded the case: the Board construed its jurisdiction too narrowly. The court determined that time-in-grade restrictions are an employment practice within the meaning of 5 CFR Part 300. After having once reviewed the case and ordered a remand to the Board to consider its jurisdiction, the appellate court affirmed the Board's dismissal of the case. The court noted that 5 CFR 300.104(a) provides a Board appeal only when an employment practice is applied by OPM. The Board lacked jurisdiction because OPM did not apply the employment practice. The basis of the second appellate opinion was that "since OPM played no part in the ineligible rating given to petition by the Department of the Army, OPM had not applied any employment practice to petitioner." There the opinion ended, lamentably failing to identify who applied the practice (the Army, presumably), whether the Army was operating under delegated authority from OPM (and with what result), and whether the time-in-grade restrictions (applied by OPM or under delegated authority) would be an appealable employment practice. <span class="Italic">Dowd v. OPM</span>, 745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Board's jurisdiction over appeals challenging time-in-grade restrictions was elaborated on to a degree in <span class="Italic">Langster v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 435, 436 (1986) (remanding to region to permit the appellant to complete discovery from OPM). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gulka v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 220, 221 (1982) (time-in-grade restrictions are essentially fiscal and not appealable under 5 CFR 300.104).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employment practice challenge based on time-in-grade should establish, as a matter of jurisdiction, that the appellant was applied for or was performing in the position supporting the claim for the higher grade, as the Board seemed to suggest in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> CH-315H-10-0653-I-1 (NP 11/23/2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB</span>, 431 Fed. Appx. 915 (2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant asserts that he applied and was denied a promotion to a GS-14 Senior Flow Through Specialist position based on the time-in-grade requirement. The agency has produced evidence that it has no record of such an application. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant applied and was nonselected due to the time-in-grade requirement, he has nevertheless failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the requirement was misapplied. The appellant appears to assert that he was performing the duties of the GS-14 position he applied for in his GS-13 probationary position. He also asserts that there is no GS-13 level Flow Through Specialist position and thus no opportunity to obtain the relevant experience. There is no evidentiary support, however, for the appellant's assertion that he was performing GS-14 duties and no evidence that he otherwise had any experience equivalent to the 1-year time in grade at the GS-13 level. The record is devoid of any facts to show that the time-in-grade requirement was misapplied in the nonselection raised by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB</span>, 431 Fed. Appx. 915, 917 (2011), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Johnson's allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his position reclassification claim is also without merit. Mr. Johnson cites 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5114 to support his argument, but this section was repealed in 1986. Pub.L. 99-386, Title I, &#x00A7; 110(a), Aug. 22, 1986, 100 Stat. 822. Based on his most recent submission to the Board, Mr. Johnson likely intended to refer generally to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5101-5115 (2006), as he alleged that the agency had refused to reclassify his position from the GS-13 level to the GS-14 level in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5110 and 5112 authorize OPM to review position classifications, the Board has no authority to hear appeals of such reviews. <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985). This court's decision in <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span> held that two conditions must be met to provide the Board jurisdiction: first, the appeal must concern an "employment practice" subject to review by the Board; and second, the allegation that the employment practice has violated "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 must be nonfrivolous. 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In this case, Mr. Johnson has not identified an employment practice that is subject to review by the Board in his appeal; and second, he has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he has been deprived of one of the "basic requirements" set forth in &#x00A7; 300.103. As such, the Board was correct in its determination that it lacked authority to hear Mr. Johnson's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Rejecting an employment practice challenged based on an agency's application of what amounted to a time-in-grade requirement, under <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Smithsonian Institution,</span> NY-3443-14-0350-I-1 (NP 6/23/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d 720, 721-22 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Dowd I</span>), the agency conceded that it erroneously applied the time-in-grade restrictions set out in 5 C.F.R. Part 300, Subpart F to an applicant. The court found that the agency's action constituted an "employment practice" for purposes of a Board appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 723-24. Accordingly, the court remanded for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 724. Pursuant to that remand, the Board further adjudicated the matter, concluding that jurisdiction was still lacking because there was no OPM involvement in the agency's erroneous application of the time-in-grade regulations. <span class="Italic">See Dowd v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Dowd II</span>). In <span class="Italic">Dowd II</span>, our reviewing court affirmed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> cases demonstrate, even if the agency erroneously applied the regulatory time-in-grade restrictions, as the appellant alleges, rather than simply borrowing language from 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.605(b) as a discretionary method of measuring the appellant's qualifications, there is no indication that OPM was involved in any way. <span class="Italic">See generally Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888 (to characterize an agency's nonselection as a practice applied by OPM for purposes of jurisdiction in an employment practices appeal, OPM's involvement in the selection process must be significant). Accordingly, the appellant failed to meet his burden of proving, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that his appeal concerns an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering.</p>
