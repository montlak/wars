<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-76"><span class="space">2.</span> Reasonable Belief of Crime</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The courts accept the Board's view that the statute does not require an agency to prove the criminal charge prior to invoking the shortened notice provision; it only requires that there be reasonable grounds to believe that the employee has committed the crime. 5 USC 7513(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Knuckles v. Bolger</span>, 654 F.2d 25 (8th Cir. 1981). But what constitutes reasonable cause to believe?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In litigation resulting from the strike of the air traffic controllers, a court concluded that an agency could invoke a shortened (seven-day) response period because of a controller's unexplained absence during a well-publicized strike, provided there was a reasonable basis for the agency belief that the employee committed the crime of striking against the government. <span class="Italic">Novotny v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 521 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (there was no need for an independent investigation; citing <span class="Italic">Schapansky</span>: "Novotny's unexplained absence during a well-publicized strike established 'a reasonable basis for its belief that he had committed the crime of striking against the government.'"); <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 210, 213 (1983) (same result as <span class="Italic">Novotny</span>; citing <span class="Italic">Schapansky</span>); <span class="Italic">Schapansky v. FAA</span>, 13 MSPR 589, 595 (1982) ("Because 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1918 provides that participation in a strike against the United States is a felony, punishable by up to one year of imprisonment, and because appellant was absent from work during the strike and was among the picketers, the Board concurs with the presiding official's finding that the agency had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment might be imposed. Thus the agency's invocation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(l) was justified."). It was immaterial that the striking charge was joined with another charge that would not support a shortened notice. <span class="Italic">Schapansky v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 477 (Fed. Cir. 1984). An arrest for an alleged probation violation supported reasonable belief sufficient to invoke a shortened notice period for an indefinite suspension in <span class="Italic">Sharpe v. EPA,</span> DA-0752-14-0034-I-1 (NP 2/27/2015) ("When the agency imposed the appellant's suspension, the agency had before it information that the appellant had previously been charged with a second degree felony, that he entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and had been placed on probation, that he had recently been arrested on charges that he violated the terms of his probation, and that he could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon his violation of probation."). The Board's view that it is not necessary to prove criminal intent to invoke the crime exception to the notice requirement was given deference by the court in <span class="Italic">Boylan v. USPS</span>, 704 F.2d 573 (11th Cir. 1983): it was sufficient for the agency to have had reasonable cause to believe a crime had been committed without a specific showing of intent. The agency was not required to show a criminal conviction or to bring formal criminal charges to invoke the crime exception.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An indictment supported a shortened notice period, <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 284, 290 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 241 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because the agency took advantage of the shortened notice period, it must establish that it had reasonable cause to believe the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Department of Justice</span>, 480 F.3d 1309, 1311-14 (holding that the "reasonable cause" requirement is not a substantive requirement applicable to cases in which an employee has received at least 30 days advance notice of the proposed action), <span class="Italic">petition for reh'g and reh'g en banc denied</span>, 508 F.3d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In light of the appellant's indictments by a grand jury on multiple felony charges, we find that the agency has established that it had such reasonable cause, <span class="Italic">see Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("[a]n indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceedings, would provide, absent special circumstances, more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold requirement of reasonable cause to suspend.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That an indictment resulted from information from agency personnel did not diminish it as a basis for a shortened notice period, <span class="Italic">Henderson v. VA</span>, 878 F.3d 1044, 1048-51 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (affirming <span class="Italic">Henderson v. VA</span>, 123 MSPR 536, 2016 MSPB 29 (2016)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to what is commonly referred to as the "crime exception," <span class="Italic">see Morrison v. Nat'l Sci. Found</span>., 423 F.3d 1366, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2005), however, an agency can suspend an employee with advance notice of less than thirty days in situations in which it has "reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 50 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2772. Henderson contends that the VA improperly invoked the crime exception when it suspended him on shortened notice, asserting that his indictment on fifty counts of making false statements related to health care matters in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1035 did not give the agency "reasonable cause" to believe that he had committed a crime punishable by imprisonment. Although Henderson does not dispute that an indictment issued by a grand jury generally constitutes sufficient cause for an agency to suspend an employee indefinitely, he contends that his indictment did not provide reasonable cause for his suspension because the VA itself "procured" that indictment using "vague allegations." According to Henderson, because employees of the VA allegedly supplied the grand jury with the testimony and evidence it considered when it returned the indictment against him, the grand jury did not act as an "independent arbiter of facts," but instead functioned "merely as the catspaw of the [VA]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find this argument persuasive. "The grand jury's historic functions survive to this day. Its responsibilities continue to include both the determination whether there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and the protection of citizens against unfounded criminal prosecutions." <span class="Italic">United States v. Calandra</span>, 414 U.S. 338, 343 (1974); <span class="Italic">see also Wood v. Georgia</span>, 370 U.S. 375, 390 (1962) ("Historically, [the grand jury] has been regarded as a primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable function in our society of standing between the accuser and the accused, whether the latter be an individual, minority group, or other, to determine whether a charge is founded upon reason or was dictated by an intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will." (footnote omitted)); <span class="Italic">Costello v. United States</span>, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956) (emphasizing that the grand jury has long held a "high place...as an instrument of justice"). The record here is devoid of any evidence suggesting that the federal grand jury which returned the indictment against Henderson failed to independently and impartially weigh the evidence presented. That the VA allegedly provided the evidence supporting Henderson's indictment does not negate the fact that an independent deliberative body determined that there was probable cause to believe that he had committed a serious crime. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 934 (1997) (explaining that an indictment "serve[s] to assure that [a] state employer's decision to suspend [an] employee is not baseless or unwarranted in that an independent third party has determined that there is probable cause to believe the employee committed a serious crime" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">FDIC v. Mallen</span>, 486 U.S. 230, 244 (1988) ("The returning of the indictment establishes that an independent body has determined that there is probable cause to believe that [an officer of a federally-insured bank] has committed a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term in excess of one year."); <span class="Italic">see also James A. Merritt &#x0026; Sons v. Marsh</span>, 791 F.2d 328, 330 (4th Cir. 1986) ("A decision to issue an indictment is made by a deliberative public body...operating under constitutional and other legal constraints.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reasonable Cause</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 7513(b)(1) authorizes an agency to suspend an employee on shortened notice when it has "reasonable cause" to believe that he has committed a serious crime, it does not demarcate the precise point on the criminal justice continuum at which this reasonable cause standard will be satisfied. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. U.S. Customs Serv</span>., 47 F.3d 415, 419 (Fed. Cir. 1995). We have previously made clear, however, that when evaluating whether to invoke section 7513(b)(1)'s crime exception, an agency must remain cognizant of an employee's right to "be protected from premature or unfounded" suspension. <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1992). On the other hand, when there is good reason to believe that an employee has engaged in criminal activity, particularly where that activity is job-related, it is incumbent upon an agency to act promptly "to protect the public and agency personnel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Morrison</span>, 423 F.3d at 1369; <span class="Italic">Pararas-Carayannis v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955, 958 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Where, as here, an employee is indicted on serious employment-related charges, allowing him to remain on duty could both tarnish an agency's reputation and impede its ability to carry out its mission. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662, 667 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("An indictment is a public record, and public knowledge that an <span id="Page_3221"></span>individual formally accused of job-related crimes is still on duty would undoubtedly erode public confidence in the agency.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the fact that an employee has been questioned by the police regarding his suspected involvement in criminal activity might not, depending on the situation, suffice to establish reasonable cause, <span class="Italic">see id</span>., an agency can, in appropriate circumstances, rely on an arrest warrant coupled with "additional factual material culled from [a criminal complaint] and supporting allegations," when invoking section 7513(b)(1)'s crime exception.[3] <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157-58. As we have repeatedly made clear, moreover, "an indictment for a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed will, as a general rule, provide reasonable cause for an agency to believe that the employee has committed such a crime." <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, 47 F.3d at 419; <span class="Italic">see Rhodes</span>, 487 F.3d at 1380 ("Where...the employee has been indicted for a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and the nature of the crime relates to the employee's ability to perform his or her duties, the requirements of section 7513 will have been met."); <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157 ("[a]n indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceedings, would provide, absent special circumstances, more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold requirement of reasonable cause to suspend."); <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, 533 F.2d 538, 543 (Ct. Cl. 1976) ("[I]t was entirely proper to predicate [an employee's] indefinite suspension solely upon the fact of indictment."). Here, as the board correctly concluded, Henderson's indictment on fifty counts of making false statements related to veterans' health care matters provided the VA with more than ample justification for invoking section 7513(b)(1)'s crime exception. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 540-41.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As we explained in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, "it is not the arrest that matters but the issuance of the warrant--the additional act of sending enforcement officials to locate the subject of the warrant to carry out what the warrant authorizes does not add anything to the reasonable cause determination." 956 F.2d at 1157 (footnote omitted); <span class="Italic">see Gerstein v. Pugh</span>, 420 U.S. 103, 111-13 (1975) (noting that magistrates may issue arrest warrants in criminal cases only when they have been presented with sufficient evidence to provide probable cause to believe that the person charged has committed a crime). In some unusual situations, an agency will have reasonable cause to suspend an employee on shortened notice even in the absence of either an arrest or a warrant. <span class="Italic">See Schapansky v. FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 477, 486 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (concluding that an air traffic controller's "unexplained absence during a well known strike established [a] reasonable basis for the agency to believe that he was [participating in the strike] and thereby automatically established [a] reasonable basis for its belief that he had committed the crime of striking against the government").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to Henderson's assertions, the VA had no obligation, in the wake of his indictment, to evaluate additional evidence and conduct further witness interviews before suspending him. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("It is not the responsibility of all government agencies to investigate criminal activity of their employees and generally they are neither authorized nor funded to do so."). If the VA had continued to investigate Henderson's alleged criminal conduct following his indictment, it might have improperly interfered with the ongoing criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Peden v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1099, 1103 (Ct. Cl. 1975). Indeed, a post-indictment investigation by the VA could have prejudiced Henderson's criminal defense. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1156 (noting that an agency's continued investigation of an employee's alleged criminal activity could "force a premature airing of the individual's defense in a pending criminal case").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Due Process</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Henderson further contends that the VA violated his right to due process by failing to provide him with adequate notice of the specific charges against him. In support, he asserts that the VA "refus[ed] to provide any explanation or evidence supporting its claim to reasonable cause that he committed a serious crime."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument falls flat. "The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond." <span class="Italic">Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985); <span class="Italic">see Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &#x0026; Trust Co</span>., 339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950) ("Many controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause but there can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case."). When it proposed his suspension, the VA provided Henderson with written notice of the charges against him, explaining that it had reasonable cause to believe that he had committed a crime punishable by imprisonment based on the fact that he had been indicted on fifty counts of making false statements related to health care matters. The agency stated, moreover, that the investigation leading to his "[i]ndictment revealed that during the period of February 6, 2014[,] through February 11, 2014, consults for medical care were closed without evidence of care being delivered or Veteran refusal of medical services." The VA further explained that the investigation that led to Henderson's indictment indicated that he had "ordered employees under [his] supervision to close over 2700 unresolved consults for medical care for Veterans by falsely declaring the consults to have been completed or refused by the patients."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"One cannot validly be indicted on abstract charges; an indictment must set forth specifically the alleged criminal conduct." <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 715 F.2d at 666. The indictment relied upon by the VA when it suspended Henderson contained detailed information, specifying fifty occasions on which he had allegedly "caused to be written in the medical records of VA patients the statement 'services have been completed or patient refused services,' well knowing and believing that the services had not yet been provided, and that the patients never refused the services." We reject, therefore, Henderson's unsupported assertion that he lacked adequate information to respond competently to the charges underpinning the VA's proposed suspension action. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 542 (noting that the VA's letter proposing Henderson's suspension "described the contents of the indictment and the results of the investigation that led to the indictment"); <span class="Italic">see also Brennan v. HHS</span>, 787 F.2d 1559, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("The purpose of an agency's notice of charges is to put an employee on notice of the allegations against him in sufficient detail to apprise him of the allegations he must refute or acts he must justify.").[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In general, an agency takes an adverse personnel action against an employee if it "will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a); <span class="Italic">see Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1154. In order to demonstrate that a suspension promotes the efficiency of the service, an "agency must establish a nexus between [an employee's] alleged acts of misconduct and the employee's job responsibilities." <span class="Italic">Pararas-Carayannis</span>, 9 F.3d at 957. On appeal, Henderson does not challenge the determination that his suspension promoted the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 540.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The shortened notice provision may be invoked on the basis of information directly known to the agency or on the basis of an investigation conducted by someone else. As to information known to or developed by the agency that takes action against the appellant, "reasonable cause to believe" existed in <span class="Italic">Davis v. TVA</span>, 11 MSPR 367, 368-69 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon examining the record in this case, the Board finds that the agency did have reasonable cause to believe that appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could have been imposed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wink v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 9 MSPB 74, 9 MSPR 431 (1982). Specifically, the agency was presented with the following situation. An agency check in the amount of $250.00 was missing. A store owner called in to say that he had cashed the check, but that (at the agency's request) the bank stopped payment on it. The store owner stated that he was familiar with the person who had presented the check; he subsequently positively identified appellant as that person. Also, the store owner provided the agency with the automobile license number of the person who had presented the check. The agency called in the Chattanooga police. The police began an investigation, and traced the automobile license number to appellant's car. Appellant was interrogated, and then arrested. He admitted to the offense, was charged with uttering and passing a forged instrument, and was temporarily incarcerated. He was indicted, and a trial date was set.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the agency, presented with the above situation, did have reasonable cause to believe that appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. Appellant was therefore entitled to a notice period consisting of a "reasonable time, but not less than 7 days...[,] " during which time he was entitled to be retained in a pay status. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) and (2)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 20 MSPR 547, 550 (1984) (reasonable belief supporting an indefinite suspension may be established on the basis of information developed by the agency, an ongoing investigation by the FBI, and referral of a theft-related charge to the U.S. Attorney for possible criminal prosecution); <span class="Italic">Niece v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 99, 103 (1982) (report of investigation by a postal inspector); <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Body-Text">Referral for investigation, however, does not provide the reasonable cause needed to shorten the notice period. <span class="Italic">Varner v. DHHS</span>, 10 MSPR 635, 638 (1982) (there is no reasonable cause to believe that a crime has occurred as to a falsified sick leave justification referred for investigation to a postal inspector). The existence of an investigation by the agency and referral to the U.S. Attorney for further investigation is not reasonable cause to believe that the appellant has committed a crime. <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 5, 10 (1984) (shortened notice period, indefinite suspension, and removal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 37 MSPR 589, 591-92 (1988), defined the type of investigation and related circumstances that support a shortened notice period coupled with an indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3222"></span>An agency may invoke the "crime exception" of 5 USC 7513(b)(1) to shorten the advance notice period of an action, including an indefinite suspension, when it has "reasonable cause" to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed.... An indefinite suspension, based upon "reasonable cause" to believe that an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, is not to punish alleged misconduct but to allow examination into such conduct.... Examples that would establish "reasonable cause" under 7513(b)(1) include: (1) An indictment; (2) an employee arrested and held for further legal action by a magistrate; (3) an arrest or investigation accompanied by such circumstances showing reasonable cause; (4) a criminal information; and (5) certain egregious acts such as murder or national security offenses, which are detrimental to the agency's mission, brought to the agency's attention via the news media....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an investigation or arrest, standing alone, is insufficient to establish "reasonable cause" to invoke the shortened notice procedure of 7513(b)(1) to effect an indefinite suspension, an investigation or arrest may be accompanied by such circumstances that would give rise to a showing of "reasonable cause."... Thus, we disagree with the administrative judge's determination in the instant case that an agency cannot effect an indefinite suspension action under the shortened notice procedure...based on the evidence uncovered by an investigation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we concur in the administrative judge's determination that the agency in this case has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it had "reasonable cause" to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, so as to justify his indefinite suspension.... At the time of the agency's decision, the appellant had not been arrested, indicted, or bound over by a magistrate. The appellant was never arrested, and he was not formally charged...until after the agency issued the decision notice. The appellant's alleged criminal conduct was not an egregious act, such as murder or a national security offense. At the time it effected the indefinite suspension action, the agency had available and relied on only the police reports and other documentation contained in the police file. The agency did not conduct any investigation of the appellant's alleged conduct beyond a review of the police files and discussions with police officials concerning the police investigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The information relied upon by the agency at the time it invokes a shortened notice period controls the validity of the action. If the agency did not have reasonable cause at the time it imposed the suspension, later conviction of the appellant for criminal conduct does not retroactively validate the shortened notice period and resultant suspension from duty during the remainder of the notice period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Benton v. Dept. of Army</span>, 13 MSPR 357, 359 (1982).
