<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-3"><span class="space">1.</span> Background and History</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The federal retirement systems are complex--just as they are in the private sector (consider ERISA). The purpose of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> is to provide decisions of the MSPB and the courts, with necessary references to statutes and regulations. Some of the statutes and regulations governing and guiding the federal retirement programs are referenced in those decisions and in this chapter, but those references are a tiny segment of all that is found on the programs in the U.S. Code, the CFR, and OPM guidance (also referenced but not reprinted in this chapter). To provide background on the principal federal retirement programs--CSRS and FERS (and the Thrift Savings Plan)--we quote liberally from (and with thanks to) the Congressional Research Service for its Publication 98-810, "Federal Employees' Retirement System: Benefits and Financing" (November 2019) [footnotes and tables omitted] <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/98-810">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/98-810:</a></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Summary</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most civilian federal employees who were hired before 1984 are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Federal employees hired in 1984 or later are covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). Both CSRS and FERS require participants to contribute toward the cost of their pensions through a payroll tax to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The minimum retirement age (MRA) under CSRS is 55 for workers who have at least 30 years of service. The FERS MRA is 55 for employees born before 1948, is 56 for employees born between 1953 and 1964, and increases on an incremental basis to 57 for those born in 1970 or later. Both FERS and CSRS allow retirement with an unreduced pension at the age of 60 for employees with 20 or more years of service and at the age of 62 for employees with at least 5 years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement savings plan similar to the 401(k) plans provided by many private-sector employers. In 2019, employees covered under either CSRS or FERS can contribute up to $19,000 to the TSP. Employees aged 50 and older can contribute an additional $6,000 to the TSP. Employees under FERS receive employer matching contributions of up to 5% of pay from their federal employing agency. Federal workers covered by CSRS also can contribute to the TSP, but they receive no employer matching contributions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employers pay three other costs for employees under FERS: (1) both the employer and employee pay Social Security taxes equal to 6.2% of pay up to the maximum taxable amount; (2) agencies automatically contribute an amount equal to 1% of employee pay to the TSP; and (3) agencies make matching contributions to the TSP equal to up to 4% of pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most civilian federal employees who were hired before 1984 are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Under CSRS, employees do not pay Social Security taxes or earn Social Security benefits. Federal employees first hired in 1984 or later are covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). All federal employees who are enrolled in FERS pay Social Security taxes and earn Social Security benefits. Federal employees enrolled in either CSRS or FERS also may contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP); however, only employees enrolled in FERS are eligible for employer matching contributions to the TSP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Origins of the Federal Civilian Retirement System</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress passed the Civil Service Retirement Act of 1920 (P.L. 66-215) to provide pension benefits for civilian federal employees. In 1935, Congress created the Social Security system for workers in the private sector. During the 1950s, Congress allowed state and local governments to bring their employees into Social Security, and today about three-fourths of state and local employees are covered by Social Security. Federal employees remained outside of Social Security until Congress passed the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21). This law required all civilian federal employees hired into permanent employment on or after January 1, 1984, to participate in Social Security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Enrolling federal workers in both CSRS and Social Security would have resulted in substantial duplication of benefits and would have required employees to contribute more than 13% of pay to the two programs. Consequently, Congress directed the development of a new retirement system for federal workers with Social Security as its cornerstone. The new plan was designed to include many features then existing in the retirement plans of large private-sector employers. The result of this effort was the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335), enacted on June 6, 1986. The FERS has three elements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--Social Security,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the FERS basic retirement annuity and the FERS supplement, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the Thrift Savings Plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FERS covers employees initially hired into federal employment on or after January 1, 1984, and employees who voluntarily switched from CSRS during "open seasons" in 1987 and 1998. Former federal employees who had completed at least five years of service under CSRS and were later rehired by the government after a break in service could either join FERS or participate in the "CSRS offset plan." Under the CSRS offset plan, 6.2 percentage points of the employee's payroll contribution (up to the Social Security taxable wage base) and an equal share of the employer contribution are diverted from CSRS to the Social Security trust fund. Later, the retiree's CSRS annuity is reduced (offset) by the amount of his or her Social Security benefit. Both CSRS and the CSRS offset program will terminate with the death of the last worker or survivor still covered under that program, which the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) estimates will occur around the year 2090.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Two Types of Retirement Plans</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employers establish retirement plans both to help them attract workers with valuable skills and to enable older workers to retire without facing the prospect of inadequate income. Employers must balance the goals of providing adequate retirement income with controlling the cost of <span id="Page_4074"></span>the retirement plan. For private-sector employers, another important consideration is the regulatory environment in which their retirement plans must operate. Private-sector retirement plans must comply with the relevant provisions of federal law, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Retirement programs generally can be classified as either <span class="Italic">defined benefit</span> (DB) plans or <span class="Italic">defined contribution</span> (DC) plans. In a defined benefit plan, a worker's retirement benefit is typically paid as a life annuity based on years of service and average salary. A defined contribution plan is much like a savings account maintained by the employer on behalf of each participating employee. The employer and/or employee contribute a specific dollar amount or percentage of pay into an account, which is usually invested in stocks and bonds. When the worker retires, he or she receives the balance in the account, which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest, dividends, and capital gains (or losses), net of fees and expenses. The retiree usually may choose to receive these funds as a series of payments over a period of years or as a lump sum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An important difference between the two types of retirement plans is that in a defined benefit plan the <span class="Italic">employer</span> bears the financial risk, whereas in a defined contribution plan the <span class="Italic">employee</span> bears the financial risk. In a defined benefit plan, the employer promises to provide retirement benefits in the form of a life annuity or its actuarial equivalent. To pay the promised benefit, the employer must make contributions to a pension fund, which is invested in stocks, bonds, and other assets. The employer's contributions plus the expected investment earnings on the contributions must be sufficient to pay the pension benefits that workers have earned under the plan. The employer is at risk for the full amount of retirement benefits that have been earned by employees. If the pension plan is underfunded, the employer must make additional contributions so that the promised benefits can be paid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a defined contribution plan, the employee bears the investment risk. For example, if the contributions to the plan have been insufficient or if the securities in which the contributions have been invested lose value or appreciate too slowly, the employee might reach retirement age without the financial resources needed to maintain his or her desired standard of living in retirement. If this occurs, the worker might have little choice but to delay retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CSRS is a DB plan that provides a standalone annuity. FERS includes both DB and DC plan elements (i.e., the FERS annuity and the TSP, respectively).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Eligibility and Benefit Amounts Under FERS and CSRS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under both CSRS and FERS, the date of an employee's eligibility to retire with an annuity depends on age and years of service. The amount of the retirement annuity is determined by three factors: (1) the number of years of service, which are prorated based on completed months, (2) the accrual rate at which benefits are earned for each year of service, and (3) the salary base to which the accrual rate is applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Retirement Age and Years of Service</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under CSRS, a worker with at least 30 years of service can retire at the age of 55; a worker with at least 20 years of service can retire at the age of 60; and a worker with 5 or more years of service can retire at the age of 62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees are fully vested in the FERS basic retirement annuity after five years of service. The FERS minimum retirement age (MRA) for an employee with 30 or more years of service was 55 for workers born before 1948. The MRA under FERS began to increase in 2003 for workers born after 1947. The MRA for employees born between 1953 and 1964 is 56. It will increase on an incremental basis to 57 for those born in 1970 or later. A worker who has reached the MRA and has completed at least 30 years of service can retire with an immediate, unreduced annuity. A worker with 20 or more years of service can retire with an unreduced annuity at age 60, and a worker with at least 5 years of service can retire at age 62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under FERS, an employee can retire with a reduced benefit at the minimum retirement age with at least 10 years of service. For an employee who does not qualify for an unreduced annuity, the retirement benefit is permanently reduced by 5% multiplied by the difference between 62 and the retiree's age at the time the annuity begins. For example, an employee with at least 10 years of service, but fewer than 30, who retires at 56 would receive a pension benefit that is reduced by 30% below the amount that would be paid to an individual with the same salary and years of service who retired at the age of 62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Social Security and the "FERS Supplement"</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Social Security retirement benefits cannot begin before the age of 62, Congress included in FERS a temporary supplemental benefit for workers who retire before age 62. This "FERS supplement" is paid to workers who retire at the age of 55 or older with at least 30 years of service or at the age of 60 with at least 20 years of service. It is also paid to law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers who retire at the age of 50 or later with 20 or more years of service. The supplement is equal to the estimated Social Security benefit that the individual earned while employed by the federal government. It is paid only until the age of 62, regardless of whether the retiree chooses to apply for Social Security retired worker benefits at 62 years old.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Thrift Savings Plan</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The TSP is a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan similar to the 401(k) plans provided by many private-sector employers. The TSP is a key component of FERS, especially for workers in the middle and upper ranges of the federal pay scale, who are unlikely to achieve adequate retirement income--as measured by the replacement rate--from Social Security and the FERS basic annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2019, federal employees can contribute up to $19,000 to the TSP. Employees aged 50 and older can contribute an additional $6,000. These employee contributions may be made on a pretax basis, in which case neither the contributions nor investment earnings that accrue to the plan are taxed until the money is withdrawn. Alternatively, P.L. 111-31 authorized a qualified Roth contribution option to the TSP. Under a Roth contribution option, employee salary deferrals into a retirement plan are made with after-tax income. Qualified distributions from the Roth TSP plan option--generally, distributions taken five or more years after the participant's first Roth contribution and after the age of 59 1/2--are tax-free.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For all federal workers under FERS, the employing agencies contribute to the TSP an amount equal to 1% of each employee's base pay, whether or not the employee contributes anything to the plan. In addition, employees enrolled in FERS can receive employer matching contributions equal to 4% of pay, according to the schedule shown in Table 2. Federal workers covered by CSRS also may contribute to the TSP, but they receive no matching contributions from their employing agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">TSP participants are immediately vested in their contributions to the plan, all federal matching contributions, and any interest, dividends, or capital gains attributable to those contributions. Participants are fully vested in the 1% agency automatic contribution to the TSP after three years (two years for congressional employees and executive branch political appointees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">TSP Investment Options</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The value of an individual's TSP account at retirement will depend on how much he or she contributed to the TSP each year, the number of years over which contributions were made, and the investment earnings of the TSP funds. Participants in the TSP may choose among five funds in which they can invest their TSP contributions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--The "C" fund invests in a stock market index fund that replicates the <span class="Italic">Standard and Poor's 500</span> Index of 500 large to medium-sized U.S. companies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--The "F" fund invests in bonds in the same proportion as they are represented by the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--The "G" fund invests in U.S. government securities and pays interest equal to the average rate of return on government securities with maturities of four years or more.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--The "S" fund invests in a stock index fund that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index of small to medium-sized U.S. companies not included in the "C" Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--The "I" fund invests in a stock index fund that replicates the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Index.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2005, the TSP added a "Lifecycle Funds" option. Lifecycle Funds are invested in various combinations of the five existing TSP funds. According to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, participants who invest in these funds "benefit from having professionally designed asset allocation models available to optimize their investment performance by providing portfolios that are appropriate for their particular time horizon." The participant's time horizon is based on the future date he or she expects to begin withdrawing money from the TSP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">TSP Withdrawal Options</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee can withdraw funds from the TSP after leaving federal service in three ways. Funds can be withdrawn</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--as a life annuity,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--in a single lump-sum payment, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--in a series of monthly payments, either for a fixed number of months or in a fixed dollar amount until the account is depleted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4075"></span>A retiree can choose to have payments begin immediately or at a later date. In general, there is a 10% tax penalty for those who withdraw funds before the age of 59 1/2. However, the penalty does not apply if the individual has retired and is aged 55 or older, or if the withdrawals are taken as a series of substantially equal periodic payments based on the person's remaining life expectancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective September 15, 2019, additional options for in-service and post-service TSP withdrawals are available, as authorized under the TSP Modernization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-84). These expanded withdrawal options include multiple postseparation partial withdrawals; additional inservice withdrawals for participants aged 59 1/2 or older and still employed in federal service; and a new choice about withdrawals from a traditional TSP balance, a Roth balance, or a proportional mix of both; among other new TSP withdrawal flexibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Employer and Employee Contributions to CSRS and FERS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both CSRS and FERS require participants to contribute toward the cost of their future pensions through a payroll tax. Under CSRS, employees contribute 7.0% of base pay to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). Under FERS, employees first hired before 2013 contribute 0.8% of pay to the CSRDF and they also pay Social Security taxes (6.2% on salary up to the maximum taxable wage base of $132,900 in 2019). FERS employees first hired in 2013 contribute 3.1% of pay to the CSRDF as well as Social Security taxes. FERS employees first hired after 2013 contribute 4.4% of pay to the CSRDF as well as Social Security taxes. Participants in CSRS are not covered by Social Security....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contributions to CSRS and FERS are not deposited into individual employee accounts. Nor is the amount of a federal worker's pension based on the amount of his or her contributions. All contributions are paid into--and all benefits are paid out of--the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Employee contributions pay for a comparatively small part of the retirement annuities paid by CSRS and FERS. There are, however, both budgetary and actuarial reasons that federal employees are required to contribute to CSRS and FERS.</p>
