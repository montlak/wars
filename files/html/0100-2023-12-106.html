<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-105"><span class="space">d.</span> Waiver, Settlement of Interim Relief; Employment Status Change</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Interim relief may be waived by the appellant. A waiver may be desirable if the appellant secures other employment following adverse action and decides the more prudent course is to stick with the current job until the Board's <span id="Page_1696"></span>decisional process is final. The Board blessed waiver of interim relief, over agency objections, <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 340, 349-50 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant has filed a motion for waiver of the administrative judge's interim relief order because he is "presently employed." The appellant contends that the Board's regulations at 5 CFR 1201.115(b) require an agency to offer an employee interim relief before filing a petition for review with the Board unless the agency can show that the employee's return to duty would create an undue hardship. He argues that the regulation favors the employee and that "Congress was most concerned with an agency's refusal to reinstate and not with a situation where, as here, the removed employee" wishes to forego interim relief until the appeal is final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In opposition to the appellant's motion for waiver of interim relief, the agency argues that it would be prejudiced by the appellant's failure to return to work during the interim relief period because it would be unable to fill the appellant's vacant position. The agency also intimates that a waiver of interim relief would permit the appellant to "affect[ ] the potential back pay the [a]gency may owe him."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no merit to the agency's contentions. We note that the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16, its legislative history, and the Board's implementing regulations are silent on the issue of a waiver of interim relief. We find, however, that the intent of interim relief is to protect the appellant from hardship during the pendency of his appeal if he prevails in the initial decision.... Also, we note that Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations provide that interim relief ordered in an initial decision can end when, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, an employee requests that such interim relief be cancelled<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 772.102(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not argued that it is precluded from filling the appellant's position temporarily. Further, a waiver of interim relief would relieve the agency of the obligation to award the appellant back pay and benefits for the interim relief period and would not result in a windfall to the appellant. Rather, the appellant would receive pay and/or benefits from his other employment. Ordering the appellant to return to work and possibly lose his other employment would be contrary to the intent of interim relief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Herrin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 95 MSPR 536, 545-46 &#x00B6; 18 (2004) (Board construed as a waiver of interim relief the opportunity offered by the agency to place the appellant in a GS-5 position at the Step 6 level but the appellant decided to stay in a GS-6 position in a temporary appointment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Waiver of interim relief is at the appellant's option. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 69 MSPR 585, 588 (1996). If the waiver results from an agreement between the parties, the waiver or settlement of interim relief must truly reflect that agreement, <span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 144, 147-49 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The statute...states that the relief will remain in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review. However, the agency relies on OPM's interim relief regulations which provide that interim relief shall end when the employee and agency reach an agreement that it be cancelled. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 772.102(b)(3) (1995). Contending that it reached an agreement with the appellant that he be reassigned to another position in lieu of reinstatement to his former job, the agency essentially contends that the interim relief order is no longer in effect by the consent of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is the agency responsible for promulgating regulations to implement the interim relief provision, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2) and (k) (1994), and it is therefore not required to defer to OPM's interpretation of the statute<span class="Italic">. McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 192, 200 n.4 (1992). However, it is the Board's policy to encourage settlement of employment disputes. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 678, 680 (1989) (settlement of appeals is favored as a means of avoiding unnecessary litigation and encouraging fair and speedy resolution of issues). Thus, the Board may give effect to an agreement to cancel interim relief when it determines after careful scrutiny that the appellant and the agency have in fact reached such an agreement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mahoney</span> <span class="Italic">v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 149 (1988) (appeal should not be dismissed as settled until record documents that parties reached settlement and understood its terms).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the document on which the agency relies to show an agreement is a memorandum from the appellant to the agency's Regional Director through the Florence, Colorado, Warden. It is signed by the appellant and the Warden, but not by the Regional Director, and it makes no reference to the interim relief order. In it, the appellant agrees to a reassignment in lieu of reinstatement to his former position if several conditions are met. On its face, the memorandum appears to be an offer, rather than an agreement, since there is no explicit statement by a representative of the agency accepting the terms of the appellant's proposed agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency apparently relies on documentation that it has made the reassignment to which the appellant agreed as evidence that it accepted the appellant's proposal. It is true that the acceptance of an offer may be made by promise or by rendering the requested performance, but in either case it must manifest assent to the same bargain proposed by the offer. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 50 (1979). Here the agency has not shown that it has met the conditions which the appellant stated, and evidence which the appellant has submitted tends to show that it has expressly rejected some of them. Several of the appellant's conditions involved providing him certain benefits attendant upon his relocation, i.e., reservation housing, moving expenses, authorization to move a third motor vehicle, and per diem for his son. Yet, in a memorandum to the appellant dated one day after the purported agreement, the Regional Director states that the appellant is entitled to the same benefits as any other reassigned individual, but that "no special considerations will be permitted." Neither the Regional Director's January 4, 1995 letter to the appellant notifying him of his reassignment nor the SF-50 of the reassignment refers to the alleged agreement. We therefore agree with the appellant that the record fails to establish that the appellant and the agency in fact reached an agreement to substitute the reassignment to Sandstone for the interim relief ordered by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hatcher v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 10 MSPB 116, 11 MSPR 135 (1982) (it was error to dismiss appeal on basis of executory settlement agreement which was never finalized).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be effective, waiver of interim relief must be informed, <span class="Italic">Dennis v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 462, 466 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]ontrary to the agency's argument, it is of no consequence that the appellant requested to be placed on LWOP. The Board has recognized that an agency may be relieved of its obligation to provide interim relief if the appellant waives his right to receive interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 340, 349-50 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, however, the appellant filed a motion for waiver of interim relief with the Clerk of the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 349. In this case, in contrast, the appellant did not file a motion for waiver of interim relief with the Board. Rather, he made an August 31, 1993 request for LWOP with the agency's Chief of Engineering Services, Jay Wilkins. Moreover, that request for LWOP appears to be in response to the agency's previous August 27, 1993 letter directing him to either return to duty, if his physician cleared him for duty, or to contact Wilkins to request "appropriate leave." The appellant's simple request for LWOP, submitted to the agency according to the agency's instructions, does not constitute an informed waiver of the appellant's statutory entitlement to interim relief in light of Congress's intent to protect the appellant from hardship during the pendency of his appeal if he prevails in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, at 350; <span class="Italic">cf. Covey v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 367, 372 (1992) (in light of the Board's strong policy consideration that an appellant receive a hearing on the merits of his appeal, the right to a hearing may be waived only by implication if there is a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act showing such a purpose).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For waiver to be informed, it must be entered with an understanding of one's rights concerning the Board appeal process. <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 316, 320-21 (1995), involving the appeal of a supervisory correctional officer (formerly an employee development specialist), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency correctly points out that an appellant who prevailed in an initial Board decision may waive his or her right to interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 340, 350 (1993). In support of its argument that the appellant herein waived his right to interim relief, the agency relies on the declaration of Warden Jack Hilton, who avers as follows: After the initial decision was issued, Hilton "called [the appellant] in" and told him that he would be placed in a GS-12 Employee Development Specialist position; the appellant "agreed to such placement," and asked for "transitional training"; the meeting was "positive and cordial," and the appellant "thanked" Hilton for his assistance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the appellant, "having enjoyed the interim relief appointment to which he agreed[,] cannot now in all fairness claim that his interim relief appointment negates" the agency's petition for review. If the agency had shown that the appellant understood his rights under the initial decision and under statute, and freely waived them, then we would be inclined to hold that the agency's petition for review should not be dismissed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Smith</span>, 59 MSPR at 350 (an appellant made an effective waiver of his right to interim relief by filing a motion with the Board, in which he explained that he had found other employment). The agency has made no such showing, however. Despite the supposedly friendly atmosphere of the meeting between Hilton and the appellant, based on the agency's evidence we can find nothing more than that the appellant, upon being called in to see the Warden, acquiesced in the Warden's plans. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rivas v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 121, 131 (1994) (even if a settlement agreement was properly interpreted as including a waiver of the appellant's right to appeal an alleged constructive suspension to the Board, the agreement was not a "knowing waiver of rights," and thus, the appeal-rights waiver provision would not be enforced; the agency "failed to inform the appellant of any appeal right he might have had"). Under the circumstances, we conclude that the appellant did not agree to excuse the agency from its statutory obligation either to provide the relief ordered by the initial decision on an interim basis, or to justify its decision not to do so by making an undue disruption determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Barron v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 68 MSPR 446, 451 (1995), reiterated that acceptance <span id="Page_1697"></span>of a change in duties does not necessarily constitute informed waiver of full interim relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that, because the appellant agreed to the assignment as TMU Supervisor, he cannot now claim that that assignment does not constitute full interim relief. A showing by the agency that the appellant understood his rights under the initial decision and under statute, and freely waived them, could result in the agency's petition for review not being dismissed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Smith v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 340, 350 (1993) (an appellant made an effective waiver of his right to interim relief by filing a motion with the Board in which he explained that he had found other employment). The agency has not shown, however, that the appellant understood his rights under the initial decision and under statute, and freely waived them. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 67 MSPR 316, 321 (1995). Despite the allegedly cordial atmosphere of the meeting between the appellant and agency officials relative to his placement, based on the agency's evidence we can find only that the appellant acquiesced in the agency's plan. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such acquiescence is not sufficient to release the agency from its obligation to comply with the administrative judge's interim relief order. Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant did not agree to excuse the agency from its statutory obligation either to provide the relief ordered in the initial decision on an interim basis, or to justify its decision not to do so by making an undue disruption determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 303, 308-09 (1995), concluded that an agency did not violate Board interim relief requirements by placing the employee on leave without pay at the employee's informed request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that, under the circumstances of this case, the agency's placing the appellant on leave without pay does not constitute noncompliance with the interim relief order. In his affidavit, O'Leary sets forth the following chronology of events. On approximately February 14, 1995, O'Leary telephoned the appellant to advise him that he would be returned to duty. At that time, the appellant informed O'Leary that he was medically unable to return to work because of a work-related injury suffered in March 1994. In a February 15, 1995 letter to the appellant, Ronald J. Dowdy, Chief Patrol Agent, directed the appellant to return to duty on February 23, 1995, or to request leave to cover his absence. On February 23, 1995, the appellant called his supervisor, Senior Border Patrol Agent Clyde J. Benzenhoefer, and reiterated that he was unable to perform his duties because of the injury. By letter dated February 24, 1995, the agency provided the appellant with forms to complete and asked him to provide medical documentation to justify his continued absence from work. The agency has submitted the February 15, 1995 letter, the February 23, 1995 memorandum of telephone call, and the February 24, 1995 letter supporting O'Leary's statements. The agency has also submitted the appellant's application for leave without pay, dated February 27, 1995, in which he indicates that he is "awaiting DOL status"; and a March 10, 1995 letter to the appellant from the Department of Labor stating that it has accepted his claim for injury of March 13, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dennis v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 462, 465-66 (1994), the Board found that the agency had not complied with the interim relief order when it neither returned the appellant to duty nor provided him with pay, compensation, and benefits to which he was entitled, but instead directed him to submit medical information showing that he was ready, willing, and able to work. It further found that the appellant's request to be placed on leave without pay did not constitute an informed waiver of interim relief as he had not moved for such a waiver, and his request was filed in response to the agency's letter directing him either to return to work or to apply for appropriate leave. <span class="Italic">See also Abbott v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 124, 131-32 (1995) (Member Amador dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board has also noted that neither its decision in <span class="Italic">Dennis</span> nor its finding in <span class="Italic">Abbott</span> requires an employer to provide employees with pay, compensation, and all other benefits from the date of the initial decision, regardless of whether they are willing to return to work. It further noted that an agency remains free to withhold pay, or otherwise discipline employees who do not report for work having been directed to do so, or, alternatively, to grant leave to employees who freely request it. <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, 67 MSPR at 129.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's submissions show that the latter is what happened in this case. Here, the agency did not condition the appellant's return to duty on the submission of medical evidence; rather, it simply requested such evidence as support for the appellant's freely given request for leave. Thus, we conclude that the agency has complied with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Slater v. DHS</span>, 108 MSPR 419, 423 &#x00B6; 4, 2008 MSPB 73 (2008) (appellant was not denied interim relief when he requested and received leave without pay after being reappointed to his previous position, grade, and pay after issuance of the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should the employee resign a position and transfer to another agency, interim relief is not appropriate. Under <span class="Italic">Armstrong v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of the statutory interim relief provision is not to make the appellant whole at the interim relief stage of the proceedings. <span class="Italic">Ginocchi v.

Rather, the intent of interim relief is to protect the appellant from hardship during the pendency of his appeal if he prevails in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Herrin v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 15 (2004); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 340, 350 (1993). More generally, interim relief is to benefit both the agency and the appellant by limiting the waste of human and financial resources during the petition for review process. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 100-274, at 29 (1987); <span class="Italic">Herrin,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Ginocchi,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. at 69-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is a fundamental element of interim relief that the appellant be reinstated with pay effective as of the date of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Herrin,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Navy,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 7 (2000). However, by the time the initial decision was issued in this case, the appellant had resigned his position and transferred to another federal agency. The appellant has not alleged that his resignation was involuntary, and in any event such a claim would not lie within the scope of this IRA appeal, as he did not raise it before OSC. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert v. Department of the Interior,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 238, &#x00B6; 6 (2006). Consequently, the Board lacks the authority to order the appellant's reinstatement, on either a permanent or interim basis. Under these circumstances, the AJ should not have ordered interim relief.<span class="Italic"> Cf. Herrin,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 16 (interim relief inappropriate where appellant's term appointment had expired prior to initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant refuses to return to duty following the agency's notice for him to do so, he is owed no pay for the period that follows his declination of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bradstreet v.
