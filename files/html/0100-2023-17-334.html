<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-332"><span class="space">b.</span> Competitive Level; Duties of Union Officials</h5>
<p class="noindent">Concerning the agency's selection of a competitive level and the employee's entitlement to assignment rights, FLRA remanded an award for clarification in <span id="page_2331"></span><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 273 and Dept. of Army, Army Field Artillery Ctr., Ft. Sill</span>, 47 FLRA 294, 300-02 (1993), and in doing so, provided explanation of competitive levels:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The stipulated issue before the Arbitrator was whether the grievant was properly placed in her present position as a result of the RIF.&#x2003;In the first round of competition during a RIF employees compete within a competitive level for retention in the competitive level. During this round of competition, an employee may be released from his or her competitive level based on his or her relative retention standing. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO, NASA Headquarters Professional Association and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Headquarters, Washington, D.C.</span>, 8 FLRA 212, 213-14 (1982). Therefore, if the competitive level in which a position is abolished is limited in the positions it includes, an employee's ability to exercise rights to remain in the competitive level will also be limited. Because the grievant was placed by the Agency in a single-position competitive level, she had no other positions to compete against in the first round of the RIF, and consequently, she was released from her competitive level. Therefore, in order to reach a conclusion as to whether the assignment of the grievant was proper, the Arbitrator initially should have determined whether the grievant was properly placed in a single-position competitive level. It is in the second round of competition during a RIF that employees who have been released from their competitive levels compete for jobs in other competitive levels, at which point assignment rights, such as bumping rights, come into play. During this round of competition, the Agency offered the grievant the accounting technician position she presently holds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FPM Supplement 351-1, paragraph S3-3 provides, as noted above in footnote 2, that a competitive level consists of positions in a competitive area that are "[s]imilar enough in duties, qualification requirements...so that the incumbent of one position can successfully perform the critical elements of any other position in the level upon assignment to it, without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee." Paragraph S3-3(2) provides that "[d]eterminations are not based on the personal qualifications or performance levels of individual employees." An employee's ability to perform the duties of a specific position does not establish that the position is interchangeable with another position and belongs in the same competitive level with that position. Rather, the qualifications set forth in the official position description, not the qualifications of an employee, determine the composition of the competitive level. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Estrin v. Social Security Administration</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 303, 307 (1984). Thus, in determining whether a competitive level has been properly established for purposes of a RIF, it is necessary to compare either the official position descriptions or a detailed description of the duties required for the positions alleged to be within that competitive level. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kline v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 193 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Kline</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that there were "very clear differences" in duties between the different management analyst positions. The Arbitrator also found that the Agency made a "convincing argument" that differences in critical elements of a job would appropriately lead to different competitive levels. However, the Arbitrator noted that although critical elements were introduced as to the other GS-343-09 positions in question, none was introduced for the position formerly held by the grievant. The Arbitrator also found that there was insufficient evidence on the record for comparing critical elements. The Arbitrator did not analyze whether the grievant properly was placed in the single-position competitive level from which she was released during the first round of the RIF. Instead, he addressed the grievant's seniority as compared to the other employees in the GS-343-09 positions; the similarity of the grievant's former position to her current position; and the grievant's ability to perform the duties of the other GS-343-09 positions. None of these analyses is relevant to determining whether the Agency's placement of the grievant's position in a single-position competitive level was proper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The correct determination of whether the single-position competitive level was properly established is through either an analysis of the qualifications set forth in the position descriptions of the various management analyst positions or a close examination of the duties performed in those positions. <span class="Italic">See generally</span>, <span class="Italic">Kline</span>. Because the Arbitrator did not follow the requirements of the FPM in addressing this issue, we cannot determine what result the Arbitrator would have reached had he applied the proper analysis. Accordingly, we will remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator to clarify the basis for his award, consistent with this decision....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 54 FLRA 1099, 1104-07 (1998), decided that, following MSPB precedent, competitive level determinations are ordinarily made on the basis of position descriptions. Unless there is a provision in a negotiated agreement establishing separate competitive levels for union officials, if an employee on 100% official time as a union official holds a position description that describes duties other than those union responsibilities, the position description, and not the actual daily work of the employee, defines the competitive level:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.403(a)(2) requires that competitive level determinations be based on each employee's "official position, not the employee's personal qualifications." Though the term "position" is not defined in the regulation, section 351.403(a)(1) refers to "positions in a competitive area which are in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series[.]" This incorporates by reference the Classification Act, which defines the term "position" as "the work, consisting of the duties and responsibilities, assignable to [the] employee[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5102(a)(3). Sections 5106 and 5107 of the Classification Act also require positions to be classified in series in accordance with OPM standards. Applying the statutory definition, it is clear that the term "official position" refers to properly classified government work, not to union official duties. Thus, the grievant's "official position" would be the job embodied in his position description. Here, as the grievant's "official position" was sheet metal worker, the determination of the grievant's competitive level had to be based on that position, and not on the grievant's status as a union representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Authority and the MSPB have consistently held that competitive levels are to be established with reference to an employee's official duties as set out in his or her position description.[4] The Authority has applied this principle in cases where an employee's competitive level is in dispute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Metal Trades Council, Portsmouth</span>, 53 FLRA at 1158 (the qualifications set forth in the official position description, not the qualifications of an employee, determine the composition of the competitive level); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia and International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 1</span>, 49 FLRA 588, 593 (1994) (under applicable law and regulation, an employee's competitive level for purposes of determining that employee's rights in a RIF is based on the qualifications set forth in the employee's official position description, not the employee's skills or abilities).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;For purposes of this decision, and consistent with, among others, our recent decisions in <span class="Italic">Tidewater Virginia Federal Employees, Metal Trades Council and U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia</span>, 53 FLRA 1149, 1157 n.6 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Metal Trades Council, Portsmouth</span>), <span class="Italic">citing</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 273 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Field Artillery Center, Fort Sill, Oklahoma</span>, 47 FLRA 294, 301 (1993) and <span class="Italic">BIA Council</span>, 53 FLRA at 992, we examine and apply MSPB precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MSPB has observed a similar rule in reviewing agency determinations setting competitive levels.&#x2003;Specifically, the MSPB has held that when an employee is detailed to or acting in a position, his competitive level is determined by his permanent position, and not the one to which he is detailed or in which he is acting. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jicha v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 73, 77 (1994) (the competitive level in which an employee is placed is determined by the duties and qualifications required of the incumbent, as set forth in the official position description); <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 561, 563 (1994) (an employee's competitive level in a RIF is based on his official position of record). Here, the grievant was "acting" as one of the Union's full-time representatives in 100% official time status pursuant to section 4.13 of the parties' agreement (albeit for a number of years, in excess of what a detail would be). Nonetheless, the grievant's underlying position as sheet metal worker did not change. Therefore, as the Arbitrator did not rely on the grievant's official position, as embodied by his official position description, to determine the grievant's competitive level, the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.403(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of the Arbitrator's conclusions, the Union makes two contentions. First, relying on MSPB case law, the Union claims that the Arbitrator correctly found that the Agency could not rely solely on the grievant's official position description to determine his competitive level, but needed to consider the grievant's actual duties and qualifications. Second, the Union asserts that the parties' agreement prohibited the Agency from ignoring the grievant's 100% official time status, based on the holding of <span class="Italic">Smith v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 381 F. Supp. 888, 891 (M.D. Tenn. 1974) (<span class="Italic">Smith</span>). However, the Union has misconstrued relevant MSPB precedent and relied on a federal court decision which is distinguishable from this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first contention, the Union cites <span class="Italic">Disney v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 563, 568 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Disney</span>), in which the MSPB determined that additional evidence could be considered to determine an employee's competitive level. However, in <span class="Italic">Disney</span>, the MSPB relied on <span class="Italic">Simonton v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 30 (1994), which made clear that additional evidence may be considered, "but only to the extent that such evidence is material and relevant to an understanding of the appropriate <span class="Italic">position descriptions</span>, critical elements and performance standards." 62 MSPR at 36 (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Pigford v. Department of the Interior</span>, 75 MSPR 250, 254 (1997) ("[a]n administrative judge thus may allow testimony regarding the actual duties performed in the positions in question to the extent that it is relevant and material to an understanding of the appropriate position descriptions, critical elements and performance standards"). In short, the MSPB precedent does not allow <span id="page_2332"></span>the Agency to disregard the prescribed duties set out in the grievant's position description. Instead, and contrary to the Union's assertion, evidence regarding the grievant's actual duties is only permitted to clarify or modify the grievant's official position description.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second contention, the Union cites <span class="Italic">Smith</span> for the proposition that the parties' agreement prohibited the Agency from ignoring the grievant's 100% official time status when determining his competitive level. In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the parties' agreement specifically provided that a union steward was to be placed in a separate competitive level from other employees in the same classification. 381 F. Supp. at 890 (excerpt provided by the court of section H-VIII of the parties' agreement stated "TVA considers the job steward in a separate competitive level from the other employees in the same classification").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Bess and Roberson v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 19 MSPR 428 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Bess</span>), the MSPB also approved the TVA's establishment of a separate competitive level for union representatives. In that case, the parties' agreement stated "[a] position of job steward is not interchangeable with other positions in the same classification....&#8197;Therefore...a shift job steward of the craft is excluded from comparison...." <span class="Italic">Bess</span>, 19 MSPR at 429 n.2. The Board said this agreement provision represented "guiding principles and established nondiscretionary policy" under which agencies operate, and thus had the "effect of regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 430 n.2. Therefore, the Board held it would "enforce rights derived from" such a negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In both <span class="Italic">Smith</span> and <span class="Italic">Bess</span>, the parties' agreements specifically stated that union stewards were not to be placed in the same competitive levels as their permanent official positions would dictate. That is not the case here. The parties' agreement in this case speaks only to the authorization of official time, not the effect that status would have on the competitive level of individual union members chosen by the Union to be representatives. Section 4.13 of the parties' agreement addresses "official time" as provided for in section 7131 of the Statute and as was enforced in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 214</span> with regard to a similar "official time" agreement provision. Section 4.13 does not address or specifically provide separate competitive levels for union representatives as <span class="Italic">Smith</span> and <span class="Italic">Bess</span> did. As this case does not involve a contract provision which specifically authorizes separate competitive levels for union representatives, <span class="Italic">Smith</span> and <span class="Italic">Bess</span> do not apply. For that reason, we do not give section 4.13 the application suggested in the Union's contentions.</p>

Rucker and AFGE Local 1815</span>, 49 FLRA 454, 459 (1994), declined to set aside an award denying a grievance alleging a violation of the former FPM through creation of competitive levels for firefighters.
