<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-203"><span class="space">6.</span> Exclusion of Particular Representative</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, OIA and AFGE Local 709</span>, 54 FLRA 1502, 1505-15 (1998), addressed exclusion of a particular representative from an investigatory interview. To exclude a representative, the agency must prove the existence of "special circumstances":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute--Codifying the Right of Federal Employees to Union Representation During an Investigatory Examination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, an exclusive representative "shall be given the opportunity to be represented at any examination" of a unit employee by an agency representative in connection with an investigation, if the employee reasonably believes that discipline may result from the examination and requests representation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). The legislative history demonstrates that this statutory requirement is intended to provide rights to Federal sector bargaining unit employees consistent with those provided in the private sector by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in interpreting and applying <span id="Page_1446"></span>the National Labor Relations Act and the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 124 Cong. Rec. 29,184 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> <span class="Italic">Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong.</span>, <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span>, at 926 (1979) (Congressman Udall explained that the purpose of the House bill provisions which led to the enactment of section 7114(a)(2)(B) was to reflect the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. v. FLRA</span>, 671 F.2d 560, 563 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc.--Establishing the Right to Representation During an Investigatory Interview</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, the Supreme Court held that an employer's denial of an employee's request for union representation during an investigatory interview which the employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action interfered with, restrained, and coerced the employee's right to engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. <span class="Italic">See</span> 420 U.S. at 267. The Court stated that an employee who is questioned during an investigatory examination that may result in discipline "may be too fearful or inarticulate to relate accurately the incident being investigated, or too ignorant to raise extenuating factors," and that union representation would allay such fears and elicit useful information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 263. The Court also stated that an exclusive representative protects "the interests of the entire bargaining unit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 260-61. A union representative present at an investigatory examination is able to exercise "vigilance to make certain that the employer does not initiate or continue a practice of imposing punishment unjustly." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At the same time, the Court recognized that the right of an employee to be represented during investigatory interviews "may not interfere with legitimate employer prerogatives." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 258. The Court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The employer has no obligation to justify his refusal to allow union representation, and despite refusal, the employer is free to carry on his inquiry without interviewing the employee, and thus leave to the employee the choice between having an interview unaccompanied by his representative, or having no interview and forgoing any benefits that might be derived from one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span> the Authority held that the agency was justified, in order "to preserve the integrity of [its] investigation," in refusing to accept as the union's designated representative an unexamined subject of the same investigation. 25 FLRA at 211. However, the Authority found that the respondent was not justified in refusing to accept as the union's designated representative an examined subject of the same investigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> The Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]o preserve the integrity of the investigation, individuals who were to be investigated could not serve as representatives of other employees being investigated until their own investigations had been completed. Consequently, the Judge found that the Respondent had violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) only in those instances where the Respondent had refused to permit designated representatives, whose examinations had been completed, to represent employees to be examined....</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 211-212.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel and the Respondents disagree on <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span>'s holding. The General Counsel contends that <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span> stands for the proposition that an agency may preclude a subject from acting as the union's designated representative only until that individual has been examined. The Respondents, however, argue that the principle of <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span> is that a subject cannot serve as a representative until the entire investigation is complete. The General Counsel also argues that, because the Union has a right to designate its representative, <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span> places the burden on a respondent to show that the designated representative poses a threat to the integrity of the investigation. The Respondents, however, argue that <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span> does not create any such burden, and that, throughout the entire examination, a subject has an interest that conflicts with the duties of a union representative. The Respondents also argue that a subject serving as a representative presents an inherent threat to the integrity of the investigation, and there should be no burden on a respondent to justify the objection to the subject as a representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span> does not fully explain how an unexamined witness serving as a representative poses a threat to the integrity of the investigation, or how examination alleviates that threat. Additionally, to the extent that <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span> draws a line after a designated representative has been examined as a witness, the line is subject to manipulation. For example, if an individual may serve as a union's representative after that individual's examination is complete, then an agency could delay examining that individual until all other interviews were completed, effectively preventing the union from ever using that individual as its representative. Because of <span class="Italic">FCI, Petersburg</span>'s lack of clarity and the potential for manipulation, we take this opportunity to clarify the analytical framework for determining whether an agency can preclude a particular individual from serving as a designated representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Where "Special Circumstances" are Shown, an Agency Can Preclude a Particular Individual from Serving as a Union's Designated Representative During a Weingarten Examination</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, an exclusive representative "shall be given the opportunity to be represented at any examination" of a unit employee by an agency representative in connection with an investigation, if the employee reasonably believes that discipline may result from the examination and requests representation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). Moreover, the Authority has held that an exclusive representative has the right to designate its representatives when fulfilling its responsibilities under the Statute, and an agency violates section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute when it refuses to honor the union's designation of a representative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Food and Drug Administration, Newark District Office, West Orange, New Jersey</span>, 47 FLRA 535, 566 (1993). However, a union's representational rights under section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute are not without qualification. For example, a union may not interfere with an employer's legitimate interest and prerogative in achieving the objective of the examination or compromise its integrity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, New England Region, Burlington, Massachusetts and National Association of Air Traffic Specialist</span>, 35 FLRA 645, 652 (1990). In addition the Authority has held that section 7114(a)(2)(B) does not create a <span class="Italic">per se</span> right for an employee and the union's representative to confer outside of an examination room during a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Washington, D.C. and Phoenix, Arizona and Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno, Oklahoma</span>, 52 FLRA 421, 435, 438-39 (1996) (Member Wasserman, dissenting). Another limitation on section 7114(a)(2)(B) rights was recognized in <span class="Italic">U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, New York District Office, New York, New York and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 197</span>, 46 FLRA 1210, 1223 (1993) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>) <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 22 F.3d 1184 (D.C. Cir. 1994), where the Authority held that it was not an unfair labor practice for a respondent to proceed with investigatory interviews where the union's president and vice president--its designated <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> representatives--were out of town on union business and unavailable to represent employees through no fault of the respondent. The Authority's approach in these cases is consistent with the Supreme Court's recognition of the need to "strik[e] a balance between an employer's legitimate interests and prerogatives in investigating and disciplining misconduct[,] and the right of an employee to have the 'assistance of his union representative at a confrontation with his employer.'" 46 FLRA at 1218 (citing <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 260).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the NLRB has recognized that the right to representation under <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> is not unfettered. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">New Jersey Bell Telephone Co. and Local 827, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO</span>, 308 NLRB 277, 282 (1992) (<span class="Italic">New Jersey Bell</span>) (allowing an employer to preclude a witness to the incident under investigation from serving as the union's representative because the employer demonstrated "special circumstances" warranting preclusion; specifically, because of the designated individual's obstructive behavior during an earlier <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination and the individual's trespassing on the employer's property); <span class="Italic">Pacific Gas &#x0026; Electric Co. and Joseph C. Green</span>, 253 NLRB 1143, 1143 (1981) (holding that an employee may not insist on the representation of an off-site union representative who is not readily available when the assistance of another union representative, who is on-site, is readily available); <span class="Italic">Roadway Express, Inc. and Van Drake and Edward Bailey</span>, 246 NLRB 1127, 1129 (1979) (holding that <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> does not "state or suggest that an employee's interest can only be safeguarded by the presence of a <span class="Italic">specific</span> representative sought by the employee, as opposed to being accompanied by <span class="Italic">any</span> union representative"; in particular, that an employee under investigation cannot insist on representation from an off-site representative when an on-site representative is available); <span class="Italic">Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los Angeles and International Association of Machinists &#x0026; Aerospace Workers District Lodge 94, Local Lodge 1186, AFL-CIO</span>, 227 NLRB 1276, 1276 (1977) (holding that an employer is not required to postpone examinations because a shop steward is unavailable--for personal or other reasons for which the employer is not responsible--where another union representative is available to act as a representative).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To effectuate an agency's legitimate concerns regarding the integrity of its investigation and the union's right to designate the representatives for purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, it is necessary to accommodate these interests. Our framework of accommodation is governed by the presumption that a union can designate the individual it wants as its representative during a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination, pursuant to section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. By adopting this presumption, we continue to recognize the agency's interest in preserving the integrity <span id="Page_1447"></span>of its investigation. Therefore, an agency can rebut this presumption. We hold that an agency may preclude a particular individual from serving as the union's designated representative only where the agency can demonstrate "special circumstances" that warrant precluding a particular individual from serving in this capacity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">New Jersey Bell</span>, 308 NLRB at 282. "Special circumstances" will, consistent with its application in the private sector, be construed narrowly to preserve the union's normal prerogatives. We emphasize, in addition, that even if an agency can demonstrate such special circumstances, a union nonetheless may exercise its right of representation by designating another individual to serve as a representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Respondents did Not Show Special Circumstances that Warrant Precluding the Chief Steward from Serving as the Union's Representative</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Starting with the presumption stated above, the Union had the right to designate the chief steward as its representative during the Union president's <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination. To rebut this presumption, and preclude the chief steward from serving as the representative, the Respondents need to demonstrate special circumstances warranting preclusion. Here, the Respondents did not demonstrate special circumstances. As discussed below, the mere fact that the chief steward was a witness to the incident under investigation alone is not enough to warrant precluding her from serving as the Union's representative, because the Respondents have not shown how permitting the chief steward to serve as the Union's representative harms the integrity of its investigation. The Respondents have not raised any other arguments or facts that explain why the chief steward should be precluded from serving as the Union's representative. Accordingly, we affirm the Judge's conclusion that the Respondent violated the Statute by interfering with the Union's section 7114(a)(2)(B) right, and deny the Respondents' exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents urge adoption of a rule that absolutely prohibits a witness to an incident under investigation from serving as a union's representative during a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination. The Respondents made several arguments in support of this rule, each of which we address below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents' first argument in support of the absolute prohibition is that allowing the witness to serve as the Union's representative increases the likelihood that the witness would break her pledge not to discuss the issues raised during the witness's interview. We reject this argument because a witness's opportunity to violate his or her oath during the time between his or her interview and an interview in which he or she serves as the union's representative is the same regardless of his or her status as a representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents' second argument in support of the absolute prohibition is that there is an inherent conflict between the "function" of a representative and that of a witness, a conflict that increases the probability of collusion. We disagree. The function of a witness is to recount events; the function of a representative is to protect and monitor the examinee's and the bargaining unit's rights and interests. We see no conflict between the former and the latter. The opportunity to collude is not necessarily increased by allowing the witness to serve as the union's representative. As the Judge stated, had the union representative and the examinee both "been of a mind to ignore the instructions with which they were both familiar, in order to collude, they would not have needed [the witness'] participation as the union representative at [the examinee's] interview to enable them." Similarly, the Respondents assert that it is unwise to expect an employee to perform the conflicting functions of witness and union representative, citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 38 FLRA 1300 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>) in support of the proposition that a union representative cannot be compelled to divulge the confidential statements of an employee under investigation. However, <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> holds only that a representative may not be compelled to divulge information learned in the course of representation, and does not limit the duty of a witness to reveal what he or she witnessed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 38 FLRA at 1308-09.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents' third argument in support of an absolute prohibition against allowing a witness to serve as a representative is that new information might appear, requiring reexamination of the witness. As the Judge notes, however, the possibility of reexamination exists in any situation, and the possibility of it arising in a situation such as this does not increase the likelihood of a witness changing her testimony. If the chief steward offered different or contradictory testimony, presumably the Respondents could have impeached the chief steward's testimony with her earlier statement or with the statements of the other two witnesses to the incident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondents, relying on <span class="Italic">Bell</span>, 441 U.S. at 520, argue that determining whether something affects the integrity of an investigation is an agency's internal security matter, and that deference should be shown to the Respondents in deciding to preclude a witness from serving as a representative. We disagree. <span class="Italic">Bell</span> concerned the constitutionality of housing and security rules as they pertained to pre-trial inmates, and did not concern the labor and employment rights of correctional employees. Accordingly, we reject the Respondents' argument as to the applicability of <span class="Italic">Bell</span> here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Respondent violated the Statute by interfering with the Union's section 7114(a)(2)(B) right, because the Respondents did not demonstrate special circumstances that warrant precluding the chief steward from serving as the Union's representative. Therefore, we deny the Respondents' exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">A conflict sufficient to warrant exclusion of a representative occurred when the representative was under investigation in a matter closely related to the subject matter of the investigation of the employee who sought that representative's assistance, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 116</span>, 57 FLRA 319, 322-23 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority has held, as a general matter, that a union has the right to designate the individual representative for an examination under this section, and that an agency violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute when it refuses to honor the union's designation of its representative. <span class="Italic">FCI, Englewood, </span>54 FLRA at 1502-03. Nevertheless, a union's presumptive right to designate a particular representative for an investigatory examination may be overcome if the agency establishes special circumstances that warrant precluding a particular individual from serving as a representative. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 54 FLRA at 1513 (<span class="Italic">citing New Jersey Bell Tel. Co.</span>, 308 NLRB 277, 282 (1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FCI, Englewood, </span>the Authority determined that the fact that the designated representative was also a witness to the events that were the subject of the investigation did not, standing alone, establish special circumstances that warranted precluding that individual from serving as a representative. 54 FLRA at 1513-14. The Authority rejected the agency's claims that permitting a witness to serve as a representative would increase the likelihood that the representative would break a pledge of confidentiality, that there was an inherent conflict between the function of a witness and that of a representative, and that such an individual could not be reexamined in the event new information was discovered. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1514-15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike <span class="Italic">FCI, Englewood</span>, the designated representative in this case was not merely a witness to the events at issue, she was the subject of the investigation. The Judge found that the potential conflict of interest presented by this situation was a special circumstance that permitted the Respondents to preclude her from representing the employee. The Judge also found that if the allegation against the Union vice president was true, then the employee would be less likely to provide true, full, and complete answers to questions, thereby harming the integrity of the investigation. <span class="Italic">See FCI, Englewood, </span>54 FLRA at 1511 (specific representative may be precluded where presence would compromise the integrity of the investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Judge did not err in finding that there was a potential conflict of interest in permitting the Union vice president to represent the employee, sufficient to establish special circumstances justifying the Respondents' refusal to permit her to act in this capacity. In this regard, the subject of an investigation, unlike a witness, has a direct stake in the outcome of the investigation. In this case, for example, if the Union vice president had, in fact, advised the employee to lie as part of an official investigation, then it is reasonable to conclude that the Union vice president would have an interest in preventing the Agency from establishing her culpability. This interest is distinct from, and might conflict with, the vice president's obligation to advise the employee in a manner that protects the employee's interests. We conclude that these potentially divergent and competing interests posed a potential of harm to the integrity of the investigation that was sufficient to overcome the presumption that the Union may select the representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC asserts that the special agent's decision to preclude the Union representative was not based on special circumstances. Instead, according to the GC, the decision to preclude the Union representative was based on the special agent's own convenience. The GC relies, in this regard, on the special agent's testimony that she could have limited the preclusion to those few questions that related to the allegation against the vice president, and allowed the vice president to represent the employee for the remainder of the examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This argument--that the Respondents should have split the examination in two--has no support in the wording of the Statute or in case law. With respect to the former, nothing in the Statute requires that an employee be permitted separate representatives for separate lines of questioning. With respect to the latter, case law establishes that employers are granted latitude in determining the form and timing of examinations, especially in situations where alternative representatives are available and the unavailability of a designated representative is not the fault of the employer. <span class="Italic">See</span> 54 FLRA at 1511-13....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing precedent, there is no basis to find a <span id="Page_1448"></span>violation of the Statute based on Respondents' failure to restructure the examination in such a way that the vice president could represent the employee as to some, but not all, matters under investigation. We note, in this connection, that with the exception of the Union vice president, the Respondents did not seek to designate a representative for the Union, or otherwise restrict the Union's choice of representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the GC has not established that the Respondents' failure to initiate an official investigation into the allegations against the Union vice president demonstrates that no special circumstances warranted excluding her from the examination. We find no basis to conclude that the Respondents were required to undertake a particular <span class="Italic">type</span> of investigation.</p>
