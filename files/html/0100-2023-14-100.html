<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-98"><span class="space">a.</span> Ineffectiveness as Supervisor; Demotion</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">People are often promoted to supervisory or managerial positions based on technical expertise, not on ability to manage people or programs. In the appeal of a manager or a supervisor, it may be that the employee is a perfectly satisfactory journeyman but he is not performing well in a position that requires managerial or supervisory skills or in a position that requires a high degree of trust. To avoid the waste that would follow wholesale removal of individuals whose skills, other than managerial, are good, the Board occasionally substitutes demotion to retain the services of the employee. If an employee fails to function properly as a manager, essentially a performance problem, assuming the application of Chapter 75 standards, mitigation factors under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> apply. If the agency demotes the individual to a nonsupervisory position, it should be to the highest grade that the appellant can effectively fill. The mitigation factors applicable include deficiencies in the work as a supervisor, the appellant's previous performance at other grades, and length of service. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 487, 491 &#x00B6; 9 (1998) ("While the appellant may be unsuitable to perform in a supervisory position, the record does not establish that he is unsuitable to perform in a nonsupervisory position[.] "); <span class="Italic">Fischer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 69 MSPR 614, 619 (1996) (demotion of a senior customs inspector to nonsupervisory position: "Such a penalty takes into account the appellant's unblemished past record and the relatively minor nature of the charges while at the same time acknowledging that those charges call into question his ability to act in a supervisory role."); <span class="Italic">Hatler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 724, 728, 6 MSPB 605 (1981) (demotion from GS-9 to GS-5 was remanded for reconsideration). An agency need not necessarily charge or prove intent to sustain an action based upon ineffectiveness of a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Crouse v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 75 MSPR 57, 63 (1997) [Refer to <span class="Italic">Fischer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 97 MSPR 546, 549-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16 (2004), and discussion in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-164.html#sec16-162">Demotion</a>," concerning procedures for implementing Board orders mitigating penalties to demotions.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a supervisor fails to perform supervisory functions properly, but there is no personal gain or criminal misconduct and there is a clean record of 12 years of service, the appropriate penalty is not removal but demotion to the next lower nonsupervisory grade, for the employee could be expected to perform in a fully satisfactory manner free of managerial responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Rasmussen v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 245, 248-49, 7 MSPB 149 (1981). Downgrading to a nonsupervisory position, rather than removal, was appropriate for an employee who allowed subordinates to engage in preferential treatment of persons seeking grants, but who did not personally benefit from the actions of the subordinates. The supervisor had an otherwise good service record and less than all the charges against the supervisor were sustained. 8 MSPR 249, 256, 7 MSPB 713 (1981). A manager may be demoted, although he is not unfit to serve or supervise, for a group of offenses, each not amounting to a serious offense, but all cumulatively supporting a demotion out of a managerial position requiring, in the agency's words, an "exemplary level of responsibility." <span class="Italic">See DiPaolo v. USPS</span>, 356 Fed. Appx. 405, 409 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Neilon v. USPS</span>, DA-0752-14-0081-I-1 n.3 (NP 1/21/2015) ("The principle that supervisors and those with fiduciary responsibilities are held to higher standards of conduct applies to postmasters inasmuch as they are both. <span class="Italic">See Stack v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 9 (2006); <span class="Italic">see also Stuhlmacher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 272, &#x00B6; 25 (2001)."); <span class="Italic">Spencer v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-12-0756-I-1 (NP 2/14/2014) ("The Board has found that a demotion may be appropriate when even relatively minor sustained charges call into question an appellant's ability to act in their supervisory role.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an employee charged with misuse of a government credit card, it was appropriate to reduce the removal to demotion to a nonsupervisory position. The employee, who had an exemplary work record, could still function as an employee but could not be trusted to monitor credit card use by subordinates if he remained in a supervisory position. The Board considered that the appellant did not accrue any financial gain through his conduct, that he was not specifically on notice that his conduct was in violation of agency regulations, and that his supervisor felt that the offense would not occur again. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 15 MSPR 731, 736-37 (1983). Demotion to a nonsupervisory position was appropriate for conduct inconsistent with supervisory duties in <span class="Italic">Ramseur v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 104, 107 (1983) (involving charges that the employee failed to carry out the duties of a supervisor and that he made false statements about an employee). <span class="Italic">See Simpkins v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 603, 606-07 &#x00B6; 8 (1998) (modifying the AJ's mitigation, from demotion to suspension, to demotion to a nonsupervisory position because appellant's performance deficiencies, as well as prior disciplinary actions, reflected negatively on her capability to act as a supervisor). Demotion was proper for a supervisor who abused leave regulations by improperly accounting for leave, causing loss of confidence in him as a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Minyard v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 229, 233 (1984). For an assistant principal with an otherwise good record who was removed because of the agency's loss of confidence in the appellant's integrity as an administrator, the appropriate remedy was demotion to the next highest grade level as a nonsupervisory teacher. This result would "resolve the agency's loss of confidence in him as an administrator." <span class="Italic">Novinsky v. DOD</span>, 33 MSPR 94, 96 (1987).

<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Each employee's work performance and disciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action should be calibrated to the specific facts and circumstances of each individual employee's situation. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time--particularly where the employees are in different work units or chains of supervision--and agencies are not prohibited from removing an employee simply because they did not remove a different employee for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees should be treated equitably, so agencies should consider appropriate comparators as they evaluate potential disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Suspension should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate. Agencies should not require suspension of an employee before proposing to remove that employee, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;When taking disciplinary action, agencies should have discretion to take into account an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all past misconduct--not only similar past misconduct.

<p class="Body-Text">Not all supervisory misconduct results in demotion. The Board directed a mitigated penalty of suspension for a supervisor who made an inappropriate suggestion to a contractor's employee; because the suggestion was not made in front of the appellant's subordinates, the misconduct did not destroy the appellant's ability to supervise. <span class="Italic">See Erickson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 63 MSPR 80, 84 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Dearsman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 16 MSPR 631, 638 (1983), involving willful failure by a GS-15 to follow instructions, the Board changed a demotion to a 60-day suspension. The failure to follow instructions did not relate to the appellant's supervisory responsibilities, nor was it shown that it prejudiced the continued performance of the employee's duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bearing in mind the admonition of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> and the Federal Personnel Manual provisions cited therein that agency imposed discipline should seek to be rehabilitative, the Board concludes that the maximum reasonable penalty in this case was a 60-day suspension. Such an action would have severe financial impact on appellant, would suffice to impress upon appellant the seriousness of her conduct and would in all probability assure that such conduct would not be repeated in the future. It would also have satisfied the agency's concerns that the discipline of appellant provide a prophylactic warning to employees similarly situated....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gunn v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 513, 518-20 (1994), mitigated to a short suspension the demotion of a distribution operations supervisor who signed a leave slip for another employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although falsification is a serious offense that affects the employee's reliability, veracity, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct, there is no <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule regarding the penalty to be imposed in a falsification case; rather, the total circumstances surrounding the misconduct should be examined.... Here, the deciding official did not consider the circumstances of the falsification, but selected a penalty based on the simple fact that a falsification occurred. When these and other mitigating circumstances are considered, the agency's penalty exceeds the bounds of reasonableness....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant falsified another employee's leave slip without any benefit or personal gain. The appellant attempted to keep another employee, albeit a friend, from having additional leave problems in a situation where the employee called in for the leave sufficiently in advance to try to avoid such a problem. The appellant could have avoided the charged misconduct by initialing the leave slip next to the employee's signature to indicate that she did, in fact, sign for him. The appellant, however, chose the worst of the options available to her.... Other than potential damage to her own reputation, the agency did not suffer from the appellant's misconduct; the employee took the requested leave, which the agency had approved. We therefore agree with the administrative judge's characterization of the appellant's offense as a "technical" falsification that is similar in nature to a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theft....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that, when asked on cross-examination if he would be surprised to learn that another postal manager wanted the appellant to work for him in a supervisory position, the deciding official admitted that he would not be surprised because the appellant had excellent potential for rehabilitation. This testimony contradicts the deciding official's statement that the appellant could not remain as a supervisor, and further shows that the deciding official did not responsibly balance the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Rather, the deciding official merely parroted a select number of factors that he believed would justify his action, thus failing to prove the facts underlying his rationale for the demotion. <span class="Italic">See Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 318 ("an agency will risk having its selected penalty reduced, if it does not meet its burden of proof on the underlying factual issues").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the evidence discussed above, the record reflects that, during the appellant's 28 years of service with the agency, she received good performance ratings and never faced any form of disciplinary action. When the total circumstances surrounding the charge are considered, including the deciding official's testimony regarding the appellant's potential for rehabilitation and the appellant's lengthy exemplary career, it is clear that the appellant has excellent potential for rehabilitation and that the selected penalty exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. We find this to be true even in consideration of the appellant's position as a supervisor.... Although the deciding official did reduce the penalty that had been initially proposed, we find that such a reduction does not, in and of itself, evidence a responsible balancing of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Johnson v. SBA</span>, 97 MSPR 571, 590 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 40-41 (2004) (mitigating demotion to suspension: "We also note that the appellant held a high-level, supervisory position, and that, although he does not appear to have been responsible for the enforcement of travel regulations and procedures, he was employed in an office with that enforcement responsibility. As Mr. Walter noted in instructing the appellant to submit his overdue vouchers, such an office 'cannot enforce travel rules that call for timely submission of vouchers and not have [its] own employees (especially a senior manager) not following [its] own rules.' We note further, however, that the appellant's delay in filing his vouchers evidently did not cause actual, significant harm to the agency. Mr. Wilson indicated that any problem caused by the delay was not serious because the agency's travel expenses were very small in proportion to other expenses.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To offer examples of demotions reduced to suspensions does not suggest exclusion of removal for supervisory misconduct. An argument for mitigation of a penalty through rehabilitation or progressive discipline is weakened if the offending conduct ceased when the employee learned that disciplinary action was imminent and the employee was a supervisor who could be expected to know and follow a higher standard of conduct than that of a regular line employee. <span class="Italic">See Crostic v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-886) (employee engaged in outside business during working hours). If an agency demonstrates through testimony of managers or supervisors that trust was lost in an appellant as a result of the charged conduct, the Board will not discredit the agency's position because the agency allows the employee to continue in his supervisory position during the time up to and through his hearing or during a period of interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Fletcher v. USDA</span>, 63 MSPR 165, 170 n.5 (1994). Removal was appropriate of a supervisor who ignored evidence that subordinates' misconduct jeopardized a project. <span class="Italic">Thorne v. TVA</span>, 18 MSPR 514, 516 (1984). Removal of a supervisory law enforcement officer was sustained for inappropriate comments to a female subordinate, coupled with past discipline. <span class="Italic">See Ferris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-14-0818-I-1 (NP 8/31/2015) ("The administrative judge noted the deciding official considered that the appellant was disciplined for similar misconduct during the previous year, <span class="Italic">see Zwagil v. General Services Administration</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 63, &#x00B6; 9 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 227 F. App'x 923 (Fed. Cir. 2007), expressing his concern that such behavior suggested a trend, and that, as a supervisory law enforcement officer, the appellant has a direct impact on his subordinates and must provide guidance and set a professional example; <span class="Italic">see Luongo v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 643, &#x00B6; 13 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 123 F. App'x 405 (Fed. Cir. 2005).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Supervisory misconduct may sustain termination. Removal was upheld of a GS-10 Supervisory Tax Examining Assistant who received an emergency salary payment of $479, then received her full paycheck, then failed to repay the emergency salary. The agency acted against the employee within two months of the time it was "certain that the appellant had committed the offense of theft," and the employee was in a position of trust. <span class="Italic">Jiggetts v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 48 MSPR 252, 256 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 35, &#x00B6; 21 (2022) ("It is particularly noteworthy that the appellant directed his inappropriate comments towards his subordinates, over whom he possessed supervisory power, thus violating the authority the agency vested in him as a supervisor."); <span class="Italic">Cook v. VA</span>, 9 MSPR 392, 394 (1981) (offense of theft "was more egregious here since appellant was a supervisor," <span class="Italic">quoting Cafferello v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 625 F.2d 285 (9th Cir. 1980), "illegal activities, when engaged in by a supervisor may encourage like disobedience by the employees, and, additionally, compromise the supervisor's ability to discipline similar transgressions by subordinates.").</p>

Dept. of Interior</span>, 115 MSPR 474, 477-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2010 MSPB 252 (2010), determined that the agency deciding official considered but rejected demotion because of the appellant's difficulty getting along with other employees, along with other factors.</p>
