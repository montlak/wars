<p class="noindent">FLRA may decline to permit withdrawal of a unit clarification petition, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 70 FLRA 452, 452-53 (2018) (Member Abbott concurring; Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 70 FLRA 953 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting),<span class="Italic"> post</span>), review denied for lack of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span> (D.D.C. <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20190802d58">No. 19-142</a> Aug. 2, 2019)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its December 15, 2017 order, the Authority stated that, upon "preliminary review of the record," it had concluded that "the Agency's application raise[d] issues that warrant[ed] further review." On January 4, 2018, the Union submitted a request to withdraw its petition. Then, on January 11, 2018, the Union filed a "[n]otice of [w]ithdrawal," in which it asserts that it has withdrawn its petition. As nothing in the Authority's Regulations permits the Union to withdraw its petition at this late stage of the proceeding, the Authority will exercise its discretion to decide whether to approve the Union's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the unfair-labor-practice (ULP) context, a charging party may not unilaterally withdraw its charge without FLRA approval.[7] And, once the FLRA's General Counsel has issued a complaint in a ULP case, certain settlement agreements are "subject to approval by the Authority."[8] While the ULP process differs from the representation process, it demonstrates that once a proceeding has reached a certain stage, the FLRA has institutional interests in resolving the dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.10(a)(1) (stating that an RD, on behalf of the General Counsel, may "[a]pprove a request to withdraw a charge").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2423.25(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the FLRA has spent considerable time and resources attempting to resolve the parties' dispute. The Union filed its petition nearly two years ago, on April 27, 2016. In that time, the FLRA's Washington Regional Office, including the RD, led an investigation, held a hearing, assessed evidence, conducted research, and issued a decision on the merits of the parties' dispute. More recently, the Authority processed the Agency's application, reviewed the legal and factual issues presented on appeal, and notified the parties that the application raised legal issues that warranted further review. The Union does not provide any reason why now, after all this time, it seeks to withdraw its petition. And, after nearly two years, it would be inappropriate to allow the Union to withdraw its petition, without reason, right before resolution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that it was the Agency--not the Union--that brought this dispute to the Authority by filing an application for review. And the Agency has not indicated any desire to withdraw from this proceeding.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, ICE, Nat'l Council 118</span>, 70 FLRA 441, 441 (2018) (granting union's request to withdraw negotiability petition where agency effectively agreed with union's request, contingent on the Authority vacating the underlying decisions at issue).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Authority has an obligation that extends beyond the parties in this case. Congress charged the Authority with "provid[ing] leadership in establishing policies and guidance" in matters that include "determin[ing] the appropriateness" of bargaining units.[12] As described more fully below, a bargaining unit cannot properly include a "confidential employee" under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(2) of the Statute. By issuing a decision that resolves the parties' dispute, the Authority expands its precedent in this area, which, in turn, assists others in the labor-management community in determining whether their bargaining units are appropriate under law and saves future government and union resources by preventing duplicative disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent asserts that we are improperly engaging in rulemaking, as opposed to adjudication, by issuing a decision that will "assist[&#8197;] others" in the labor-management community. We disagree. The three primary considerations in distinguishing adjudication from rulemaking are: (1) whether the government action applies to specific individuals or to unnamed and unspecified persons; (2) whether the promulgating agency considers general facts or adjudicates a particular set of disputed facts; and (3) whether the action determines policy issues or resolves specific disputes between particular parties.[15] Here, we are deciding only the dispute placed before us by the parties: whether, under the particular facts of this case, the RD failed to apply established law by finding that the specific employees at issue are not confidential. Resolution of that issue will have an immediate effect on those employees, the Union, and the Agency--all of whom will benefit from knowing the bargaining-unit status of the support-specialist and program-analyst positions.[16] Further, the fact that our decision "will assist[&#8197;] others" is immaterial; the very nature of adjudication is that it produces precedential decisions that guide the conduct of similarly situated parties.[18] Thus, our refusal to permit the Union to unilaterally terminate proceedings in this matter, and our resulting decision on the merits, does not amount to rulemaking.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that a dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a "legally cognizable interest" in the outcome.[15] The burden of demonstrating mootness is a "heavy one."[16] As relevant here, a party urging mootness meets that burden by establishing that it is "absolutely clear"[17] that "there is no reasonable expectation" that the same controversy will recur.[18] And when a dispute is moot, a decision on the merits of that dispute would constitute an advisory opinion in violation of &#x00A7; 2429.10.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the timing of the Union's withdrawal request militates against a finding of mootness. As noted above, the Union sought to withdraw the petition <span class="Italic">only after</span> the Authority informed the parties that the Agency's application raised issues that warranted consideration of the RD's decision.[20] The Union did not provide any reason it was suddenly insistent on withdrawing the petition, after nearly two years of seeking to clarify the status of the employees.[21] Even now, in its motion, the Union fails to provide a definitive rationale. As the Authority referenced in <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, we will not permit parties to utilize considerable FLRA resources and, then, in order to evade an Authority decision, withdraw before final resolution.[22] Allowing such conduct would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of mootness[23] and "the requirement [for] an effective and efficient Government."[24]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is also noteworthy that the bargaining-unit status of the employees is not rendered moot simply because the Union does not, <span class="Italic">at this time</span>, desire to represent them. The Union is still the certified, exclusive representative of a bargaining unit of Agency employees, and it fails to provide any assurance that it will not, at a later time, seek to include the employees in that unit.[25] Moreover, without an Authority determination on the bargaining-unit status of the employees, nothing in the Statute or the Authority's regulations would preclude the Union from attempting to do so. Thus, the very conduct that triggered this dispute could reasonably be expected to recur.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, under &#x00A7; 2422.2(c) of the Authority's Regulations, both unions <span class="Italic">and agencies</span> have the right to file petitions that seek to clarify the bargaining-unit status of employees.[27] Therefore, regardless of the Union's sudden disinterest in resolving the status of the employees, the Agency has a legally cognizable interest in that matter under the Authority's regulations. The Agency effectively expressed that interest by filing the application challenging the RD's decision and, again, by filing an opposition.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Given that both parties have, at some point, expressed an interest in resolving the bargaining-unit status of the employees, it is not "absolutely clear" that this dispute would not recur.[29] Therefore, and for the reasons provided above, the issue of the bargaining-unit status of the employees is not moot. And because that issue is not moot, <span class="Italic">DOL</span> does not violate &#x00A7; 2429.10's prohibition on issuing advisory opinions.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Authority acted arbitrarily and capriciously by denying the Union's request to withdraw because, in prior cases, the Authority has granted similar requests. Specifically, the Union cites <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA</span> (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>)[31] and <span class="Italic">AFGE, ICE, National Council</span> (<span class="Italic">ICE</span>).[32] However, as demonstrated below, both of those cases are distinguishable.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;70 FLRA 441 (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, the Authority--in an unpublished order--granted the union's request to withdraw its <span class="Italic">election</span> petition.[33] Unlike the clarification petition at issue here, an election petition can be filed only by a union.[34] Thus, when the union in <span class="Italic">EPA</span> sought to withdraw its petition, the agency had no legally cognizable interest in an Authority determination concerning whether an election would take place.[35] In addition, after that petition was withdrawn, the union was barred by regulation from filing a similar petition for six months[36]--making it absolutely clear that the issue raised by the petition would not recur for a set amount time. Therefore, unlike here, the facts in <span class="Italic">EPA</span> established that the issue raised by the petition had been mooted.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.2(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. DHS, Border and Transp. Sec. Directorate, Transp. Sec. Admin</span>., 59 FLRA 423, 429 (2003) (the Authority does not have the power to direct an election "for any purpose other than to determine a representative").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.14(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">ICE</span>, although the Authority granted the union's request to withdraw, it limited that holding to "circumstances...where one party has appealed a negotiability petition to court, the matter has been returned to [the Authority] without judicial pronouncement, and where <span class="Italic">both parties</span> effectively agree to a withdrawal of the underlying petition."[37] <span class="Italic">ICE</span> does not apply here, where the dispute concerns a <span class="Italic">representation</span> petition, and the parties <span class="Italic">disagree</span> as to whether the Union should be permitted to withdraw.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ICE</span>, 70 FLRA at 441 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also alleges that the Authority raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, and acted arbitrarily by considering, "the procedural history of the case, the time and resources expended by the FLRA, whether the Union stated a reason for withdrawing, and whether the Agency...agreed with the Union's request." But those are the <span class="Italic">facts and circumstances</span> of the case, and, as established above, those facts support the conclusion that the bargaining-unit status of the employees is not a moot issue. Moreover, the Authority only considered those facts (1) <span class="Italic">in response</span> to the Union filing multiple submissions concerning the withdrawal of the petition[40] and (2) to determine, in its discretion, whether to permit the Union's withdrawal request.[41] Accordingly, the Authority did not consider any issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>,[42] nor did it act arbitrarily or capriciously by addressing the applicability of the facts to the Union's request.[43]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague suggests that the Authority should ignore the facts and circumstances of the case; find the dispute moot despite the Agency's legally cognizable interest in the matter; and disregard the Union's motives for attempting to withdraw <span class="Italic">even if</span> the Union's sole motivation was to unilaterally deprive the Agency of the opportunity to have its timely-filed application for review addressed (in effect, attempting to undermine the jurisdiction of the Authority). These suggestions are simply incompatible with federal court precedent, which establishes that facts,[47] motives,[48] and parties' interests[49] <span class="Italic">are material considerations</span> when determining mootness. In addition, contrary to the dissent's assertion, the Union did have an opportunity to address the issue of mootness. In either of its two submissions in <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, the Union could have provided a rationale for, or argument in support of, its attempts to withdraw; it did not do so. The Union has now had <span class="Italic">another</span> opportunity to make arguments in its motion.

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the dissent is flat wrong when it asserts that this case is before the Authority "solely" because of the Union's petition. It was the Agency--not the Union--that filed the application for review that brought this dispute before the Authority. And the issues that we address in this case were raised by the Agency, in its application, and the Union, in its multiple requests to withdraw. Thus, the Authority did not raise any issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Union has not established that the Authority's decision in </span>DOL<span class="Italic"> constituted impermissible rulemaking.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union alleges that the Authority in <span class="Italic">DOL</span> was engaged in rulemaking in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act. Specifically, the Union contends that the Authority effectively repealed &#x00A7; 2429.10 of the Authority's Regulations by issuing an advisory opinion.

As such, <span class="Italic">DOL</span> had no effect on &#x00A7; 2429.10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as noted in <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, there are three primary considerations in distinguishing adjudication from rulemaking: (1) whether the government action applies to specific individuals or to unnamed and unspecified persons; (2) whether the promulgating agency considers general facts or adjudicates a particular set of disputed facts; and (3) whether the action determines policy issues or resolves specific disputes between particular parties.[55]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, the Authority adjudicated the merits of the dispute based on the specific facts of the case, including a hearing transcript,[56] the parties' exhibits,[57] and the RD's decision.[58] In addition, the Authority resolved only the issue before it: whether the RD failed to apply established law in concluding that the employees are not confidential employees under the Statute.[59]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">While the Union argues that <span class="Italic">DOL</span> had no effect on the parties or the employees, the decision specifically "exclude[s]" the employees from the unit as confidential employees under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute.[61] And by excluding the employees, DOL prevents the Union from simply refiling a similar petition, involving the same employees, at a later time.[62] Without <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, the bargaining-unit status of the employees would be unsettled, and the Union--or the Agency[63]--could seek an FLRA determination on that matter. Thus, contrary to the Union's argument, <span class="Italic">DOL</span> applies to specific individuals, establishing that the Authority in <span class="Italic">DOL</span> was properly engaged in adjudication.[64]</p>
