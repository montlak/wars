<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-61"><span class="space">g.</span> Irrevocable Retirement; VSIP</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Even an "irrevocable" retirement becomes involuntary if the agency improperly denies an employee's request to withdraw the retirement before its effective date, as in <span class="Italic">Aldredge v. TVA</span>, 70 MSPR 141, 146-47 (1996), involving a retirement accepted based on an offered early-out incentive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A separation pursuant to a retirement is deemed involuntary when the agency improperly denied the employee's request to withdraw his or her retirement before its effective date. <span class="Italic">See Schwartz v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 68 MSPR 142, 145 (1995); <span class="Italic">Jostsons v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 58 MSPR 74, 79 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 26 F.3d 139 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). An employee has the right to rescind a decision to retire at any time before it is to be effective, unless the agency has a valid reason for refusing to permit such rescission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b), <span class="Italic">Jostsons,</span> 58 MSPR at 79. The agency bears the burden of proving that it had such a reason. <span class="Italic">See Olsen v. Department of the Army</span>, 65 MSPR 60, 63 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has asserted that the agency refused to permit him <span id="Page_2002"></span>to withdraw his decision to retire because it viewed him as being bound by his "irrevocable" agreement. The Board has found, however, that such agreements are not necessarily irrevocable, unless the agency has an otherwise valid reason for not permitting an employee to rescind a request to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">See Wisdom v. Department of Defense,</span> 63 MSPR 333, 336 (1994). Thus, there is a question as to whether the agency had a valid reason when it apparently denied the appellant's request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in its June 9, 1995 submission below, the agency contended in Steve Moss's affidavit that it had specifically considered the impact of the appellant's departure in developing and implementing reductions in the Browns Ferry work force. Although this assertion may be relevant in determining the existence of a valid reason, the administrative judge did not address the issue, and did not advise the parties that it was an issue. Moreover, it appears that the appellant, who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, was not aware of the requirement for a valid reason under our caselaw and regulations, and thus did not specifically address it. Accordingly, we decline to resolve the matter here, particularly in light of the meager evidence in the record, and the lack of a jurisdictional hearing, and find that it is necessary to remand this appeal for this point as well as the question of whether the appellant was the victim of misinformation when he agreed to retire.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A properly structured buyout program may lead to an irrevocable election to retire if the agency demonstrates the fiscal underpinnings of the program and fairly applies any exceptions permitting rescission of the buyout election, <span class="Italic">Perrine v. GSA</span>, 81 MSPR 155, 157-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-19 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 10, 1993, President Clinton issued Executive Order No. 12839, 3 CFR 590 (1994), ordering all Executive agencies with more than 100 employees to eliminate not less than four percent of their positions over the next three fiscal years. On September 11, 1993, President Clinton issued a "Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies" instructing agency heads to submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) streamlining plans to achieve the twelve percent workforce reduction recommended by the National Performance Review. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-386, at 4 (1993), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 49, 52. On October 1, 1993, the Administration submitted to Congress a legislative proposal entitled the "Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1993," which would authorize agencies to offer separation incentive payments to encourage employees to resign or retire voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 30, 1994, Congress enacted the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (FWRA), Pub. L. No. 103-226, 108 Stat. 111 (1994). The FWRA granted certain agencies the authority to pay up to $25,000 as a voluntary separation incentive payment (VSIP or "buyout"), "to avoid or minimize the need for involuntary separations due to a reduction in force [RIF], transfer of function, or other similar action." FWRA, &#x00A7; 3(c)(2). At the same time, section 5 of the FWRA mandated specific reductions in full-time equivalent (FTE) positions, and set forth the mechanism to enforce such reductions, as follows:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the FWRA, Roger W. Johnson, Administrator of the agency, issued an April, 19, 1994 memorandum announcing a buyout program (which became known as "Round I"). Under Round 1, employees were given until July 15, 1994, to sign a "non-revocable" Separation Agreement, and until December 31, 1994 (in certain cases, until March 30, 1995), to separate from the agency. Employees were informed that they would be held to their buyout commitments unless they showed "an extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances arising after" they signed the Separation Agreement and that an example of such extraordinary circumstances would be the unexpected death of a spouse. They were also advised to seek counseling and carefully review all available information in making the irrevocable decision to separate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 19, 1994, Administrator Johnson issued an E-mail message to agency employees informing them of OMB's projections that in two to three years the agency's workforce would be about half its current level and that be would review additional buyout opportunities. By a February 6, 1995 memorandum, Administrator Johnson announced a second buyout program ("Round II"). Under Round II, employees were given until March 17, 1995, to sign a Separation Agreement, and until December 31, 1996 (in certain cases, until March 31, 1997), to separate from the agency. As in Round 1, employees were informed that they would be held to their buyout commitments unless they showed "an extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances arising after" signing the Separation Agreement and that "few exceptions w[ould] be made." This statement was repeated elsewhere in the memorandum, as well as in an attachment, which further explained that "[a]n example of such extraordinary circumstances would be the unexpected death of a spouse."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 17, 1995, the appellant signed a Separation Agreement, electing to receive a buyout by taking early retirement from his GS-13 position of Systems Accountant. He chose December 31, 1996, as the date of his separation. On March 20, 1995, the agency approved his buyout election, and subsequently postponed his separation date to January 3, 1997, to coincide with the end of the pay period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By an August 27, 1996 memorandum, the appellant requested to withdraw his buyout commitment. He explained that he was unmarried at the time he agreed to retire but married in April 1996 and was planning to have children and that retiring would "adversely affect [him and his wife] both financially and personally." By an October 4, 1996 memorandum, Robert E. Suda, Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Director, Office of Finance, informed the appellant that his withdrawal request was forwarded to the personnel office but that it could not be approved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the appellant's subsequent inquiry regarding the status of his withdrawal request, Gail T. Lovelace, Director, Office of Human Resources, informed the appellant in a December 20, 1996 memorandum that withdrawals were not permitted absent "proof of an extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances arising after submission of [the] election" and that she could find no information which would support his withdrawal request. In a separate letter dated December 20, 1996, Lena E. Fant, Chief, Employee and Labor Relations Branch, stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Our budgeted ceiling levels for fiscal year 1997, the relatively light historical attrition levels and the need to sustain the workforce reductions achieved to date require that the agency adhere to the established program of buyout-induced separations. This program is viewed as the primary means of avoiding a profound level of administrative disruption within the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retired with a buyout on January 3, 1997. On appeal, he asserted that his retirement was involuntary because the agency improperly denied his request to withdraw his buyout commitment. After holding a hearing, the administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He found that the agency's denial of the appellant's withdrawal request was based on a valid reason--administrative disruption stemming from the agency's having set its agency-wide and office-wide staffing levels in reliance on the appellant's buyout commitment. The AJ then concluded that, because the appellant did not otherwise allege that his retirement was involuntary, his retirement was not subject to the Board's jurisdiction. Based on his jurisdictional determination, the AJ found that he was without authority to adjudicate the appellant's claim of age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee-initiated action, such as a retirement, is presumed to be voluntary and is therefore not within the Board's jurisdiction, unless an appellant shows that his retirement was obtained through duress or coercion, or shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Talley v. Department of the Army</span>, 50 MSPR 261, 263 (1991). The appellant has not asserted these issues here. He has asserted, however, that the agency improperly denied his request to withdraw his commitment to retire. If an employee requests to withdraw a commitment to retire, and the agency improperly denies the request, the employee's separation is deemed involuntary and tantamount to an <span id="Page_2003"></span>appealable removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of Defense,</span> 63 MSPR 270, 273 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b), an employee has a right to withdraw a retirement at any time before it is effective, unless the agency has a "valid reason" for refusing to permit the withdrawal<span class="Italic">. See Cook,</span> 63 MSPR at 273. Although section 715.202(b) refers only to a "resignation," it is equally applicable to a retirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Greene v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 48 MSPR 161, 165 (1991). A "valid reason" includes, but is not limited to, administrative disruption or the hiring or commitment to hire a replacement. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b). The Board has stated that speculation about the possibility of a future RIF is not a "valid reason," while evidence that the agency set its staffing levels based upon an employee's commitment to retire under a buyout program may be. <span class="Italic">See Wisdom v. Department of Defense,</span> 63 MSPR 333, 336 (1994); <span class="Italic">Browning v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 232, 239 (1994). The agency bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that it had such a valid reason. <span class="Italic">See Olsen v. Department of the Army</span>, 65 MSPR 60, 63 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Separation Agreement which the appellant signed is not a "valid reason" by itself to justify the agency's denial of his withdrawal request. <span class="Italic">See Cook,</span> 63 MSPR at 274 ("irrevocable" buyout agreement in itself is not a valid reason to deny a withdrawal request); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 12 MSPB 217, 14 MSPR 24, 35-36 (1982) (in general, federal employment is not governed by contract principles); <span class="Italic">but cf. Tretchick v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 F.3d 749, 751 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (the terms of a settlement agreement may constitute a "valid reason" under section 715.202(b)). Thus, the agency must establish a valid reason independent of the Separation Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the agency established a valid reason, based on administrative disruption, for denying the appellant's withdrawal request because the agency reduced its FTE levels based on buyout commitments. In support of this finding, the AJ discussed the record evidence including the following undisputed testimony of James A. Fellenbaum, the agency official responsible for administering the agency's FTE ceiling: In February of each year the agency receives its FTE level from OMB; in the fall of 1994, the agency had between 18,000 and 20,000 FTEs, and its goal was to reduce that to about 14,000 FTEs; in Round II, about 1,700 employees agreed to take the buyout, most with separation dates in fiscal year 1997; and the agency informed OMB of the number of buyout commitments, and each commitment was used to reduce the FTE level by one. Fellenbaum also testified that "FTE is accumulated over a year, so where you are at a given point in time is less important than whether or not the event you had planned on [here, the buyouts] really happen[ed]." He further testified that the agency was about 1,000 over its FTE target level as of December 1996, but that after December 1996, the agency was "back on target" in terms of its FTE ceiling because about 1,400 employees separated with a buyout effective December 31, 1996, as anticipated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant contends that granting his withdrawal request would not have caused administrative disruption because setting and meeting the agency's FTE ceiling was a fluid, flexible process, based on tentative projections which were subject to revision as circumstances changed. He further contends that, even assuming that the agency was above its FTE ceiling at the time he sought to withdraw his buyout commitment, the agency had over one year from that time to meet the FTE ceiling, so that any allegations of administrative disruption were premature and speculative. He also contends that the agency's FTE-reduction process had room to accommodate individuals withdrawing their buyout commitments and that the agency failed to show that granting his particular withdrawal request would have caused immediate administrative disruption such as the separation of other employees by a RIF or other involuntary means....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the FWRA, which obligated the agency to make substantial FTE reductions while avoiding RIFs or other involuntary means of separating employees, the agency implemented its buyout programs. Approximately 1,700 buyout commitments were made in Round II, and the agency's FTE ceiling was directly tied to those buyout commitments. To accommodate the large number of separations, the agency afforded its employees a lengthy period of time (up to two years) between signing the Separation Agreement and actually separating. This enabled both the agency and the employees to plan for their ultimate separations. This also gave the employees more time to change their minds about separating. The agency apparently recognized this potential problem and, as noted above, repeatedly informed its employees that they must carefully consider whether to separate with a buyout and that, once the commitment was voluntarily made, they would be held to it. At the same time, the agency apparently recognized that during this lengthy waiting period an employee's personal situation might undergo a drastic change that might warrant granting his withdrawal request based on reasons of compassion, unrelated to any administrative disruption, and acted reasonably by creating the policy that withdrawals would be allowed in rare cases for extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances. As the AJ pointed out, the policy enabled the agency to fairly and consistently process withdrawal requests and to ensure that only a few employees were allowed to withdraw their buyout commitments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we need not decide whether granting the appellant's particular withdrawal request would have had an immediate or direct adverse effect on the agency's FTE-reduction process, such as causing the agency to separate other employees by a RIF or to exceed its FTE ceiling for the pertinent fiscal year(s). As the AJ found, although there was enough flexibility in the agency's overall FTE-reduction plan to grant a few withdrawal requests based on extreme hardship, it was crucial to the success of the plan to hold most employees to their buyout commitments. To do so, the agency created the hardship policy and only considered withdrawal requests based on the policy. We therefore find that granting withdrawal requests, except under the hardship policy, would have been administratively disruptive to the agency's overall FTE-reduction process and that the agency thus had a valid reason for denying withdrawal requests, except under its hardship policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will enforce employee rights derived from an agency's own rules. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 273, 279 (1997) (an agency is required to act in accordance with the procedures it adopts for itself, and the Board will enforce employee rights derived from such rules, regulations, and collective bargaining agreements). The AJ did not resolve the issue of whether the appellant satisfied the agency's standard of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances. Because the record is complete on this issue, we need not remand it to the regional office and, instead, resolve it here. <span class="Italic">See Deskin v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 76 MSPR 505, 510 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In requesting to withdraw his retirement commitment, the appellant contended that he was unmarried in March 1995, when he signed the Separation Agreement, but married in April 1996 and was planning to have children. He further contended that his marriage "increase[d] the need for financial stability and security" and that his early retirement would cause "financial strain" and would "adversely affect [him and his wife] both financially and personally." The appellant's voluntary decision to marry does not approach the hardship example the agency gave of the unexpected death of a spouse, and we find that the agency did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the appellant failed to satisfy the standard of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances, Because the appellant did not satisfy the agency's standard for the hardship exception, the agency properly denied his withdrawal request. Accordingly, we conclude that the Board lacks jurisdiction over his retirement.</p>

GSA</span>, 81 MSPR 202, 207-08 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (1999), reversed the agency's decision to deny withdrawal of a VSIP retirement of an employee who suddenly found herself responsible for providing a family member medical care that required more income than her planned annuity provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will enforce employee rights derived from an agency's own rules. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Campbell v.

We therefore disagree with the agency's argument on review that the Board was without authority to examine whether the appellant satisfied the hardship or extraordinary circumstances standard.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In support of this argument, the agency contends that the scope of review applicable to an agency's penalty selection should be applied to the hardship issue and that the Board thus should not substitute its judgment for that of agency management. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981) (the Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness). Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the scope of review applicable to penalties is applicable to the hardship issue, the agency's argument that, the Board lacks the authority to review the hardship issue is without merit because even as to penalties the Board may substitute its judgment for that of agency management when the agency's judgment clearly exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR at 306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In requesting to withdraw her buyout commitment, the appellant contended that when she signed the Separation Agreement in February 1995, her mother was in good health, but that in August and September 1996, her mother's legs were amputated due to vascular disease. She stated that, as an only child, she had sole responsibility for her mother's care. She further stated that medical evidence was available to support her statements and explained that her retirement income would be insufficient to modify her home to accommodate her mother and to otherwise care for her mother's needs. She testified in support of these contentions during the hearing. The AJ found that the undisputed record evidence established that the amputations were unforeseeable at the <span id="Page_2004"></span>time the appellant signed the Separation Agreement and that she would be unable to adequately care for her mother with her retirement income. The AJ concluded that, under these extraordinary circumstances, retiring would cause a severe financial hardship for the appellant and that the hardship standard was thus satisfied. On review, the agency does not specifically dispute the AJ's findings, and we find no basis to disturb them. Accordingly, we CANCEL the appellant's retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Purzycki v. GSA</span>, 81 MSPR 188, 197-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-27 (1999), reversed as constructively adverse GSA's refusal to permit withdrawal of a VSIP retirement by an employee who developed diabetes and as a consequence of the complications of the disease would have difficulty securing income from a private consulting business:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, on March 16, 1995, the appellant signed the ESA, setting his resignation date as December 31, 1996. At the appellant's request, the agency, in July 1996, extended the appellant's separation date to January 3, 1997, and, in November 1996, again extended it, to March 31, 1997. On December 5, 1996, the appellant notified the agency that he no longer wished to resign and, on January 14, 1997, submitted a written request to withdraw his resignation allegedly based on a recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. On March 10, 1997, the agency denied the request, stating that its "budgeted ceiling levels for fiscal year 1997, the relatively light historical attrition levels and the need to sustain the workforce reductions achieved to date require[d] that the agency adhere to the established program of buyout-induced separations," which, it stated, was "viewed as the primary means of avoiding a profound level of administrative disruption within GSA."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his January 14, 1997 letter to the agency requesting withdrawal of his resignation under the buyout agreement, the appellant stated that he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus in July 1996 and feared that the disease would diminish his employment opportunities. He stated that he was attempting to manage the disease but that there was no assurance that complications would not develop. He explained that his decision to request a buyout was based on his intent to start a business, but, because of the uncertainty of his medical condition, starting a new business would involve more risk to his and his family's financial security than he had anticipated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant presented testimony, at the hearing, that he intended to start a consulting business which would have involved a considerable amount of traveling and expenditure of energy. He testified that, in early spring of 1996, he began to experience health problems that included an unusual amount of fatigue and thirst, as well as aches. He stated that, in early summer of 1996, he was diagnosed as a "type II diabetic." He testified that he received medical treatment, including medication and dietary changes and that, while some of his symptoms disappeared, he continued to experience fatigue, aches, and pains, and also began to experience numbness in his extremities and wounds that will not heal. He stated that he did not believe that he would have been able to cope with managing the disease and keeping up with the demanding schedule of a new consulting business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated that staying with the agency would have placed less strain on his medical condition because he had a long-term working relationship with the agency and would have had the benefit of the use of sick leave on the occasions when he was incapacitated. He testified that, even when managed, diabetes is a condition that can carry serious health complications. He testified that the agency did not request that he provide medical documentation for his condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the evidence presented, we find that the appellant satisfied the agency's standard of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances because of his unforeseen medical condition and that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency failed to establish that it had a valid reason for not permitting the appellant to withdraw his resignation before its effective date. <span class="Italic">See Ward-Ravenell v. General Services Administration</span>, 81 MSPR 202, 207-208 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) (the appellant satisfied the agency's standard of extreme hardship and extraordinary circumstances by establishing that amputation of her mother's legs was unforeseeable when she signed an ESA, that her mother's condition required her, an only child, to modify her home to accommodate her mother, that she would have the sole responsibility for her mother's care, and that her retirement income would be insufficient to meet these needs); <span class="Italic">cf. Perrine</span>, 81 MSPR at 164 &#x00B6; 19 (the appellant, who married approximately 13 months after he signed an ESA and who sought to withdraw his retirement commitment on the bases that he planned to have children and that early retirement would adversely affect him and his wife financially, failed to satisfy the standard of extreme hardship or extraordinary circumstances).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Green v. GSA</span>, 82 MSPR 45, 52-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16 (1999), involving consolidated PFRs, set aside the retirement of Appellant Hicklin, for whom unforeseeable circumstances in family support requirements necessitated continuing employment. The Board affirmed the retirement of Appellant Swerda, who remarried, purchased a new home, and whose spouse's income was likely to decline. Swerda's circumstances were not "entirely unforeseeable at the time he signed his separation agreement." Retirement was affirmed as to Appellant Green, whose spouse passed away, an event that did not cause a "major financial impact." The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Green v. GSA</span>, 220 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address whether 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b) applies to Petitioners' withdrawal requests. Although both the AJ and the Board applied this regulation, the agency argues that this regulation does not govern Petitioners' withdrawal requests. Specifically, the agency argues that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b) applies only when 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(a) applies, and that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(a) does not apply when a separation agreement is in place. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that, once an employee has entered into a voluntary separation agreement, he is no longer "free to resign at any time...[or free] to set the effective date of his resignation," as set forth in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(a). Instead, the agency argues, he is bound by the terms of the agreement. We see no difference, however, between the circumstances of an employee who is considering whether to enter into a voluntary separation agreement and an employee who is considering whether to resign voluntarily. Both employees are free to resign or not. Even if the voluntary separation agreement requires the employee to separate on a certain date, an employee who chooses to enter into the agreement is, in effect, choosing that date as his separation date. Moreover, Petitioners' separation agreements contained blanks, apparently completed by Petitioners, for "Desired Date of Separation." This indicates that Petitioners had some control over their separation dates. We also see no difference between the circumstances of an employee who has entered into a voluntary separation agreement and an employee who has tendered his resignation. Both have decided to leave their positions and have set effective dates for their departures. We therefore reject the agency's argument that Petitioners are not encompassed by section 715.202(a), and conclude that Petitioners' withdrawal requests are governed by section 715.202(b). This conclusion is consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Tretchick</span>. There, we applied 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b) where the employee had entered into a voluntary separation agreement as she was required to do under the terms of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Tretchick</span>, 109 F.3d at 751-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having decided that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b) applies to Petitioners' withdrawal requests, we must determine whether the agency had a valid reason for denying the requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners argue that the agency must demonstrate that the granting of their withdrawal requests would have led to administrative disruption. Petitioners assert that the agency cannot meet this burden because it would have been able to meet its workforce reduction goals even if it had permitted them to withdraw from their separation agreements and remain employed. The agency responds that its policy of granting withdrawal requests under only extraordinary circumstances gave it a valid reason for denying Petitioners' withdrawal requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Tretchick</span>, we stated that "[t]he employee's commitment to resign under the terms of a settlement agreement is a valid reason for an agency to refuse to accept her withdrawal." <span class="Italic">Tretchick</span>, 109 F.3d at 751. Although there are differences between a settlement agreement and Petitioners' voluntary separation agreements, <span class="Italic">see Perrine</span>, 81 MSPR at 166 &#x0026; n.* (Slavet, Vice Chair, concurring), we see no reason why the separation agreements at issue here should not provide a valid reason supporting the agency's denial of Petitioners' withdrawal requests. When the agency initiated its buyout programs, it notified its employees that a decision to enter into a separation agreement should not be made lightly. Indeed, it emphasized several times in several different publications relating to the programs that employees would be held to the agreements unless they met the agency's hardship requirement. Thus, unlike an employee who merely tenders his resignation, Petitioners entered into the separation agreements knowing that they would be held to them unless extraordinary circumstances arose before their separation dates. This limitation on the ability to withdraw from the agreements was, in effect, a term of the separation agreements. The agency therefore had a valid reason for denying Petitioners' withdrawal requests unless Petitioners satisfied the agency's hardship requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board interpreted 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b) as giving the agency discretion in deciding whether an employee has satisfied its hardship requirement and, therefore, in deciding whether to deny an employee's withdrawal request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Green II</span>, 82 MSPR at 53. In our view, the Board's determination that the regulation vests the agency with discretion as to whether to permit an employee to withdraw from a separation agreement is correct, because the regulation uses the word "may." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715-202(b) ("An agency <span class="Italic">may</span> permit an employee to withdraw his resignation.... An agency <span class="Italic">may</span> decline a request to withdraw a resignation...(emphasis added).); <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 205 F.3d 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("Words such as 'may'...show a[n]...intent to provide...broad discretion" <span id="Page_2005"></span>(internal quotations omitted).). The Board determined that the agency did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Petitioners did not satisfy the agency's hardship requirement. Having carefully considered the facts of the case, we see no reason to disturb that determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Green argues that he should have been permitted to withdraw from his separation agreement because his wife had passed away shortly before he submitted his withdrawal request. However, Mr. Green did not rely on his wife's death as the basis for his request. Even in his July 26 letter he emphasized his value to the agency as the reason he should be permitted to remain employed. Moreover, Mr. Green acknowledged that his wife's death did not have any significant impact on his financial situation. Under these circumstances, we see no error in the Board's decision that the agency did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Mr. Green had not satisfied the agency's hardship requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Swerda argues that he should have been permitted to withdraw from his separation agreement because of his changed financial circumstances. Mr. Swerda's circumstances, however, were largely of his own making. Mr. Swerda and his wife purchased their new house after he had entered into the separation agreement, when he should have known that his retirement would have an impact on his financial condition. Mr. Swerda's request letter admits that he could "make it" without his reemployment, but would likely have to get a new job or sell the house. Under these circumstances, we cannot fault the Board's decision to uphold the agency's determination that Mr. Swerda's financial situation did not rise to the level of "extraordinary circumstances" or "extreme hardship" that would have required the agency to grant his withdrawal request.</p>
