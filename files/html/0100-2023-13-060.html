<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-61"><span class="space">B.</span> REASONABLY FORESEEABLE ADVERSE EFFECTS; SPECULATIVE ADVERSE EFFECT</h3>
<p class="noindent">The degree of adverse effect triggering the duty to engage in arrangements bargaining defies ready definition. FLRA provided explanation in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ</span>, 24 FLRA 453, 458 (1986), involving a negotiable proposal concerning continuation of levels of training following a reorganization, distinguishing proposals that address impacts of management practices that can be said to be reasonably foreseeable and those proposals addressing speculative or hypothetical concerns:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal excessively interferes, the Authority indicated that as a threshold matter it would examine the record in each case to determine whether a proposal was in fact intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights. The Authority stated that it would look to "the effects or foreseeable effects on employees which flow from the exercise of those rights." [<span class="Italic">Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31 (1985)]. This threshold consideration excludes as appropriate arrangements proposals interfering with management's rights which address purely speculative or hypothetical concerns, or which are otherwise unrelated to management's exercise of its reserved rights. However, where an adverse effect on employees is reasonably foreseeable based on the record, the Authority will reach the question of whether the proposal excessively interferes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Chairman Calhoun dissented in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097</span>, stating what may have been his concern about a weakening of the "adverse effects" component of the appropriate arrangements test, 24 FLRA at 461:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the Authority to consider whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, a union must first demonstrate that employees have been or will be adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights and that the Union's proposal is intended to mitigate those adverse effects. <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>....&#8197;In cases filed before our decision in <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>, such as this one, we will examine the record to determine whether any adverse effects have been identified or whether such effects are identifiable based upon the nature of the matter in dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_587"></span>The Union in this case has not identified any adverse effects flowing from the reorganization....&#8197;Further, the Agency's statements cited by the majority do not show that the reorganization will adversely affect the amount of training opportunities available to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declined to issue broad guidance on the meaning of "adversely affected" under 5 USC 7106(b)(3), instead favoring adjudication on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">VA</span>, 71 FLRA 492 (2019).</p>
<p class="noindent">Additional definition of "adverse effects" in the context of the appropriate arrangements test was offered in <span class="Italic">West Point Elem. Sch. Teachers Ass'n and U.S. Military Academy West Point Elem. Sch.</span>, 34 FLRA 1008, 1010-14 (1990), involving a proposal, affecting teachers, that the employer agree to keep nonteaching duties to a minimum, consistent with sound educational practices. FLRA's discussion noted that "we will examine the relevant facts to measure the impact of management's imposition of, or changes in, job requirements of unit employees to determine whether the employees are adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to assign work includes the right to determine what duties and responsibilities are assigned to a position or employee....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 establishes a substantive criterion under which management must justify assigning nonteaching duties to teachers....&#8197;The provision directly interferes with management's ability to assign nonteaching duties to "a minimum, consistent with sound education practices."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the underlying concerns addressed by this provision may be laudable, because Provision 1 directly interferes with management's right to assign work, it does not constitute a negotiable procedure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the pendency of this case the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected determinations by the Authority that various proposals concerned with matters affecting the job requirements of teachers did not qualify as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3)....&#8197;<span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association, Inc. v. FLRA</span>, 876 F.2d 960 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">OED</span>). The Authority had held that management's establishment of job requirements, by itself, did not adversely affect employees....&#8197;The court held that...an "adverse effect" may flow from the exercise of any management right, and should not be restricted to situations where new job requirements are being applied to employees through "unfavorable job actions such as removals, demotions and reductions in pay."...&#8197;The court stated that the Authority erred because it "never measured the impact of management's changes upon the employees."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In this and in future cases, we will examine the relevant facts to measure the impact of management's imposition of, or changes in, job requirements of unit employees to determine whether the employees are adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work. Authority decisions which are inconsistent with this approach no longer will be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Agency claims that the Union's argument that employees are adversely affected depends on a "rather detailed, complicated set of events" and is, in fact, a "purely <span class="Italic">speculative</span> concern."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency points out that the adverse effects which, according to the Union, flow from management's exercise of its right to assign work are only indirect consequences of the exercise of that right. We find that the adverse effects depend on the occurrence of a chain of events and are not necessarily inevitable. Furthermore, nothing in the record indicates an existing or proposed Agency practice of assigning nonteaching duties to teachers to the extent that the teachers are adversely affected. Nevertheless, we find that the Union has more than merely a hypothetical or speculative concern. In circumstances where management may, entirely properly, assign nonteaching duties to an extent which detracts from an employee's ability to perform teaching duties, the adverse impact on employees which Provision 1 seeks to ease is reasonably foreseeable. Consequently, we conclude that Provision 1 constitutes an "arrangement" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). The question remains whether Provision 1 constitutes an "appropriate" arrangement or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's right. We answer this question by "weighing the competing practical needs of employees and managers." <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The objective of Provision 1 is to ameliorate the adverse affect...flowing from management's assigning [employees] nonteaching duties which detract from their ability to satisfactorily accomplish their teaching duties...on which they are evaluated....&#8197;However, because the potentially adverse effect may arise in limited circumstances and are far from inevitable, and in view of the absence of any evidence of an existing or proposed Agency practice in this regard, the benefit to employees is of relatively limited significance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The provision's limitation on management's right to assign work allows no exceptions which would enable management to respond to, for example, staffing or funding shortages....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that Provision 1 excessively interferes with management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">PASS and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 59 FLRA 25 (2003) (proposal was not negotiable arrangement when union failed to demonstrate that agency's procedural changes would actually result in loss of pay by holding employees responsible for decrease in overall safety statistics).</p>
<p class="noindent">The necessity for individual impact as a precondition to arrangements bargaining was noted in <span class="Italic">NAGE and VAMC, Brockton/W. Roxbury</span>, 37 FLRA 263, 272-73 (1990), involving the proposal that employees who were required to use a shuttle bus to move from one installation location to another be permitted to return to the originating installation during duty time; in other words, travel between the installations would be on duty rather than personal time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As written, section E leaves the Agency no option but to adjust work assignments in order to "ensure" that employees are able to return to their regular work site during their regular duty hours. Clearly, section E would afford a benefit to employees by neutralizing the impact of the assignment to a different work site on their personal lives. On the other hand, section E would have a significant impact on the Agency's discretion to make work assignments during an employees' regular work day. The Agency would have to forego the assignment of duties at its hospitals to an employee during the period that the employee was entitled to ride the shuttle pursuant to the proposal. Section E, as written, establishes a general obligation on the part of the Agency to return employees to their regular work site during their regular duty hours without allowing consideration of the hardship that this will create in particular instances on the Agency in accomplishing its obligations and without allowing consideration of the actual degree of hardship imposed on individual employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, establishing a blanket requirement that employees be allowed to return to their regular work site during their regular workday without providing for any consideration of the Agency's staffing needs versus an individual employee's hardship excessively interferes with the management right to assign work. In our view, on balance, the burdens imposed on the Agency's ability to conduct its operations in an effective, efficient manner outweigh the benefits to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA recapitulated its <span class="Italic">West Point</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 39 FLRA 153, 155 (1991), the case on remand from <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 876 F.2d 960 (D.C. Cir. 1989). FLRA continued its departure from a strict construction of the "reasonably foreseeable" test in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R12-105 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Adjutant Gen., California NG</span>, 37 FLRA 462, 466 (1990), involving the negotiability of a proposal that civilian technicians receive three hours of paid time per week to engage in physical fitness training to avoid losing National Guard positions that depended, in part, on their fitness to perform as guardsmen. Although FLRA decided that the burdens of the proposal outweighed its benefits, it considered the proposal under an arrangements test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The adverse effects described by the Union are not the direct, inevitable result of the Agency's exercise of its right to establish physical fitness requirements. That is, the mere establishment of physical fitness requirements does not automatically result in the removal of an employee from a position. However, it is reasonably foreseeable that some employees will be adversely affected by the physical fitness requirements....&#8197;In those circumstances where management determines that an employee no longer is physically qualified to perform the duties of the job to which the employee is assigned, that determination adversely affects the employee. "This exercise of management's right has an immediate and clearly defined adverse impact on the employee: the employee no longer will be able to hold that job."...&#8197;Therefore, we conclude that the proposal constitutes an arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit explained the distinction between reasonably foreseeable and speculative effects of the exercise of management rights as to a proposal requiring management to produce timely performance appraisals or be barred from later using the evaluations (and supporting information) against employees in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073-75 (D.C. Cir. 1992). [Discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-638.html#sec6-639">Performance Appraisal</a>."] The court accepted FLRA's reasoning that the statutory phrase "adversely affected" could extend to a preliminary step, appraisal, rather than to a later step, e.g., a proposed removal, that followed appraisal. The court expressed doubt that the relevant management right should be thought of as the hypothetical future personnel decision rather than the evaluation. In that same decision, the D.C. Circuit remanded, for reconsideration by FLRA, whether arrangements bargaining was appropriate as to a proposal that sought to bar management from detailing employees to higher-graded jobs for periods of time that were insufficient to warrant higher pay under another contract article. The assignment of the higher-level duties was not shown to have readily apparent adverse effects upon employees. That the short time of assignment might not justify a contract pay increase was, in the court's judgment, no more than a "bootstrap" argument to demonstrate adverse effects from the exercise of a protected management right. The court concluded its discussion with the observation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_588"></span>It seems rather obvious that the FLRA is seeking to stretch the adverse effects exception to the statutory reservation of management rights, but it simply cannot be that any benefit that the union seeks-and that implicates management rights-can be extracted from those rights simply by the linguistic trick of describing management's refusal to accept the union's demand as having created an adverse effect.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA adopted the D.C. Circuit's analysis in the remand decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 45 FLRA 1256, 1257-62 (1992), deciding that negotiations for benefits could not be dubbed arrangements bargaining. FLRA determined that denial of a negotiated benefit, standing alone, is not an adverse effect resulting from the exercise of a management right within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. The case was decided in the context of two proposals--that supervisors refrain from rotating or scheduling assignments of employees to avoid compensation of a particular employee at a higher level, and that leaves of absence be granted to employees elected to national union positions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Noting the Union's sole argument that this provision constituted an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority assumed, in <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> [39 FLRA 27 (1991)], that the provision directly interfered with management's right to assign employees and applied the test adopted in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>) to determine whether it constituted an appropriate arrangement. The Authority concluded, as relevant here, that the provision was an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign employees because the provision's objective was "to mitigate the adverse economic effect on employees when management curtails details to avoid paying increased compensation." <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 39 FLRA at 66. Applying <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, the Authority concluded that the provision did not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to assign employees and was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court rejected the Authority's reasoning. The court noted, in this connection, that there was no contention that "a temporary assignment to a higher-level position itself has an adverse effect on employees[,]" and that such assignment "would seem to provide employees with an opportunity to gain valuable new skills." <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d at 1073. In the court's view, the adverse effect addressed by the provision "evidently" was only the denial of a benefit: increased compensation for details involving higher-graded work which last one pay period or longer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court concluded that the provision did not appear to satisfy the requirement of section 7106(b)(3) that a proposed arrangement "address adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because, in the court's view, the Authority did not adequately explain how the provision constituted an arrangement, the court remanded the matter to the Authority for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute provides for negotiations over "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of" management rights. Consistent with the plain wording of the section and longstanding Authority precedent, a proposal cannot constitute an appropriate arrangement unless, among other things, it is intended to mitigate adverse effects resulting from the exercise of a management right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we conclude, in agreement with the court, that the provision would not address adverse effects resulting from the exercise of a management right. In this regard, the provision is expressly and solely directed at preventing management's curtailment of details to avoid the negotiated requirement for increased compensation. Even assuming that, as the Union argues, employees are adversely affected by short-term details in ways other than denial of higher pay, the provision does not address and would not mitigate those effects. Instead, it is clear that, as argued by the Union in earlier proceedings, the provision would enable the Agency to implement short-term details for reasons other than avoidance of the contractual requirement for higher pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the provision addresses only the denial of a negotiated benefit, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, that the provision does not constitute an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Therefore, as it is undisputed that the provision directly interferes with management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, it is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the future, the Authority will no longer find that denial of a negotiated benefit, standing alone, is an adverse effect resulting from the exercise of a management right within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. This is not to suggest, however, that, provided a provision addresses adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right, the provision cannot also address negotiated benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 39 FLRA at 44-50, the Authority concluded that, by requiring the Agency to grant leaves of absence to employees who wish to serve the Union in elected or appointed positions, this provision directly interfered with management's right to assign work. However, the Authority found that the provision constituted an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. The Authority concluded, in this regard, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]t is reasonably foreseeable that bargaining unit employees would be adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to deny leaves of absence if part-time union representatives are unavailable to assist employees in protecting their [rights under section 7102 of the Statute]. Moreover,...it is reasonably foreseeable that employees wishing to serve the Union would be adversely affected by management's exercise of the right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 47. Balancing the benefits afforded unit employees by the provision against the impact of the provision on the Agency's right to assign work, the Authority concluded that the provision did not excessively interfere with management's right and, therefore, was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, the court addressed the Authority's finding that the denial of leaves of absence would adversely affect unit employees. In the court's view, "[t]he employee's dilemma is caused by his or her election or appointment to the union." 690 F.2d at 1074. According to the court, the Union "proposed a benefit (leaves of absence for its officials), and the denial of that benefit purportedly produces the requisite adverse effects." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court rejected the Authority's conclusion that the effects of denials of leaves of absence on unit employees' rights to Union representation and rights to serve as Union representatives were sufficient adverse effects under section 7106(b)(3). Indeed, the court concluded that these rights were not "at all relevant[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. N.3. The court remanded the matter to the Authority because, in the court's view, the Authority had not adequately explained how this provision, "rather than merely seeking benefits for employees, compensate[d] for adverse effects that flow from the exercise of management prerogatives." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1075.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Longstanding Authority precedent confirms that management's right to assign work encompasses the right to grant, or deny, requests for leaves of absence....&#8197;Accordingly, although the Authority previously referred to adverse effects resulting from the exercise of management's "right to deny leaves of absence," 39 FLRA at 47, it is clear and undisputed that a denial of a leave of absence results directly from the exercise of the right to assign work and, as such, adverse effects flowing from a refusal to grant a leave of absence may be attributed to the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the sole adverse effects identified by the Union, in its original submissions to the Authority and in its supplemental submission following the court's remand, relate to the alleged denial of employees' rights to act as a Union representative and to receive Union representation. However, the court already has concluded that effects on these rights may not in this case be considered adverse effects sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....&#8197;Accordingly, as no other adverse effects have been alleged, and without addressing whether the Authority would conclude differently in another case, we conclude here that the provision does not constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As it is undisputed that the provision directly interferes with the Agency's right to assign work, it is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBPA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-115.html">60 FLRA 576</a>, 580 (2005) (arbitration award review: proposal concerning assignment of temporary duties sought by volunteers does not address adverse effect of exercise of management right).</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit reemphasized the need for arrangements bargaining to have a causal relation to the exercise of management rights. In <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOJ</span>, 994 F.2d 868, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1993), management notified the union that, because of a reorganization, there would be a relocation. The union sought impact bargaining and requested that some of the space being vacated by the agency be supplied to the union as office space. The agency declined to bargain over the proposal. FLRA concluded that the bargaining failure was a ULP. The court declined enforcement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that because the Authority ordered it to bargain over impact and implementation only, it has not violated the order the Authority entered against it unless its refusal is within the scope of the term "impact and implementation" bargaining. In support of this position, the Agency points out that the General Counsel's complaint in the original unfair labor practice proceeding did not charge it with refusing to bargain over the provision of an office to the Union where there had been no Union office before. The Agency asserts that its refusal therefore is not within that scope. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a matter of background law, impact and implementation bargaining arises as an exception to the management rights doctrine created by section 7106(a). That doctrine limits the general agency obligation to <span id="page_589"></span>bargain under the Statute by reserving to management officials the authority to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, make budget, organization, and work assignments. Section 7106(b), however, establishes that this section does not preclude an agency and a labor organization from negotiating "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising authority under" that section or "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of [such] authority." In other words, "although an agency is not required to bargain with respect to its management rights <span class="Italic">per se</span> it is required to negotiate about the 'impact and implementation' of those rights..." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, by case law and statutory reference, the term "impact and implementation" includes only the "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising" management rights and "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise" of such rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)(3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 50. It is not apparent that the disputed subject matter fits within either of those subsets.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It would seem clear that the creation of an office for the Union has nothing to do with the procedures used by management for the resource and personnel allocation involved in the decentralization of the unit.&#x2003;While the term "appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise" may be a bit more amorphous, it is not sufficiently so to engulf the present controversy. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992), we discussed the meaning and the scope of the phrase. We noted there that "in earlier decisions...involving section 7106(b)(3), we have reviewed union proposals to assist employees harmed by some management action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1162. We declined to extend the scope of the term to include proposals not designed for such purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further held that the teachings of <span class="Italic">Chevron USA Inc. v. NRDC</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), do not permit the Authority to extend the reach of that subsection. As is well known, and often quoted, <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> does require us to afford an agency, such as the Authority, great deference in its interpretation of an ambiguous statute entrusted to its administration. However, <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> teaches first that "if the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 842-43, 104 S. Ct. at 2781. Because we read section 7106(b)(3) "as unambiguously applying only where the FLRA has identified the reasonably foreseeable adverse effects that will flow from some management action, 969 F.2d at 1162, we did not afford <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to the agency to apply the subsection absent that condition, nor do we now.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior</span>, we denied enforcement of orders requiring agencies to bargain over certain details of drug abuse testing programs. Although no one challenged the Authority's argument that the proposal could succor "employees who suffered adverse effects," we held that such a proposal did not constitute an "appropriate arrangement" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) because it extended to all employees, not only to those adversely affected by the exercise of the management right. Here, there is no showing--nor does it appear that there can be one--that this new office proposal assists adversely affected employees, let alone that its assistance is limited to such employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, it appears that this case is closer to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1992). There we held that there was no appropriate arrangement for adversely affected employees where the proposal in question was one that would confer a benefit, and the only adverse effect was that flowing from management's denial of the proposal. In other words, we reaffirmed the underpinnings of the concept expressed in paragraph (b)(3) that to be within the exception, "the proposal must address adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1073. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury</span>, we vacated the Authority's conclusions that a benefit proposal came within the appropriate arrangement exception, stating that "the FLRA appears to have accepted a bootstrap argument, whereby the union proposes a benefit (higher pay for certain details lasting less than one pay period) and employees experience an adverse effect (lower pay) when management denies that benefit." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here the Authority has gone the <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury</span> case one better--or one worse--in that the proposal in question does not even describe a benefit for individually affected employees, the denial of which could be bootstrapped into an adverse consequence. Rather, it would confer a benefit on the Union as a whole, one more bootstrap away from precedentially established concepts of appropriate arrangements. We therefore conclude that the Authority's argument that the new office proposal is within its "impact and implementation" order is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reiterated that a proposal need not ameliorate the immediate and inevitable consequences of a management action; rather, a proposal need only address the reasonably foreseeable adverse effects that will flow from a management action and need not be limited to addressing harm that has already occurred. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1603 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Warfare Ctr., Patuxent River</span>, 47 FLRA 311, 316 (1993). But a proposal does not become a negotiable arrangement by seeking a benefit, unless an initial exercise of management discretion creates a need for that benefit to balance the adverse impact. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 3974 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI McKean</span>, 48 FLRA 225, 230-31 (1993) (concerning proposal for priority consideration of inside candidates for vacancies). Arrangements bargaining is not supported by an argument that unit members will suffer if they are denied a benefit sought by the union. The record must demonstrate that the proposal seeks to ameliorate the adverse effects that flow from the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2544 and DOJ, INS, Border Patrol</span>, 46 FLRA 930, 956 (1992). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 45 FLRA 339, 350, 359, 370, 379 (1992) (applying arrangements bargaining tests to proposals for official time), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute the Agency's statement that positions in Puerto Rico are generally filled by competitive procedures and, thus, that employees effectively volunteer for assignment there. Moreover, the record shows that the Agency's policy of a 3-year initial tour of duty in Puerto Rico was established at the inception of that post in 1987 and there is no assertion that this policy is not known to employees applying for competitive selection to a position there. Nor is there any indication that the Agency has misrepresented or concealed the conditions that exist in Puerto Rico. Thus, there is no basis for concluding that employees who volunteer for a 3-year assignment to Puerto Rico are adversely affected, as a general matter, by the Agency's action in choosing them for the position for which they have applied. <span class="Italic">See Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, 51 FLRA at 459 (proposal was not sufficiently tailored because, among other things, it would also apply to employees who voluntarily accepted reassignments for other than RIF-related reasons).</p>

See KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31.

See</span> <span class="Italic">KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the proposal in this case is an appropriate arrangement intended to ameliorate adverse effects such as harassment, intimidation, unauthorized release of home phone numbers, or unauthorized call back as a result of Iron Mountain employees' home phone numbers being maintained by telephone attendants located in Madison. However, the Union does not offer any evidence to demonstrate that these adverse effects are reasonably foreseeable. Moreover, the Agency claims that it has addressed the Union's concerns by adopting certain policies and procedures to safeguard the employee home phone numbers. In its Response, the Union does not address the Agency's safeguards and, consequently, does not argue that the measures are ineffective to eliminate its concerns. As the adverse effects asserted by the Union are speculative, particularly in light of the undisputed safeguard measures already taken by the Agency, we conclude that the Union has failed to demonstrate that the proposal ameliorates any adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right. As such, we find that the Union's proposal does not constitute an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">3529, </span>56 FLRA 1049, 1051-52 (2001) (dismissing petition for review where union's asserted benefits to bargaining unit members were speculative).</p>

The adverse effect, according to the Union, would be that military officers, who are not governed by the same USCG requirements as civilian employees, would place civilian employees' licenses "in jeopardy" as well as place them at risk for criminal charges for "mishaps." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> According to the Union, a "[f]ailure to negotiate this proposal would potentially adversely affect those employees' licenses and certifications and put them at significant risk to have criminal charges levied against them for any mishap." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We interpret this argument as a claim that the designation of a military officer to supervise civilian employees on the ship could subject civilian employees to some type of discipline and could otherwise adversely affect employees' conditions of employment. We conclude that the adverse effect that the Union seeks to mitigate is speculative. The Union has not provided any evidence that there is any reasonable likelihood that designating a military officer to supervise civilian employees would subject civilian employees to some type of discipline or otherwise adversely affect employees' conditions of employment. Similarly, there is no showing that military officers lack familiarity with USCG requirements, as the Union asserts, or, if they do, that there would be negative consequences for unit employees.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA's discussion of the appropriate arrangements/excessive interference test occasionally becomes somewhat abbreviated. Although a court upheld FLRA in one pronouncement, it cautioned FLRA against decisions so attenuated as to make meaningful judicial review impossible. <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1485, 1490-91 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (Proposal 8).</p>
