<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-158"><span class="space">6.</span> Waiver of Appeal Through Last Chance or Other Preappeal Agreement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">May the right to appeal be waived? Authors tend to answer their own questions. The answer is: Yes. Waivers of appeal rights may surface in settlement agreements--often in what are known as last chance settlement agreements (LCSA or LCA), sometimes known as abeyance agreements, that impose a penalty, suspend the imposition of the penalty during a period of good behavior, and waive an appeal if the penalty is imposed because the appellant violates the conditions set by the agreement. <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 624, 627 &#x00B6; 6 (1999), informs us that "[t]he Board has long recognized that an appellant's waiver of appeal rights in a LCSA is consistent with public policy." Initially, in <span class="Italic">Knight v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 601, 603 (1983), the Board specifically declined to decide if there are circumstances that permit an appellant to waive an appeal to the Board by agreeing to forego an appeal should adverse action later be taken on the occurrence of stated conditions, e.g., recurrence of unscheduled absences. In a subsequent appeal, an employee was removed for excessive absenteeism, but then reinstated on the condition that he serve a new probationary period and waive rights to appeal to the Board from any action during the one-year probation. <span class="Italic">Ferby v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 451 (1985) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-161.html#sec2-159">Jurisdictional Analysis</a>"), determined that an appeal right may be waived if the action is the informed, intentional relinquishment of a known right. Assuming the validity of the underlying waiver agreement, under <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> the Board upholds implementation of its terms if the agency demonstrates that the conduct charged against the employee violates the agreement and if the Board concludes that implementation of the agreement, particularly the waiver of appeal rights, is not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of agency discretion<span class="Italic">.</span> Under <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 1991), before the Board may rely on the waiver of an appeal right contained in an LCA, the Board must consider, upon appellant's challenge, whether the agreement was freely entered and whether the employee raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with the agreement or good faith compliance by the agency with the agreement. An appellant could challenge an LCA by showing it was signed as a result of fraud, undue duress, material deception, or other grounds invoked for setting aside settlements. [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-058.html#sec16-58">Unfiled Settlement Agreement; Preappeal Settlement</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-23-059.html#sec16-59">Collateral Attack on Settlement Through New Appeal</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-23-018.html#sec16-19">Settlement Arising from Disputed Last Chance Agreement</a>" for challenges to the validity of settlements, including last chance agreements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trotta v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 6, 11 (1997), summarized <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> and kindred decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's waiver of his statutory appeal right in a settlement agreement is enforceable and not against public policy if the terms of the waiver are comprehensive and freely made, and the execution of the waiver was not the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Fortson v. VA</span>, 309 Fed. Appx. 410, 411 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) ("An employee who waives his appeal rights as a condition of an LCA may appeal to the board if he makes a non-frivolous allegation that he did not enter into the agreement voluntarily or that he did not violate its provisions"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gomez v. VA</span>, 549 Fed. Appx. 990, 994 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) ("However, a decision to sign a last-chance agreement is not coerced just because an employee faces the unpleasant alternatives of signing the agreement or being removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (an employee's choice may be voluntary even when 'limited to two unattractive options'). The LCA itself states that the agreement was 'entered into freely and voluntarily...without coercion or duress.' Moreover, Mr. Gomez's union representative also signed the LCA.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although there is earlier law allowing removals resulting from LCAs reached in Board appeals to be challenged through enforcement proceedings, by 1997 the rule was and remains that the removal is challenged through a new appeal, <span class="Italic">Trotta v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 6, 9 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As a general rule, a petition for enforcement is the proper mechanism for obtaining relief where a party alleges breach of a settlement agreement by another party....&#8197;As a narrow exception to this rule, however, the Board has held that an appellant's request for enforcement of a last-chance settlement agreement should be docketed as a petition for appeal, rather than as a petition for enforcement where, as here, the appellant's challenge to the agency's compliance with the agreement involves a subsequent removal action taken pursuant to the terms of the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ciguzis v. Dept. of Labor,</span> CB-7121-15-0015-V-1 n.2 (NP 7/24/2015), defined an LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An LCA is a type of settlement agreement in which a disciplinary or adverse action is held in abeyance in exchange for a waiver of certain statutory rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Link v.

Should the employee not comply with the terms of the agreement, the previously proposed action is imposed, and the employee's right to challenge the action is limited by the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 453, 455-56.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1117"></span>LCAs may waive some or all potential appellate rights. Their effect upon Board appeal rights is summarized by <span class="Italic">Barber v. USPS,</span> CH-0752-10-0277-I-1 (NP 12/17/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of the Board's review is limited by the LCA; it is well-settled that the Board lacks jurisdiction over an action pursuant to an LCA in which the appellant waives his Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of the Interio</span>r, 113 M.S.P.R. 592, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">Lizzio v.

Further, an LCA can also provide for only a partial waiver of Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See generally Stratton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 2 (2001) (the appellant waived an EEOC appeal but not a Board appeal in the LCA); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of Defense</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 653, 656 (1996) ("[a] waiver may eliminate the employee's right to appeal any aspect of the underlying removal"). Furthermore, an LCA will be enforced according to its terms unless the appellant shows that (1) he complied with the agreement, (2) the agency breached the agreement or acted in bad faith, or (3) he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement, or the agreement resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Rhett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 13 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the LCA was reached outside of a Board appeal, as occurs when it is entered after a removal proposal or unappealed removal decision was issued, a removal under the agreement is challenged through a Board appeal, assuming the appellant has sufficient tenure to appeal under 5 USC 7511 or some other statute or regulation. When the appeal is filed, the AJ must inform the appellant of jurisdictional proof requirements. <span class="Italic">Stovall v. DOD</span>, CH-0432-11-0471-C-1 (NP 2/4/2015) ("The Board lacks jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to a LCA in which an appellant waives his right to appeal to the Board unless the appellant establishes that the appeal rights waiver should not be enforced. <span class="Italic">Easterling v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 12 (2008)."). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-09-087.html#sec2-86">Adverse Action or Performance-Based Appeal Arising From Last Chance or Other Settlement Agreement</a>" in this chapter.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The LCA, in its simplest mode, is a form of settlement with an employee who agrees that he has committed misconduct and who also agrees to reinstatement or continuation of employment on the condition of good conduct (as defined by the LCA) for a period of months, years or, perhaps, forever. The agreement imposes what amounts to a probationary period. If the employee misbehaves, the initial action is reinstated and the employee waives an appeal from that action. The basis of the dismissal of an appeal based on a valid LCA containing a waiver of the right to a Board appeal will be for lack of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Silva v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 268, 272 (1993). The absence of a waiver of appeal rights in a last chance agreement does not mean the agreement is void for lack of consideration from the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Elbert v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3312). [Refer to last chance agreements in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">LCAs come in many flavors. Some agreements waive an appeal to the Board from the penalty imposed by the agreement upon its breach. The agreement leaves the employee's compliance to the determination of the employing agency, subject to possible review by the Board for bad faith interpretation or application of the agreement. Agreements that waive appeal rights place the Board in the position of determining whether the condition stated for termination of employment was met. A hybrid agreement establishes a new probationary period; survival of probation restores the employee to fully tenured status. Or an LCA may involve a resignation triggered (and implemented by the agency) upon specified misconduct, coupled with an appeal waiver. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walters v. USDA</span>, 63 MSPR 348, 350 (1994) (agreement provided that appellant would voluntarily resign her position if agency determined she was guilty of further misconduct within a year; agreement provided for the waiver of appeal rights on breach).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An LCA that waives appeal rights in a removal action need not specifically reference service of a probationary period, and few agreements reference probation. The agreement is sufficient if the appellant agrees that his removal will be reinstated if he engages in any misconduct during the period covered by the agreement. The agency's dismissal of the appellant will not then be disturbed through the ordinary adverse appeal action process. The effect of the last chance agreement is to terminate the right of the ordinary adverse appeal. Assuming that the agency properly followed and invoked the LCA, the appellant's employment is ended without the right to appeal. Without the right to an appeal, the appellant has no right to a Board hearing, although the LCA would be unenforceable were the agency to act in bad faith or take other arbitrary and capricious action, <span class="Italic">Green v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 577, 581-84 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board addressed the validity of last-chance agreements in <span class="Italic">Ferby,</span> a consolidation of the appeals of two employees whose removals were reinstated pursuant to two similar settlement agreements. Under the terms of the agreements in <span class="Italic">Ferby,</span> the agency agreed to suspend the removal actions for one year provided the employees did not engage in any further misconduct. The employees agreed to waive their appeal rights to the Board during this one-year probationary period with regard to any disciplinary action. During the one-year period, the agency charged each employee with new instances of misconduct and reinstated the removal actions. The employees appealed to the Board, but the administrative judge granted the agency's motions to dismiss the appeals on the basis of the last-chance agreements. The Board sustained the dismissal, finding that the terms of the agreements were comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and that there was no evidence that the agreements were made in bad faith or were the result of duress on the part of the agency. Thus, the Board found that the employees had knowingly and intentionally waived their rights to appeal to the Board the reinstatement of the suspended removal penalties. Additionally, the Board noted that the employees were represented and that the agreements were fully negotiated by the parties and were the subject of mutual consideration. <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, 26 MSPR at 456.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petitions for review, the appellant argues that the chief administrative judge and the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Ferby.</span> The appellant argues that, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Ferby,</span> he did not agree to serve a new probationary period but agreed only that he would not engage in any further misconduct. The appellant contends that the omission of the term "probationary period" in his agreement with the agency means that the standard for removal of nonprobationary employees must be applied to his case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant portion the settlement agreement provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The undersigned agree that if, within a 1-year period from the date of his return to duty (February 23, 1987), Mr. Green's conduct, including adherence to leave rules, becomes unsatisfactory to management the removal action will be reinstated. Mr. Green understands that one incident of absence without leave or any other type of misconduct can be just cause for removal. The undersigned agree that if Mr. Green engages in any misconduct within this year, his removal will be reinstated and he waives any and all procedural rights to which he would otherwise be entitled under the provisions of 5 USC 7513, 5 CFR Part 752, Subpart C and the National Agreement between the SSA [the agency] and the American Federation of Government Employees, Articles 23, 24 and 25. The rights include but are not limited to the right to a proposal letter, the right to reply, the right to a 30-day advance notice and the right to grieve and appeal the removal action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the explicit terms of the agreement waiving the procedural rights generally afforded a nonprobationary employee, such as a right to advance notice and an opportunity to reply, we find no merit to the appellant's argument that he did not agree to waive these procedural rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the appellant's argument that he is entitled to a hearing on the merits. An appellant has a right to a hearing only in an appeal to the Board from any action that is appealable under any law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(l). Where, as here, the appellant has executed an enforceable settlement agreement in which he specifically waived his right to appeal the agency's actions, the right to a hearing also is waived. Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Butler</span> [<span class="Italic">v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 528 (1981)], a settlement agreement was not involved; rather, the Board was adjudicating a petition for appeal from a removal action based on charges of theft and possession of alcohol on agency property. Thus, we find no error in the administrative judges' citations of <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, nor do we find that the decision in Butler supports the appellant's argument that he should be afforded a hearing in both of his appeals. Further, in <span class="Italic">McCall v. United States Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court addressed the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal where the appellant's right to appeal to the Board had been waived in a last-chance agreement. The court stated that "[i]f an agency acts in bad faith or takes other arbitrary and capricious action, as a breaching party it would not be able to enforce the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 667. The appellant's allegations and evidence, however, do not raise a non-frivolous question as to whether "the agency acted in bad faith or acted arbitrarily or capriciously. Therefore, under <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction is not required. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> at 668-69.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee disciplined under an LCA (assuming the discipline, usually removal, is otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction), believes that the employee complied, and that agency did not comply, with the LCA, the employee tests compliance through a Board appeal from the resulting appealable action. On challenge to the agency's action invoking the LCA, the Board assesses whether the misconduct was embraced by the agreement, whether the misconduct occurred, and whether the misconduct was reasonably considered by the agency to violate the agreement. [Refer to Judge Plager's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Gibson v. VA</span>, 160 F.3d 722, 727-31 (Fed. Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">post,</span> for further explanation of the Board's role as a reviewer of an appellant's challenge to the agency's invocation of an LCA.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained the procedural ramifications of last chance agreements, <span class="Italic">Springs v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3196):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of a last chance settlement agreement, an employee may waive the right to appeal a removal action to the Board if the employee enters the agreement voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666 (Fed. Cir. <span id="Page_1118"></span>1988). In order for such an agreement to be enforceable, the employee must have had the capacity to enter the agreement, <span class="Italic">Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573, and the agency must not have acted in bad faith in procuring and enforcing the agreement, <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 667. Moreover, when an agency removes an employee for breaching a settlement agreement in which the right of appeal was waived, the employee can obtain review by making a nonfrivolous showing that the employee complied with the agreement. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1991). If the Board concludes that the agreement is enforceable and the employee breached the agreement, the consequence is that the Board is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the underlying removal action<span class="Italic">. Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 58 Fed. Appx. 469, 471 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) ("When an employee enters into a last chance agreement that waives the right to appeal in the event of a violation of the agreement, the employee can overcome the waiver only if he can show that he did not violate the agreement, that he did not voluntarily and knowingly enter into the agreement, or that the agency breached the agreement."); <span class="italic">cf</span>. <span class="italic">Searcy v.

Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">LCAs frequently result from settlement of Board adverse action or performance-based action appeals. [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-018.html#sec16-19">Settlement Arising from Disputed Last Chance Agreement</a>."] Upon challenges through appeals, the Board enforces LCAs against appellants if there is no <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> demonstration of fraud, coercion, mutual mistake, or bad faith in their administration. Appellants are held to the agreements reached by their representatives--wise or unwise--and it appears that an LCA negotiated by a representative will be applied against the appellant even if the appellant is not fully aware of its operative terms. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Montoya v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 314, 318-19 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 45 Fed. Appx. 928, 930 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP) (no legal requirement that the agency provide an employee with the employee's union representative of choice before the employee signs a settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency need not enforce all the terms of an LCA that allows it to reinitiate a removal. The agency may separately propose a removal and provide due process rights to the appellant even though, arguably, it could have relied upon an LCA to separate the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lockridge v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 613, 620 (1996) (no waiver of the right to appeal because the agreement did not include a specific waiver of the right to appeal a subsequent removal, the agreement referred to "probation" without defining the term, and the agency's removal proposal indicated that the agency did not interpret the agreement to provide a waiver of appeal rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When waiver of the right to appeal surfaces during an appeal, the AJ must ensure that the appellant is informed of the issue and of the type of required response, <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 145, 148 &#x00B6; 9 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's allegation of agency bad-faith noncompliance raised a question of Board jurisdiction, the administrative judge should have apprised the appellant of what he must submit to establish that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985). However, neither the administrative judge's acknowledgment order nor subsequent orders regarding jurisdiction advised the appellant of the showing he was required to make to establish Board jurisdiction. Specifically, in light of the waiver of appeal rights contained in the agreement, the appellant was required to show that the waiver should not act as a bar to the Board's adjudication of his appeal because the agency violated a material term of the agreement or acted in bad faith<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Link</span>, 51 F.3d at 1582. Thus, we must remand this appeal to afford the appellant the opportunity to establish Board jurisdiction based on the agency's alleged breach of the agreement's implied covenant of good faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Easterling v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 41, 47 &#x00B6; 13, 2008 MSPB 214 (2008), addressed the sufficiency of notice from an AJ to the appellant concerning the burden of proof relative to a challenge to a removal stemming from alleged violation of an LCA. In <span class="Italic">Easterling</span> the Board noted that one basis for the challenge is an assertion that the agreement resulted from fraud or mistake:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not raised by the appellant on review, the AJ did not provide <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice to the appellant of his burden to prove jurisdiction prior to issuing the ID, so we look to the agency's motion and the ID to determine whether the appellant ever received notice of his jurisdictional burden. <span class="Italic">See Scott,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 6. In its motion to dismiss, the agency cited<span class="Italic"> Buchanan v. Department of Energy,</span> 247 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2001), where the court held that to overcome a waiver of the right to appeal in a LCA, an employee must prove compliance with the LCA, that the agency breached the agreement, or that the employee did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement. Similarly, in the ID, the AJ also cited <span class="Italic">Buchanan</span> and notified the appellant that he could only prove Board jurisdiction if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation that "he did not violate the agreement, that the agency acted in bad faith, or that he did not voluntarily and freely enter into the agreement. Neither the AJ, nor the agency included the fourth criterion found in recent Board cases where the appellant could prove jurisdiction by alleging that the LCA resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 648, &#x00B6; 6 (2007); <span class="Italic">Willis,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6; 17. We find this omission to be error under <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> because neither the agency's, nor the AJ's, notice provided the appellant with explicit and complete information on what he needed to do to prove jurisdiction. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Burgess,</span> 758 F.2d at 643-44.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although much of the discussion addresses LCAs, the LCA is but one form of a settlement containing a waiver of appeal rights. Other settlements will also contain waivers of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Simmons v. SBA</span>, 115 MSPR 647, 653 &#x00B6; 11, 2011 MSPB 29 (2011), recapitulated the law on waivers of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's waiver of appeal rights in a settlement agreement is enforceable and not against public policy if the terms of the waiver are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and the execution of the waiver was not the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency. <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 6, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 318 Fed. Appx. 895 (Fed. Cir. 2008). A waiver of appeal rights that meets these criteria divests the Board of jurisdiction over an appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An appellant may establish that the Board has jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement wherein she agreed to waive her appeal rights if she can establish that the settlement agreement was invalid due to fraud, duress, coercion, or misrepresentation by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant seeks to establish that the March 10, 1998 settlement agreement, including its waiver provision, is invalid on account of fraud and misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal is settled, but without an LCA, and a new appeal is filed on the same claim underlying the original appeal, the second appeal would be barred through either <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or through application of the waiver contained in the settlement. <span class="Italic">Ford-Clifton v. VA</span>, 661 F.3d 655 (Fed. Cir. 2011). <span class="Italic">Cowart v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0140-I-1 (NP 2/3/2014), determined that a federal district court settlement waived a Board appeal right:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will consider a settlement agreement, even though it was reached outside of a Board proceeding, to determine its effect on the Board appeal and any waiver of Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Lee v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 4 &#x0026; n.2 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 367 F. App'x 137 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Such a waiver is valid if its terms are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and execution of the waiver did not result from agency duress or bad faith. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not disputed that the parties executed the settlement agreement in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The issues, therefore, are the following: (1) whether the appellant waived his Board appeal rights in the agreement and, if so, whether that waiver was voluntary; and (2) whether the parties intended that the Board retain authority over enforcing the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 24 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts and we agree that the settlement agreement encompassed the matters raised in the appellant's Board appeal and the appellant waived his Board appeal rights in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement did not explicitly refer to the Board appeal. Nonetheless, its explicit terms stated, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.&#x2003;[The appellant] and [his] heirs, executors, administrators, agents or assigns, and each and any of them, fully and forever release, acquit and discharge [the agency], and its past and present officials, employees, agents, and servants, from any and all claims, demands, rights, and causes of action of whatsoever kind and nature, known or unknown, which [the appellant] may have had, may now have, or may hereafter discover or acquire against [the agency] arising out of or in connection with any event, circumstance, or incident, occurring prior to, or as of, the date of this Stipulation, including, without limitation, <span class="Italic">all events and circumstances relating to [the appellant's]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> employment with [the agency]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">, any and all administrative claims and grievances</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's appeal of the agency's FAD was a claim related to his employment with the agency before the settlement agreement was executed. Therefore, we find that the plain meaning of the settlement agreement's terms included the appellant's Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 7. Further, by agreeing to "forever release" the agency "from any and all claims" arising from his employment before the execution of the November 2013 settlement agreement, the appellant waived his right to appeal his alleged involuntary disability retirement and the agency's alleged retaliation and discrimination based on the appellant's disability, which all allegedly occurred prior to June 2012. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the appellant's waiver of Board appeal rights was voluntary. The settlement agreement stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">17.&#x2003;The [appellant] represent[s] that [he has] reviewed and understand[s] this Stipulation, that [he is] fully authorized to enter into the terms and conditions of this Stipulation, and that [he is <span id="Page_1119"></span>entering] into the Stipulation freely and voluntarily and agree[s] to be bound thereby.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not disputed that the settlement agreement was freely made, was fair, and was not the result of agency duress or bad faith. <span class="Italic">See Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 9. Further, the agency provided consideration to the appellant in exchange for the appellant's waiver. <span class="Italic">See Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that the parties have not expressed an intention for the Board to retain authority to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement. Rather, paragraph 15 of the settlement agreement expressly indicates that the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California will retain jurisdiction over any claims arising from the settlement agreement, including, but not limited to, enforcement requests. Absent evidence to the contrary, the settlement agreement has not been entered into the record in these proceedings for enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24, 26.</p>
