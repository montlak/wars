<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-129"><span class="space">c.</span> Environmental Differential, Hazard Pay, Travel Pay</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under Adair v. United States</span>, 497 F.3d 1244, 1250-55 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over claims for environmental differential and hazard pay, but that entitlement, claimed by the plaintiffs as to environmental tobacco smoke (referred to as ETS in the court's decision), could not be based upon categories of hazards not identified in statute or in OPM regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Federal Claims for claims against the United States for money damages "founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort" and waives the government's sovereign immunity for these claims. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491; <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Mitchell II</span>). Thus, the Tucker Act does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages, but merely confers jurisdiction when such a right is conferred elsewhere. <span class="Italic">United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe</span>, 537 U.S. 465, 472 (2003). When the source of such alleged right is a statute, it can only support jurisdiction if it qualifies, as most statutes do not, as money-mandating. <span class="Italic">White Mountain</span>, 537 U.S. at 473.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mitchell II</span>, 463 U.S. at 217 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 400 (1976)), the Supreme Court held that a statute is money-mandating only if it "'can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.'" The <span class="Italic">Mitchell II</span> "fair interpretation" rule is satisfied when the statute is "reasonably amenable to the reading" that it is money-mandating. <span class="Italic">White Mountain</span>, 537 U.S. at 473. Thus, Tucker Act jurisdiction requires merely that the statute be "fairly interpreted" or "reasonably amendable" to the interpretation that it "mandates a right of recovery in damages," <span class="Italic">White Mountain</span>, 537 U.S. at 472-73, not that a plaintiff-appellant has stated a "proper claim" based on the statute or pled it properly. <span class="Italic">White Mountain Apache Tribe v. United States</span>, 249 F.3d 1364, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (internal citation omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd White Mountain</span>, 537 U.S. at 468. Indeed, the two inquiries are separate. <span class="Italic">See Greenlee County, Arizona v. United States</span>, 487 F.3d 871 (Fed. Cir. 2007) <span id="Page_5354"></span>(considering the jurisdictional inquiry to be separate from the failure to state a claim inquiry).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over Adair's complaint because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5545(d) and 5343(c)(4) are not money-mandating as applied to Adair. <span class="Italic">Adair</span>, 70 Fed. Cl. at 69. It viewed <span class="Italic">Fisher v. United States</span>, 402 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span> in relevant part and interpreting <span class="Italic">White Mountain</span>) (<span class="Italic">Fisher II</span>), as holding that the Tucker Act jurisdictional test is a "one-step process in which the source alleged as money-mandating would be evaluated against plaintiffs' claims to determine whether the source was money-mandating <span class="Italic">as to the facts alleged</span>." <span class="Italic">Adair</span>, 70 Fed. Cl. at 68 (emphasis added). This is not a correct reading of <span class="Italic">Fisher II</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fisher II</span> held that a single determination controls whether the plaintiff has identified a money-mandating source for purposes of Tucker Act jurisdiction and whether the statute on its merits provides a money-mandating remedy on which the plaintiff can base a cause of action but made clear that the question of whether the plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to make out a cause of action is a separate inquiry. <span class="Italic">Fisher II</span>, 402 F.3d at 1173 ("The single step would be one in which the trial court determines <span class="Italic">both</span> the question of whether the statute provides the predicate for its jurisdiction, and lays to rest for purposes of the case before it the question of whether the statute on its merits provides a money-mandating remedy.") (emphasis added). "[T]he determination that the source is <span class="Italic">money-mandating</span> shall be determinative both as to the question of the court's jurisdiction and thereafter as to the question of whether, on the merits, plaintiff has a money-mandating source on which to base his cause of action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Greenlee</span>, 487 F.3d at 876 (discussing the three different inquiries addressed in <span class="Italic">Fisher II</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a trial court concludes that the particular statute simply is not money-mandating, then the court shall dismiss the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Fisher II</span>, 402 F.3d at 1173. If, however, the court concludes that the facts as pled do not fit within the scope of a statute that is money-mandating, the court shall dismiss the claim on the merits under Rule 12(b)(6) for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1175-76 (non <span class="Italic">en banc</span> portion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Court of Federal Claims dismissed Adair's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, after holding that ETS did not fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5545(d) and 5343(c)(4) or their corresponding regulations. We disagree. The Court of Federal Claims correctly determined that the statutes in question are money-mandating. Even the government conceded there as here that the statutes are money-mandating, albeit not as applied to Adair so as to create an entitlement to damages. The Court of Federal Claims' determination that the statutes are money-mandating defeats the jurisdictional challenge and compels our conclusion that the trial court does have jurisdiction over the Adair cause of action as pled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the Court of Federal Claims based its dismissal on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, however, is not fatal to the judgment of dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Brodowy v. United States</span>, 482 F.3d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (declining to remand case to lower court to alter a judgment despite the fact that the court had dismissed the case for want of Tucker Act jurisdiction instead of for failure to state a claim because there were no practical differences between the two forms of dismissal under the facts of that case); <span class="Italic">Doe v. United States</span>, 463 F.3d 1314, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (dismissal of claim for want of jurisdiction instead of on the merits is harmless error); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. United States</span>, 70 F.3d 597, 604 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (treating a dismissal of a complaint for want of jurisdiction under the Tucker Act as a dismissal on the merits). Preceding its determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the Court of Federal Claims embarked upon statutory construction and an analysis of the implementing regulations. We address the correctness of the construction of the statute and regulations to determine whether it supports a dismissal of the Adair complaint under RCFC 12(b)(6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B. Interpretation of the two Statutes and their Implementing Regulations</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When we review a challenge to an agency's interpretation of a statute it has been charged with administering, this court engages in the familiar <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> two-step analysis. <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). Employing traditional tools of statutory construction, which include examining the language of the statute and legislative history, we first determine "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 842; <span class="Italic">see also Delverde, SRL v. United States</span>, 202 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000). If we conclude that Congress expressed a clear and unambiguous intent on the issue, "that intention is the law and must be given effect," <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9, and the only issue left for us to address is whether the agency's action or interpretation contravenes that intent, <span class="Italic">Delverde</span>, 202 F.3d at 1363. If, however, we determine that Congress was silent, ambiguous, or unclear on the precise question at issue, we advance to the second step of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> where we determine whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. 467 U.S. at 843. As long as the agency's construction is reasonable, we defer to that construction even if we do not believe it to be the best statutory interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Cable &#x0026; Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs.</span>, 545 U.S. 967, 980 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Adair alleges that their exposure to ETS falls within the scope of the two statutes and their respective implementing regulations. We analyze the language of the statutes and regulations to ascertain whether they have plain and ordinary meaning with respect to the coverage of ETS as a hardship or hazard. <span class="Italic">See Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.</span>, 534 U.S. 438, 450 (2002); <span class="Italic">see also Tesoro Haw. Corp. v. United States</span>, 405 F.3d 1339, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("We construe a regulation in the same manner as we construe a statute, by ascertaining its plain meaning.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government contends that we should accord <span class="Italic">Seminole Rock</span> deference to OPM's interpretation of its corresponding regulations, even though the interpretation is advanced for the first time during appeal, found solely in the government's brief (signed only by Justice Department attorneys), and not signed by any OPM official, much less one at the policy level, nor, as far as is revealed, circulated through OPM. <span class="Italic">See Bowles v. Seminole Rock</span>, 325 U.S. 410, 413-14 (1945); <span class="Italic">see also Gose v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 451 F.3d 831, 836 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In fact, only the listing of an OPM attorney as of counsel on the brief reflects any OPM involvement at all. We decline to do so, for there is "reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment" on the issue. <span class="Italic">Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 462 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also Long Island Care at Home, Ltd. v. Coke</span>, 127 S. Ct. 2339, 2349 (2007). Instead, we interpret the regulations without according deference to the government's litigating position. With respect to the issue of statutory construction, we apply the familiar <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> framework to the "precise question at issue," namely whether Adair qualifies for enhanced compensation because of their exposure to ETS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 5545(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office shall establish a schedule or schedules of pay differentials for <span class="Italic">duty</span> involving <span class="Italic">unusual physical hardship or hazard</span>, and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Under such regulations as the Office may prescribe, and for such minimum periods as it determines appropriate, an employee to whom chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title applies is entitled to be paid the appropriate differential for any period in which he is subjected to physical hardship or hazard <span class="Italic">not usually involved in carrying out the duties of his position</span>. However, the pay differential--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1) does not apply to an employee in a position the classification of which takes into account the degree of physical hardship or hazard involved in the performance of the duties thereof, except in such circumstances as the Office may by regulation prescribe; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2) may not exceed an amount equal to 25 percent of the rate of basic pay applicable to the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d) (emphases added). Clearly, the statute does not cover all physical hardships or hazards, but only those that are "unusual."[2] Adair alleges that the FCI Jesup employees worked in areas (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, enclosed areas) where inmates were permitted to smoke. This suggests that ETS was an expected condition of employment "usually involved in carrying out the duties" of Adair's position, especially when those duties involved the caretaking or monitoring of inmates. Additionally, ETS, as part of the ambient air, was commonly encountered indoors and outdoors where people worked or played in the 1960s when the statute was enacted. Thus, contrary to Adair's assertion, the plain language of &#x00A7; 5545(d) does not compel, or even support, a conclusion that ETS is "unusual" within the meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As the statute does not define "unusual," we apply its ordinary meaning. It is clear from a plain reading of the statute that "unusual physical hardship or hazard" include those "not usually involved in carrying out the duties" of an employee's position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does the legislative history support Adair's reading of the statute. The Classification Act of 1949 was amended on July 19, 1966, to add &#x00A7; 5545(d) authorizing hazardous duty payment in certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 89-512, 80 Stat. 318 (1966). Prior to enactment, separate hazardous duty pay was available for wage board employees, certain military personnel, and public health service employees but not for Classification Act employees, even those who labored beside these individuals, doing the same work. Therefore, the purpose of the amendment was to remove the inequality of Classification Act employees. <span class="Italic">See Hearing on H.R. 2079 and H.R. 5444 Before the H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service</span>, 87th Cong. 5 (2nd Sess. 1962) (testimony of Rep. George Wallhauser); <span class="Italic">Hazardous Duty Pay: House Report No. 31</span>, 89th Cong. (1st Sess. 1965). As John W. Macy, Jr., <span id="Page_5355"></span>Chairman of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We believe that unusual physical hardships or hazards which are inherent in a position, which regularly recurs, and which is performed for a substantial part of the working time, are best compensated for through the regular position classification process. However, there does not now exist a means for providing such compensation where regularly assigned duties are performed under unusually hazardous conditions at such irregular or intermittent intervals that these conditions cannot be taken into consideration for position classification purposes. Yet it seems logical that the Government offer some additional remuneration to the employee asked to take unusual risks not normally associated with his occupation and for which added compensation is not otherwise provided....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We would visualize assignments such as those requiring irregular or intermittent participation in hurricane weather flights, participation in test flights of aircraft during their developmental period or after modification, participation in trial runs of newly built submarines or in submerged voyages of an exploratory nature such as those under the Polar ice fields, and performance of work at extreme heights under adverse conditions, as among those meeting the criteria of unusual physical hardships or hazard. We recognize that in most regularly recurring hazardous work situations safety training and precautions have been developed which so greatly reduce the possibility of accident that the degree of hazard becomes negligible. The examples cited above, however, go beyond such conditions. They take into consideration, for example, such matters as the need to deliberately operate equipment such as newly developed or modified aircraft beyond its known design capabilities or safe operating limits, and exposure to elements or conditions over which little or no control can be exercised. Normally, few accidents occur in these hazardous situations; nevertheless, such assignments always are accompanied by the undeniable awareness of the inherent danger of the activity and the knowledge that an accident, should it occur, would almost certainly be fatal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hazardous Duty Pay: House Report No. 31</span>, 89th Cong. (1st Sess. 1965). Thus, Congress intended the statute to cover assignments that were inherently dangerous because they posed a risk of accident. An FCI employee's exposure to an inmate's cigarette smoke, unlike assignments at extreme heights, however, does not pose a risk of accident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress, moreover, could not have intended to have included ETS as an unusual risk or hazardous work situation because at the time the statute was enacted, Congress was unaware of the dangers of ETS. Yet Congress left open the possibility that ETS could be covered by the statute by delegating to OPM the authority to establish "pay differentials for <span class="Italic">duty</span> involving <span class="Italic">unusual physical hardship or hazard</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d) (emphases added). Arguably, OPM may have the authority to mandate payment for hazards that were not unusual at the time the statute was enacted. In any event, OPM has not done so, as discussed below. <span class="Italic">See infra</span>, Pt. II.B.2. Therefore, we do not decide any such issue today.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, too, Congress' amendment of the statute in 2003 to cover an employee's exposure to asbestos, which Adair contends is comparable to ETS. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, P.L. 108-136, &#x00A7; 1122 (2003). Even then, Congress did not mandate additional compensation for all levels of exposure to asbestos, only for those levels that were above the threshold set by the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA").[4] However, in the 2003 Amendment, Congress did not mandate additional compensation for ETS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The current threshold or permissible exposure limit is 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter of air as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.1001(c). We observe that even OSHA does not provide for coverage of ETS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Adair contends that exposure to ETS is unusual as a matter of law given society's <span class="Italic">current</span> attitude towards ETS. What is relevant, however, is not society's current attitude or even this court's attitude about ETS but Congress' view of ETS and OPM's actions regarding ETS. Although Congress knew about the dangers of ETS in 2003, it failed to add ETS as a separate compensable category under &#x00A7; 5545(d). Under the familiar canon of <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>, we conclude that Congress did not intend to include coverage of ETS, unless perhaps OPM later established a regulation providing for enhanced compensation. <span class="Italic">See Cook v. Principi</span>, 318 F.3d 1334, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). From reading the statute and legislative history, it is unclear whether Congress intended to cover ETS, especially since ETS was not a known hazard then. Possibly, OPM has the power to provide for enhanced compensation for ETS, but we need not decide this question because OPM never did so. Our analysis therefore progresses to step two of the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> framework (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, an analysis of OPM's regulations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Acevedo v. United States</span>, 824 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Tucker Act provided no jurisdiction over suit for danger pay under 5 USC 5928: "In a thorough and well-reasoned decision, the Claims Court concluded that the danger pay statute and the DSSR, taken individually or together, are merely money-authorizing and not money-mandating.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Tucker Act supported jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims for travel pay under the Federal Travel Regulations, although those regulations provided no relief for the plaintiff, <span class="Italic">Corrigan v. United States</span> (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP No. 2017-1471):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act gives the Claims Court jurisdiction over claims against the United States for money damages "founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort" and waives the government's sovereign immunity for such claims. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491. "[T]he Tucker Act does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages, but merely confers jurisdiction when such a right is conferred elsewhere." <span class="Italic">Adair v. United States</span>, 497 F.3d 1244, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe</span>, 537 U.S. 465, 472 (2003)). "When the source of such alleged right is a statute, it can only support jurisdiction if it qualifies, as most statutes do not, as money-mandating." <span class="Italic">Adair</span>, 497 F.3d at 1250.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, that a statute is money-mandating only if it "'can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained.'" 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 400 (1976)). In <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, the Supreme Court held that a money-mandating source of substantive law may be implicit, stating that a plaintiff need only show that "the source of substantive law he relies upon can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained." 463 U.S. at 216-17 (internal quotation marks, citation, and footnote omitted). The Supreme Court later clarified the "fairly be interpreted" standard from <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> in <span class="Italic">White Mountain</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This fair interpretation rule demands a showing demonstrably lower than the standard for the initial waiver of sovereign immunity.... It is enough, then, that a statute creating a Tucker Act right be reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages. While the premise to a Tucker Act claim will not be lightly inferred,...a fair inference will do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">537 U.S. at 472-73 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Adair</span>, we distinguished between when a claim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, when the substantive statute invoked is not money-mandating, and when it should be dismissed for failure to state a claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If a trial court concludes that the particular statute simply is not money-mandating, then the court shall dismiss the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1)....&#8197;If, however, the court concludes that the facts as pled do not fit within the scope of a statute that is money-mandating, the court shall dismiss the claim on the merits under Rule 12(b)(6) for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Adair</span>, 497 F.3d at 1251 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court determined that the FTR is money mandating and serves as a basis for jurisdiction in this case. We agree. In particular, one of the statutory sections cited in Corrigan's complaint, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702, states that federal employees are "entitled" to receive either a "per diem allowance" or "reimbursement" for "actual and necessary expenses of official travel" or a combination of the two, subject to regulations prescribed in the FTR. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702(a)(1). These statutory and regulatory provisions "can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government." <span class="Italic">Testan</span>, 424 U.S. at 400 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, Corrigan's claims founded on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702 form a basis for Tucker Act jurisdiction in the Claims Court. <span class="Italic">See McClary</span>, 775 F.2d at 283 (holding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5724, which mandates payment of certain travel and transportation moving expenses, is money-mandating).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court held that Corrigan's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because "the FTR does not require or authorize reimbursement of per diem costs for travel between an employee's official duty station and his residence, or for commuting time." Appellant's J.A. 15 (citing 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300-3.1 (authorizing reimbursement only for travel between an official duty station "or other authorized point of departure" and a "temporary duty location, between two temporary duty locations, or relocation at the direction of a Federal agency")). The Claims Court observed that Corrigan seeks reimbursement of expenses related to commuting between his residence in Belfair and his official duty station in Seattle, not expenses incurred for official travel. Appellant's J.A. 15-16. While Corrigan asserts that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the location of his official duty station, his complaint states that his official duty station is Seattle. We agree with the Claims Court that Corrigan seeks reimbursement for commuting expenses that may not be reimbursed under the statutes and regulations cited in his complaint. Because Corrigan's claims fail to state a plausible claim for relief, the Claims Court did not err in dismissing Corrigan's complaint.</p>
