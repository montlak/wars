<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-151"><span class="space">b.</span> Improperly Ordered</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">For civil servants outside the Postal Service, <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 62 MSPR 524, 527-29 (1994), made clear that an employee may not be disciplined for refusing to participate in an improperly ordered psychiatric fitness exam:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may order an employee to submit to a psychiatric examination or psychological assessment "<span class="Italic">only</span> <span class="Italic">when</span>." (i) A properly-ordered physical examination "indicates no physical explanation for behavior or actions which may affect the safe and efficient performance of the individual or others"; or (ii) a psychiatric examination "is specifically called for in a position having medical standards or subject to a[n established] medical evaluation program." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1) (emphasis supplied). An agency may offer a psychiatric examination to an employee who, for medical reasons, requests a change in duty status, assignment, or working conditions. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.302. In guidance to federal agencies issued shortly after the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued the regulations described above as part of a set of major revisions to 5 CFR Part 339, OPM interpreted its regulations as prohibiting disciplinary actions against employees who did not attend offered medical examinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual Bulletin No. 751-3 (Sept. 24, 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM developed these restrictions on agency use of psychiatric examinations in response to the concerns of a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, which had held hearings, pursuant to its oversight authority regarding the federal civil service, on the use of psychiatric fitness-for-duty examinations by federal agencies. The Subcommittee had found, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an involuntary psychiatric examination "places...the employee in a position of being a defendant who may lose his or her present and future prospects for employment as well as reputation in the community." Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">Forced Retirement/Psychiatric Fitness for Duty Exams</span> 18 (Comm. Print 1978). The Subcommittee had further found that "it is unlikely that a sufficiently certain psychiatric diagnosis of mental illness can be made on the basis of one or two interviews with an employee under great personal stress, in an adversary setting without commitment to therapy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Subcommittee had also noted in its report that a psychiatrist who testified had characterized an involuntary psychiatric examination as "an unfair and highly prejudicial encounter with an individual to whom [the employee] is supposed to 'tell all' about himself when in reality the information is going to be used against him." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8. The Subcommittee had recommended that statutory or regulatory reforms be adopted to eliminate the potential for agency abuse of psychiatric fitness for duty examinations and ensure procedural protections for employees who may be having performance problems due to mental conditions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the agency's order that the appellant submit to a psychiatric examination did not meet either criterion of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1). There is no allegation or evidence that the appellant's behavior or actions between the time that she returned to duty in 1992 and the time she was ordered to submit to a psychiatric examination in 1993 affected the safe and efficient performance of herself or others. Also, there is no allegation or evidence to indicate that the appellant held a position that had medical standards or that was subject to an established medical evaluation program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee must "obey an agency order, even if inappropriate," and protest the propriety of the order later, unless obeying the order <span id="Page_2621"></span>would place the employee "in a clearly dangerous situation." <span class="Italic">Nickerson v. US Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 451, 459 (1991) (citation omitted). There is no allegation or evidence that obeying the agency's order that the appellant submit to a psychiatric examination would have placed her in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, nevertheless, that the agency's charge of "failure to cooperate in an officially ordered medical examination" cannot be sustained. It is highly invasive of an employee's privacy to force him or her to undergo a psychiatric examination, the results of which will be reported to agency officials. Moreover, OPM placed highly specific restrictions on agency use of psychiatric examinations in response to the concerns of a Congressional committee with oversight responsibility regarding the civil service. The agency's order, which was issued in derogation of these restrictions, was more than "inappropriate," <span class="Italic">Nickerson;</span> it was the sort of order that the agency was not "entitled to have obeyed," <span class="Italic">Phillips v. General Services Administration</span>, 878 F.2d 370, 373 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (citations omitted).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal raises the issue of whether the agency had the authority to order the appellant to undergo an FFD examination with Dr. Hibler. In addressing this issue, we consider three possible sources of such authority: (1) Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations; (2) Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations; and (3) the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations governing an agency's authority to require a medical examination are set forth at 5 C.F.R. Part 339, Subpart C. These regulations, which became effective February 10, 1984, amended the then-existing regulations in 5 C.F.R. Parts 339, 432, 752, and 831. <span class="Italic">Collins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 256, 258 n.3 (1989). As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, "The revised regulations were intended to limit significantly the authority of agencies to order medical examinations for employees in light of previous abuses, particularly in cases involving psychiatric examinations and disability retirement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 258 (internal citations omitted). In its January 11, 1984 Federal Register Notice, OPM stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Part 339 regulations are explicitly intended to substantially constrain the number of situations where an agency may order an employee to undergo a medical examination. In most circumstances where the previous "fitness for duty" process would be initiated, the agency no longer has any authority to require an examination....Only under the very limited circumstances where medical standards or medical surveillance programs exist, or certain other limited situations, is the agency authorized to require an examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">49 Fed. Reg. 1321, 1324 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board explained in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 524, 528, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 39 F.3d 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), that OPM placed restrictions on agency use of psychiatric examinations in response to the concerns of a Congressional subcommittee with oversight responsibility for the civil service. The subcommittee had held hearings on the use of psychiatric FFD examinations by federal agencies and found that an involuntary psychiatric examination "places...the employee in a position of being a defendant who may lose his or her present and future prospects for employment as well as reputation in the community." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">Forced Retirement/Psychiatric Fitness for Duty Exams</span> 18 (Comm. Print 1978)). The subcommittee recommended the adoption of statutory or regulatory reforms to eliminate the potential for agency abuse of psychiatric FFD examinations and ensure procedural protections for employees who may be having performance difficulties due to mental conditions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)-(d), an agency may order a medical examination only in the following limited circumstances: (1) An individual has applied for or occupies a position which has medical standards or physical requirements or which is part of an established medical evaluation program, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b); (2) an employee has applied for or is receiving continuation of pay or compensation as a result of an on-the-job injury or disease, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(c); or (3) an employee is released from his or her competitive level in a reduction in force and the position to which the employee has reassignment rights has medical standards or specific physical requirements which are different from those required in the employee's current position, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(d). An agency may <span class="Italic">offer</span>, rather than order, a medical examination (including a psychiatric evaluation) in any situation where the agency needs additional medical documentation to make an informed management decision, including situations where an individual has a performance or conduct problem which may require agency action. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant's position did not have medical standards or physical requirements, and she was not in an established medical evaluation program. Moreover, neither of the circumstances set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(c) and (d) applies here. If agency officials believed that they needed additional medical documentation in order to make an informed decision about the appellant's conduct problem, the agency could have offered the appellant a psychiatric evaluation pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.302. The agency did not have the authority, however, to order her to undergo such an examination. <span class="Italic">See L'Bert v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 527-29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to the issue of whether the agency had the authority to order the appellant to take an FFD examination under the EEOC regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended. Under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c), an agency may require that an employee have a medical examination if it is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Further, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(f) provides: "It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this part that the alleged discriminatory action is specifically permitted by &#x00A7; 1630.14...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, if an individual alleges that an agency violated the ADA by ordering her to take a medical examination, the agency may claim as a defense that the examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity. Title 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c) only provides that an agency does not violate the ADA by requiring an appellant to undergo an FFD examination if the examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity. It does not give an agency independent authority to order an examination that is prohibited under the OPM regulations governing medical examinations.[8].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The ADAAA and its implementing regulations identify their purposes as the elimination of discrimination against, and to provide equal employment opportunities for, individuals with disabilities, respectively. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12101(b); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.1(a). Both the ADAAA and the regulations also provide that they do not invalidate any remedies, rights and procedures granted by any other federal, state or local law that provides greater protection. To the extent that OPM's regulations provide greater protection for employees regarding medical and psychiatric examinations, the regulations are consistent with the ADAAA and its implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding whether the agency had the authority under the applicable CBA to order the appellant to undergo an FFD examination, Article 18, Section 8, Item 4(B) of the CBA provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A fitness-for-duty examination may also be ordered before management takes disciplinary and/or adverse action against an employee for unacceptable conduct or behavior if it appears that a medical condition may be at the root of the problem.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This provision of the CBA is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. Part 339 insofar as it allows the agency to order an employee to undergo an FFD examination in situations where such an examination clearly would not be authorized under Part 339. In rejecting the agency's argument that the CBA provided it with the requisite authority to order the appellant to take an FFD examination, the administrative judge noted that, "under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1)[,] the parties to a negotiated agreement may not have been authorized to bargain for a term of the CBA that was inconsistent [with] part 339 because part 339 is a Government-wide regulation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 794 F.2d 1013, 1014-15 (5th Cir. 1986)). The administrative judge reasoned that, because the agency is covered by Part 339 and Part 339 is a government-wide regulation, the CBA does not provide the agency authority that would be lacking under Part 339.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute precludes collective bargaining with regard to matters that conflict with government-wide rules and regulations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see National Association of Government Employees Local R1-109 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Administration Medical Center Newington, Connecticut</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 500, 501 (1990). OPM's regulations set forth in 5 C.F.R. Part 339 are patently government-wide. Because the contractual provision relied upon by the agency as authority for ordering the FFD at issue here directly conflicts <span id="Page_2622"></span>with 5 C.F.R. Part 339, a government-wide regulation limiting the agency's authority to order employees to take medical examinations, the Board cannot enforce it in this proceeding.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The Board treats provisions of a collective bargaining agreement in the same manner as agency regulations. <span class="Italic">See Giesler v. Department of Transportation</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 277, 280 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Giesler v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 686 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1982). While this long-standing rule typically results in the enforcement of a contractual obligation assumed by the agency, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, where, as here, the collective bargaining provision conflicts with a government-wide regulation, the Board will not give it effect. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dodson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 504, 508 (2009) (declining to give effect to agency regulations under the National Security Personnel System that appeared to be in conflict with government-wide regulations and statute).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we affirm the initial decision insofar as it held that the agency did not have the authority to order the appellant to take an FFD examination and reversed the agency's action placing the appellant on enforced leave.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;We note that an agency has the authority and responsibility to maintain a safe workplace; an agency has several options when addressing troubling situations. An agency can immediately place an employee on administrative leave and order an employee to leave the workplace if necessary for workplace safety. An agency can initiate disciplinary action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 for acts of misconduct committed by the employee; neither the Rehabilitation Act nor the ADA immunizes disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (1999)). An agency can also utilize a shortened notice period for an adverse action if it reasonably believes a serious crime has been committed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1). Further, as we noted above an agency can <span class="Italic">offer</span> an employee a psychiatric examination pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.302 if it needs the information to make an informed management decision. In addition, both the Board and the Federal Circuit have long-recognized that an agency can indefinitely suspend an employee, pending inquiry, for psychological or other medical reasons if the agency has a sufficient objective basis for doing so. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); <span class="Italic">see also Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we discussed above, the agency did not have the authority to order the appellant to take a psychological examination.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not consider our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Doe v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579 (2012), in reviewing the agency's action. In <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, the Board considered the scope of an agency's authority to order an employee to take a fitness for duty examination. In deciding this issue, the Board considered the Office of Personnel Management's regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. Part 339, Subpart C, which govern an agency's authority to require a medical examination. These regulations, which became effective February 10, 1984, amended the then-existing regulations in 5 C.F.R.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)-(d), an agency may order a medical examination only in the following limited circumstances: (1) an individual has applied for or occupies a position which has medical standards or physical requirements or which is part of an established medical evaluation program, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b); (2) an employee has applied for or is receiving continuation of pay and compensation as a result of an on-the-job injury or disease, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(c); or (3) an employee is released from his or her competitive level in a reduction in force and the position to which the employee has assignment rights has medical standards or specific physical requirements which are different from those required in the employee's current position, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(d). <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 27. An agency may only order a psychiatric examination in the following two circumstances: (1) the results of a medical examination properly ordered by the agency under these regulations indicate no physical explanation for behavior or actions which may affect the safe and efficient performance of the individual or others, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1)(i); or (2) a psychiatric examination is specifically called for in a position having medical standards or subject to a medical evaluation program, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1)(ii). An agency may <span class="Italic">offer</span>, rather than order, a medical examination (including a psychiatric evaluation) in any situation where the agency needs additional medical documentation to make an informed management decision, including situations where an individual has a performance or conduct problem which may require agency action. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 27; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency stated in its proposal to remove the appellant that it ordered the fitness for duty examinations pursuant to its authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b) and (e). However, the agency has provided no evidence of the medical standards or physical requirements or the established medical evaluation program for the appellant's position of Social Worker as required under these sections to order a fitness for duty examination. Therefore, the agency has failed to prove that the position the appellant occupied at the time he was ordered to undergo a fitness for duty examination had medical standards or physical requirements or was part of an established medical evaluation program. If agency officials believed that they needed additional medical documentation to make an informed decision about the appellant's mental health and his ability to perform the duties of his position, the agency had the authority to offer the appellant a psychiatric evaluation pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.302. The agency did not have authority, however, to order the appellant to undergo such an examination. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 27. Because the agency lacked the authority to order the appellant to undergo a fitness for duty examination, the agency has failed to prove the appellant was unable to perform the clinical duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">L'Bert v. VA</span>, 88 MSPR 513, 517-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-13 (2001), found no support for an agency's directed psychological fitness exam of an employee who claimed a disability; the employee had the burden to supply supporting medical information, but the agency could not direct an examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that the agency ordered the appellant to report for a psychological fitness-for-duty examination; that it alleged that she actively avoided the examination; that it charged her with disrupting government operations, misrepresentation of fact, and deliberate refusal to carry out a proper order; and that the administrative judge sustained this charge. In her petition for review, the appellant argues that the agency had no authority to issue the order that led to these charges. The agency, however, argues that it had the authority and the responsibility to order the appellant to submit to a psychological examination. Specifically, it asserts that the appellant had claimed that she had a medical condition, asthma, that made her short of breath; that she had requested reassignment as an accommodation of this alleged disability; that she had failed to present medical evidence of her asthma; that a medical examination provided by the agency did not indicate that she had such a condition; that the appellant continued to request accommodation of her alleged disability; and that the agency therefore needed to have a psychological examination conducted so that it could respond to the appellant's request for accommodation. It also cites "Enforcement Guidance" issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as well as a regulatory provision proposed by that agency and a June 1999 Executive order, in support of its position that it had the authority to order the examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 62 MSPR 524, 52628 (1994), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 39 F.3d 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), the Board held that an agency could not discipline an employee for failing to cooperate in an examination it had ordered if, under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1), it lacked the authority to order the examination. Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1), an agency may order a "psychiatric examination" a term that includes a psychological assessment, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301(e)--only if:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;The result of a current general medical examination which the agency has the authority to order under this section indicates no physical explanation for behavior or actions which may affect the safe and efficient performance of the individual or others, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;A psychiatric examination is specifically called for in a position having medical standards or subject to a medical evaluation program established under this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not argue, and the record does not indicate, that the appellant's position had medical standards or was subject to a medical evaluation program established under 5 CFR Part 339. We find, therefore, that the agency had no authority to order a psychological examination under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we see no basis for finding that the order was authorized under <span id="Page_2623"></span>paragraph (i) above. Although the appellant complied with the agency's order that she submit to a medical examination by an agency physician on March 25, 1998, and although that physician reported that there was no physical explanation for the appellant's alleged difficulties, the agency has not shown that it had the authority to order that examination under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of that section--the paragraphs that govern an agency's authority to order medical examinations other than psychiatric or psychological examinations--provide that such an examination may be ordered only under the following circumstances: (1) When the position in question has medical standards or physical requirements, or is subject to a medical evaluation program, and when other circumstances are present; (2) when the employee has applied for or is receiving continuation of pay or compensation as a result of an on-the-job injury or disease; or (3) when the employee is released from her competitive level in a reduction in force and has assignment rights to a position that has medical standards or specific physical requirements that differ from those required in the employee's current position. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 339.301(a)-(d). None of these circumstances is present in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other authorities on which the agency relies also fail to provide a basis for the order in question. The Executive order to which the agency has referred, which provides generally for improved employment opportunities for persons with psychiatric disabilities, includes no mention of medical examinations; and the proposed regulatory section cited in the agency's response to the petition for review would provide only that the federal government is to be a model employer of individuals with disabilities, that it is not to discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities, and that agencies are to give full consideration to hiring, placing, and advancing such individuals. Exec. Order No. 13,124, 64 Fed. Reg. 31,103 (1999); 65 Fed. Reg. 11,019, 11,023 (2000) (proposing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, promulgation of new 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)). Moreover, neither the Executive order nor the proposed regulatory provision were in effect at times relevant to this case. In addition, while the parts of the EEOC Enforcement Guidance cited by the agency indicate that, when an employee or applicant requests accommodation of a disability, the employing agency may request documentation of the disability by a medical professional, nothing in them indicates that the documentation may be required or that the employee or applicant may be required to submit to an examination by an agency-designated physician. EEOC, Enforcement <span class="Italic">Guidance: Reasonable</span> Accommodation and <span class="Italic">Undue Hardship Under</span> <span class="Italic">the Americans With Disability Act,</span> Questions 6-8 (Mar. 1, 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that both the EEOC Enforcement Guidance on which the agency relies and the explanatory material OPM published when promulgating 5 CFR part 339 state clearly that the employee, and not the agency, bears the burden of showing a medical condition requiring accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Question 6 ("If an individual's disability or need for reasonable accommodation is not obvious, and s/he refuses to provide the reasonable documentation requested by the employer, then s/he is not entitled to reasonable accommodation."); 49 Fed. Reg. 1321, 1321 (1984) (burden of proving entitlement to accommodation is on employee, and, if employee fails to provide adequate evidence of medical condition requiring accommodation, agency is free to deny request for accommodation); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1324 (under regulations, employee bears burden of demonstrating that medical condition exists that the agency must take into account). The agency's argument that it needed the examination it ordered so that it could respond to the appellant's request for accommodation therefore is not persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the provisions of 5 CFR part 339 that are at issue here were promulgated in response to congressional concerns about the fairness and efficacy of ordering employees to submit to examinations such as this, as we noted in <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> and they were intended to limit the circumstances under which those examinations were conducted and thereby to eliminate the potential for abuse of such examinations. <span class="Italic">See Harris,</span> 62 MSPR at 528 (citing Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 95th Cong., 2d <span class="Italic">Sess., Forced Retirement/Psychiatric</span> <span class="Italic">Fitness for Duty Exams</span> 8, 18, 20 (Comm. Print 1978)); 49 Fed. Reg. at 1321, 1324. Allowing an agency to require psychological examination of an employee who requests accommodation of an alleged physical disability simply because the agency's own physician does not agree that the alleged disability exists would be inconsistent with this intent.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 119 MSPR 555, 2013 MSPB 45 (2013) (no basis for a directed psychiatric fitness exam; the appellant's own doctor unconditionally cleared him to return to work; no other basis for placing the appellant on an indefinite suspension);<span class="Italic">Traynor v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 386, 391-92 (1994) (noting that OPM regulations at 5 CFR part 339 (54 Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">If an agency violates its own regulations by removing an employee for failure to submit to a psychiatric examination that the agency has no power to order, the removal will be reversed; the agency in effect converted a voluntary preliminary evaluation procedure into a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination without the procedural protections required for the examination. <span class="Italic">Haisten v.

This is a variation on the usual theme that one obeys first and grieves later. Probably implicit in the Board's holding is the belief that psychiatric fitness examinations have been abused to harass employees into resignation, downgrading, or retirement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has the authority under Part 864.32 of its Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) to order fitness-for-duty examinations<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Nickerson v. US Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 451, 455 n.1 (1991). Moreover, under ELM Part 343.1, the agency may obtain a consultative specialist opinion from a local physician as part of a fitness-for-duty examination. We therefore find that the scheduled consultative examination with Dr. Silverman on December 17, 1992, was part of a fitness-for-duty examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is required to obey an agency order, even if inappropriate, and then grieve it later, except in circumstances where to obey the order would place him in a clearly dangerous situation<span class="Italic">. See Nickerson,</span> 49 MSPR at 459. The appellant has cited no record evidence, and we have found no evidence in the record, to indicate that he would have been put in a dangerous situation if he had reported for the December 17 psychiatric evaluation. We thus find at the threshold that the appellant was bound to obey the agency's order to report for the consultative examination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gannon,</span> a Postal Service case, involving authority under the ELM to require a fitness exam, is not likely useful guidance for the rest of the civil service because of OPM government-wide regulations restricting the use of fitness examinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. PBGC</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DOE_JOHN_DC_0752_09_0881_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_704976.pdf">117 MSPR 579</a>, 2012 MSPB 42 (2012), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a situation somewhat similar to the involuntary and illegally directed psychiatric fitness exam, the Board considered whether a charge could validly be brought against an individual who was directed to pursue psychotherapy at his own expense. The agency erred: "The agency has not established that appellant had a duty in law, rule, or regulation to obey such a directive or that his refusal to obey the warden's order constituted a specific act of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in relation to his assigned duties." <span class="Italic">Korowin v. DOJ</span>, 10 MSPR 17, 19 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an older, nonprecedential decision, the Federal Circuit placed less weight on the proprieties of fitness exams than what Board law now requires. Improper direction of a psychiatric fitness exam, when the results were used to support removal, did not warrant reversal of the dismissal without proof that the result could have been different had the agency fully complied with its regulations governing the exam. <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3153).</p>
