<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-170"><span class="space">l.</span> Hearing Entitlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A hearing may be required if there is a material issue concerning the scope or intent of a clause in a settlement agreement that waives a right to appeal, and a hearing may be required to resolve a contention that an employee complied with, or an agency seeking to enforce a waiver acted in bad faith or otherwise violated, a last chance settlement agreement to permit the appellant to avoid the waiver. A hearing could also be required to determine if the settlement agreement (or last chance agreement) encompassing the waiver was the product of duress or mental incapacity of the appellant. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-168.html#sec2-166">Bad Faith, Coercion, Lack of Mental Capacity</a>"; refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>," relating to duress and coercion in the formation of settlement agreements; refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-287.html#sec1-282">Summary Disposition of Claim</a>"; refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-062.html#sec3-62">Treatment of EEO and Other Affirmative Defenses; Summary Judgment</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-10-118.html#sec3-118">Dispositive Motions</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-10-121.html#sec3-121">Summary Judgment</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-10-007.html#sec3-8">No Material Disputed Facts</a>"; refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-006.html#sec12-7">Authority of Judge to Strike Frivolous EEO Allegation; Summary Judgment</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A hearing in cases involving LCAs depends on nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations, <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 668-69 (Fed. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCall's alternative position is that even if his waiver is not void as a matter of public policy, the board should be required to conduct a hearing on the jurisdictional question. To be determined at the hearing would be such matters as whether the waiver was comprehensive and fair, and whether it was the result of duress or bad faith negotiation. Inquiry would also be made into whether the terms of the prior settlement agreement were violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject this argument. There is no statute which requires the MSPB to hold a hearing on the question of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. MSPB</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Manning v. MSPB</span>, 742 F.2d 1313, 1427-28 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, the court held that it would be appropriate for the MSPB to hold a hearing where a petitioner's allegations raise non-frivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which cannot be resolved simply on submissions of documentary evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, McCall does not raise any non-frivolous issues of fact. The most he can say is that his union representative...opines that the intent of the parties was to allow McCall a large number of absences from work, provided these were approved and medically documented.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not think this raises any issue of fact. The settlement agreement which McCall signed speaks for itself. It is a contract, the interpretation of which is a question of law....&#8197;It was for the AJ to construe the settlement agreement, and [the union representative's] possible difference of opinion thereon would not raise any issue of fact.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boland v. VA</span>, CH-0752-11-0537-I-1 (NP 3/4/2014), described the nonfrivolous pleading standard required to obtain a hearing when the appellant challenges dismissal under an LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained by the administrative judge, the Board will not enforce waiver of appeal rights if the appellant shows that (1) he complied with the agreement; (2) the agency materially breached the agreement; (3) he entered into the agreement involuntarily or under duress; or (4) the agreement was the product of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Rhett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Gibson</span>, 160 F.3d at 725; <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In order to be entitled to a hearing, the appellant must first present a nonfrivolous allegation of material fact on one or more of these issues. <span class="Italic">See Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he did not breach the agreement and that the agency breached the agreement by acting in bad faith. If the appellant proved either of these general allegations, the Board would have jurisdiction over his appeal. However, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated, "[a]n allegation standing alone...is not sufficient. Although an appellant need not prove her entire case before she is entitled to a hearing, the board may request sufficient evidence to determine if, in the first instance, there is any support for what otherwise might be bald allegations." <span class="Italic">Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573. "Nonfrivolous" allegations are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue; <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations are insufficient to satisfy the nonfrivolous standard. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, &#x00B6; 6 &#x0026; n.2 (2013)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boland</span> denied a hearing as it applied the LCA to an email, sent by the appellant, that the agency characterized as misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant voluntarily entered into a last-chance agreement. The agreement concerned the agency's decision to remove the appellant, which was apparently based at least in part on what the appellant acknowledged to be an "inappropriate" email. The appellant has not contested the terms of the agreement as set forth in the documents filed by the agency. The agency agreed to hold the effective date of the removal in abeyance and to rescind the removal action after 1 year, "so long as [the appellant] continues to adhere to the terms and conditions of this agreement." The agency informed the appellant that, "[i]f there are any further infractions, major or minor, [within that 1-year period,] your removal shall be immediately effectuated." The last-chance agreement further provided that the appellant was required to adhere to his responsibilities in the agency's employee handbook, as well as "all VA policies, procedures, and processes." The appellant explicitly waived his rights to challenge the removal decision, including through an appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he did not breach the agreement because the agency did not have a policy against sending emails of the type for which he was terminated. He further alleges that, even if such a policy existed, it was not enforced at the time of his removal. The appellant states that the agency did not "routinely" discipline employees for similar emails, including the employee who forwarded to him the particular emails that led the agency to effectuate his removal. He relies on an affidavit from his bargaining unit president, who averred that "the receipt and dissemination by and among VA staff of emails similar in content and nature to those received and transmitted by [the appellant] is not uncommon[,] ...the imposition of discipline for the transmittal of such emails is sporadic and infrequent[,] ...the employee who forwarded one of the email messages to [the appellant] was not himself disciplined[,] ...[and][b]ased upon my experience, it is my opinion that it would have not been unusual or contrary to prevailing practice at the facility for [the appellant] not to have been disciplined for forwarding the emails in question."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's contentions, and, for the following reasons, we conclude that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that his emails did not constitute a material breach of his obligations under the last-chance agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this appeal is not what type of discipline might be appropriate for any agency employee sending these emails. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) ("[i]n a case like this, when determining whether an appellant has breached a [last-chance agreement], it is not the Board's responsibility to determine whether the breaching misconduct warrants removal."). The issue is whether the appellant violated his last-chance agreement by sending these emails. <span class="Italic">See Buchanan</span>, 247 F.3d at 1339 ("While ordinary employees might have enjoyed such latitude to depart from governing rules without disciplinary action, petitioner did not by the explicit terms of the last-chance agreement."). The broad language in the appellant's agreement requiring adherence to "<span class="Italic">all</span> VA policies, procedures, and processes," contained no exception for "minor" infractions. The appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that any term of the agreement required that he have committed misconduct that would independently warrant removal or any other particular level of discipline to constitute a material breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Tackett</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he is in compliance with his last-chance agreement because his emails do not violate any agency "policy." It cannot be credibly argued that the appellant's emails, are an appropriate use of government equipment, and the appellant was on notice that he needed to avoid even minor infractions during the period of his last-chance agreement. Notably, the removal action that was being held in abeyance was based on a prior "inappropriate" email from the appellant, and the affidavit of the bargaining unit president indicates that the agency imposed discipline for emails like the appellant's, albeit "sporadic[ly]and infrequent[ly]." Thus, we conclude that the appellant's bare allegations in this regard do not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of compliance, and the agency was not obligated to identify some more specific "policy" prohibiting sending such inappropriate emails using government equipment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, he has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was in compliance with his agreement because the agency does not "routinely" discipline employees for sending emails like the ones he sent. <span class="Italic">See Gibson</span>, 160 F.3d at 726-27 (finding that the last-chance agreement at issue applied by its terms to "<span class="Italic">any</span> violations of policy without any exceptions for 'minor non-recognized infractions[,] '" and that "[s]uch broad language does not require that the policy in question be routinely enforced to be effective"). The appellant has not made any allegation of disparate treatment as compared to any agency employee who was subject to a similar last-chance agreement. His arguments and the affidavit of his bargaining unit president concerning alleged dissimilar treatment of another employee for similar conduct are immaterial absent a nonfrivolous allegation that the comparison employee was subject to the terms of a similar last-chance agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he made a nonfrivolous allegation warranting a hearing regarding whether his breach of the agreement was "material." PFR File, Tab 1 at 8 n.2 (citing <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Department of Justice</span>, 334 F.3d 1065 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). We acknowledge the general principle that a breach must be material, i.e., it must relate to a matter of vital importance or go to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert</span>, 334 F.3d at 1071. The appellant, however, has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that his emails did not constitute a material breach. The terms of the appellant's last-chance agreement are dramatically different from the terms of the <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> agreement. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> IAF, Tab 5, Ex. 2, &#x00B6; 2 (broadly prohibiting the appellant from violating any agency policy, procedure, or process), <span class="Italic">with Gilbert</span> 334 F.3d at 1072-73 (explicitly designating particular activities that would breach the agreement related to the employee's treatment for alcoholism). Notably, the <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> agreement provided that the employee's removal would be triggered by any "<span class="Italic">serious</span> violation of DEA Standards of Conduct (defined to be any misconduct sustained by a Deciding Official for which a penalty of a 15-day suspension or more, to include demotions and removals[,] is imposed)." 334 F.3d at 1072 (emphasis added). In contrast, the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that his agreement contained a similar exception for "minor" infractions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation warranting a hearing on the issue of whether he materially breached the agreement. <span class="Italic">See generally Buchanan</span>, 247 F.3d at 1340 (a hearing was not required to <span id="Page_1148"></span>hold that the appellant's conduct was a violation of the terms of the last-chance agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 645, 649 (1989), added as to entitlement to a hearing concerning an LCA appeal waiver:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no statutory requirement that the Board hold a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 742 F.2d 1424, 1427 (Fed. Cir. 1984). <span class="Italic">See also McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 669. The statute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a), provides a right to a hearing on the merits, but only after jurisdiction has been properly invoked. <span class="Italic">See Manning</span>, 742 F.2d at 1427-28, citing <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 721 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1983). It is appropriate for the Board to hold a hearing where the appellant's allegations raise non-frivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which cannot be resolved simply on submissions of documentary evidence.[2] <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, 742 F.2d at 1428. <span class="Italic">See also McCall,</span> 664 F.2d at 669. In the present case, however, the appellant has not raised a non-frivolous claim of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge did not err by denying the appellant's request for a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] . To meet this burden, the appellant must proffer sufficient evidence to enable the administrative judge reasonably to conclude that the allegations are non-frivolous. <span class="Italic">See Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 761 F.2d 682, 685-86 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hanson v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1990 NP No. 90-3327), involving a preappeal settlement and waiver of appeal rights, also explained the necessity for nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations to obtain a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hanson...claims the right to a hearing on the question of jurisdiction based on his allegations that the Army acted in bad faith. While there is no statute requiring the Board to hold a hearing on the question of jurisdiction, a hearing would be held where a petitioner presented a non-frivolous claim that the agency acted in bad faith. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 600, 603-4 (1989). Hanson has presented no evidence to support his allegations of bad faith on the part of the Army. The record establishes that Hanson was impaired by alcohol on the dates alleged and that the AJ's determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To support jurisdiction (and entitlement to a hearing) when the agency implementation of an LCA is challenged, the appellant must do more than offer general allegations of noncompliance, <span class="Italic">Strothers v. USPS,</span> 167 Fed. Appx. 211, 214 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the allegation of bad faith, Strothers, both in his initial pleading and in response to the AJ's request for evidence, provided the AJ with nothing but bare assertions that the Agency changed the terms of the agreement. Strothers did not proffer specific facts or evidence that would demonstrate in what respects the copies of the agreement differed, or how the alleged difference prejudiced him. Because "'there is a presumption that public officers perform their duties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law and governing regulations,'" <span class="Italic">Haley v. Dep't the Treasury</span>, 977 F.2d 553, 558 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Parsons v. United States</span>, 670 F.2d 164, 166 (Ct. Cl. 1982)), and because Strothers has produced no evidence to suggest otherwise, we affirm the Board's determination that the allegation of bad faith was frivolous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's pleading burden is not particularly high to require the AJ to assess, as a component of Board jurisdiction, whether an agreement was violated. A nonfrivolous allegation of a violation, amounting to a nonfrivolous allegation that the appellant complied with or did not breach the agreement, is sufficient to require the AJ to adjudicate waiver of appeal rights from the action taken by the agency based on the alleged breach of the LCA. The Board explained the appellant's burden to provide a nonfrivolous allegation of a breach of the agreement, essentially couching it in terms of allegations and evidence, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/JOHNSON_MITCHELL_G_AT_0752_06_0968_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_262054.pdf">105 MSPR 648</a>, 650-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10, 2007 MSPB 134 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving that his appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] ; <span class="Italic">Hamiter v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 8 (2004). To establish that a waiver of appeal rights in a settlement agreement should not be enforced, an appellant must show one of the following: He complied with the agreement; the agency materially breached the agreement; he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement; or the agreement was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Zordel v. Department of Defense</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 13 (2005); <span class="Italic">Hamiter</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 8. Where an appellant raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with a settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of a waiver of appeal rights in the agreement. <span class="Italic">Zordel</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 13. Nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction are allegations of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (nonfrivolous claims are "claims that, if proven, establish the Board's jurisdiction").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement provides that the appellant will be demoted upon any "failure to adhere" to the terms of the agreement. The appellant argued before the administrative judge that the agency could not demote him under the terms of the settlement agreement because he had not breached it. The agency's determination that the appellant had breached the settlement agreement was based on the allegations of Ms. Hallman and a follow-up investigation. The agency's notice of proposed adverse action repeated Ms. Hallman's allegations that the appellant rubbed her back and told her that he "would love her forever if she carried an end [sic]." Ms. Hallman further alleged that she requested time off for a doctor's appointment and the appellant responded "that she didn't need to see a doctor, that she just needed to drink some Jack Daniels."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of proposed adverse action also noted as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Ms.&#x2003;Hallman allege[d]that she has been a victim of third party sexual harassment in that [the appellant has] engaged in inappropriate behavior with Rural Carrier Associate [Ms.] White. Ms. Hallman allege[d]that [the appellant has] made numerous comments and jokes of a sexual nature to Ms. White, that [the appellant has] hugged Ms. White and rubbed her back and that [he has brought] coffee to Ms. White on a daily basis. Further, Ms. Hallman allege[d]that Ms. White has received preferential treatment from [the appellant], such as being provided with assistance on a route on which she was previously denied assistance, being provided with a postal vehicle, and, being given Saturdays off.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency claimed that its investigation confirmed Ms. Hallman's allegations, as agency employees reported that the appellant engaged in the following activities: (1) brought coffee to Ms. White on a regular basis; (2) hugged Ms. White and other female employees and patted them on their backs; (3) made inappropriate and suggestive comments to Ms. White and other employees; (4) called Ms. White and other female employees honey and/or baby; and (5) "ogled" Ms. White. The agency also indicated in the notice of proposed adverse action that the "[e]mployees perceived that Ms. White received favoritism in work assignments, scheduling and in the way she [was]allowed to dress."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certainly, some of the foregoing activities might violate the settlement agreement's requirement that the appellant not engage in "inappropriate remarks of a sexual, offensive[,] or other improper nature and/or inappropriate physical contact with customers or postal employees." However, in responding to the agency's motion to dismiss and the show-cause order below, the appellant generally denied that he violated the settlement agreement. More specifically, he denied that "he committed the infractions cited in the notice of proposed action [and]disput[ed]the veracity of the allegations by [Ms. Hallman]." The appellant further asserted that numerous employees interviewed during the investigation stated that the allegations brought against him were misleading and untrue. Included with the appellant's response to the agency's motion to dismiss are alleged summaries of the interviews of the appellant and five other agency employees undertaken as part of the investigation. The accuracy of those summaries is unclear; however, they do uniformly state that those five other employees were unaware of any inappropriate conduct by the appellant. According to the summary of Ms. White's interview, she admits that the appellant has brought her coffee and that the two have hugged. The summary fails to describe the context of her interaction with the appellant, however, stating only that she did not believe that the appellant "has ever crossed the line with any actions or comments to her."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, at this stage of his appeal, is not required to prove the jurisdictional threshold issue of compliance with the settlement agreement, but need only nonfrivolously allege it. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Hamiter</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 12. The appellant's general denial of the agency's allegations, along with the interview summaries, constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that he did not violate the settlement agreement. Thus, he is entitled to a hearing to determine whether he, in fact, complied with the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148-49; <span class="Italic">Hamiter</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 305, 310 (1992) (there must be an assessment of whether the LCA was breached, and this determination may require a hearing to be convened by the AJ).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A nonfrivolous allegation supporting a hearing involving compliance or noncompliance with an LCA does not require supporting affidavits, but if the appellant's affidavit is supplied, it must be considered, <span class="Italic">Reed v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-13-0356-I-1 (NP 2/21/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we agree with the appellant that she is not necessarily required to submit any affidavit other than her own in order to make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. In finding to the contrary, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Leggate v. Department of the Interior</span>, 190 Fed. App'x 957 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The administrative judge recognized that this decision was nonprecedential, but he found its reasoning persuasive on this point. <span class="Italic">See Agbaniyaka v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 19 n.6 (2010) (the Board may rely on a nonprecedential Federal <span id="Page_1149"></span>Circuit decision to the extent that it finds the court's reasoning persuasive), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 484 F. App'x 545 (Fed. Cir. 2012). We do not find it persuasive. First, we note that the court seemed to have left open the possibility that "in some circumstances an employee's affidavit on its own could be sufficient to support a non-frivolous allegation." <span class="Italic">Leggate</span>, 190 F. App'x at 958. Second, the fact that a nonfrivolous allegation may be supported by third-party affidavits does not mean that it cannot be supported solely by an appellant's affidavit. <span class="Italic">Id.; see New England Power Generators Association, Inc. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 707 F.3d 364, 370 &#x0026; n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (explanation of denying the antecedent). Third, a "nonfrivolous allegation" is just that--an allegation. There is no requirement that it must be supported by an affidavit, much less multiple affidavits. <span class="Italic">Edem v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 501, 505 (1994). Fourth, requiring multiple affidavits from third parties to support a nonfrivolous allegation is contrary to longstanding precedent that the weight of the evidence does not figure into whether the allegation is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">See generally Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). For these reasons, we find that the appellant's failure to provide any supporting affidavits other than her own does not necessarily foreclose her from making a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with the administrative judge that the appellant's denials of her alleged misconduct (stumbling, slurred speech, dozing during group conversations, etc.), were insufficient to meet the nonfrivolous allegation standard. We acknowledge the basis for the administrative judge's finding, i.e., that the denials as stated in the affidavit were not unconditional but were couched in terms of the appellant "not recall[ing]" the alleged misconduct "[t]o the best of her knowledge, information, and belief," and we think that the administrative judge's findings in this regard were not totally unfounded. Nevertheless, read in conjunction with the unequivocal denial of this behavior as set forth in her jurisdictional response, we find that it is sufficient to meet the nonfrivolous allegation standard. We also disagree with the administrative judge that the affidavit fails to address the appellant's alleged unavailability to respond to the provider's return page. The appellant's affidavit read in conjunction with her submission as a whole addresses the matter sufficiently, albeit somewhat inartfully.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation sufficient to entitle her to a jurisdictional hearing, we are mindful that she is essentially being required to prove a negative, i.e., that she did not engage in the misconduct as alleged. Although the appellant's denials of misconduct could perhaps have been better crafted, we find that they are sufficient under the circumstances to show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact that warrants a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 648, &#x00B6; 10 (2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the LCA is unclear about what the appellant is supposed to avoid doing during the agreement's term, the AJ should not require more, than the appellant's straightforward and plausible denial that he did not engage in conduct that violated the agreement to establish jurisdiction and the right to a hearing in the appeal from the reinstated adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Malic v. VA</span>, No. 2007-3262 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the waiver of an appeal applies only to the validity of the original removal held in abeyance pending successful completion of an LCA, the Board must provide the appellant a hearing on the question of the validity of his removal following an alleged breach of the agreement if the appellant raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of whether there was a breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Pryor v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 590, 594 (1991) (agreement called for the avoidance of AWOL; at issue was the meaning of the phrase in the agreement: "established procedures" governing leave requests).

<p class="Body-Text">The Board analyzed the requisites to a hearing involving an LCA violation in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 344, 346-47 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erred, however, in failing to address the appellant's assertion that she did not breach the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court held that, although the waiver of appeal rights in "last chance" agreements is enforceable, the Board must address the threshold issue of breach before dismissing based on the agreement. Relying on <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court stated that where an employee raises an issue of compliance with a "last chance" agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of the appeal rights waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that a jurisdictional hearing is warranted. Generally, where an appellant makes a facially nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, he is entitled to a hearing....&#8197;Here, the appellant's assertion that she did not breach the agreement is nonfrivolous. She asserted that she had complied with the leave related provisions of the "last chance" agreement by providing her manager with medical excuses for her absences. The agency admits receipt of these excuses. The agency also admits that the appellant supplied a document regarding her financial status in an apparent effort to comply with the "last chance" agreement's provision that she provide evidence of continued financial counseling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the jurisdiction of the Board can only be determined by resolution of whether the appellant breached the agreement and, because the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that she did not breach the agreement, a hearing is appropriate before the administrative judge makes jurisdictional findings in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedure was restated, <span class="Italic">Freemont v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 57, 59 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991)...the Federal Circuit held that, where an employee raises a non-frivolous factual issue of compliance with a last-chance settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of the appeal rights waiver. Here, by holding a jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge properly afforded the appellant the opportunity to prove that he did not breach the settlement agreement and therefore that the Board had jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Trotta v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 6, 11 (1997) (restating <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>). To reach the point of determining whether the Board's jurisdiction is properly invoked and whether the appellant should receive a hearing, the Board's acknowledgment order must notify the appellant that he must make a nonfrivolous allegation of bad faith or coercion regarding the removal due to violation of a last chance agreement, and that the allegation must be supported by production of some factual evidence. <span class="Italic">Little v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 32 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are some limits on the right to a hearing. Although the Board must resolve compliance with an LCA when the employee raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance, a hearing is appropriate only if there are issues of fact concerning jurisdiction that cannot be resolved on submissions of documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">Ajaye El v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 351, 354 n.2 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Manning v. MSPB</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994), suggests that an AJ should not resolve a jurisdictional dispute without a hearing (assuming the hearing was requested) based on agency documentation that contradicts an appellant's nonfrivolous allegations of fact material to the jurisdictional issue. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-214.html#sec2-211">Jurisdictional Issues</a>" for decisions involving treatment of evidence by appellant and the agency on jurisdictional points.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It may be difficult to determine the scope of a waiver of appeal rights contained in a settlement. A hearing may be required to discern the drafters' intent. <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 145, 146-50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-5, 10-14 (2003), addressed the use of a hearing as to the scope or intent of the waiver provision in a preappeal settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency issued a notice of proposed removal of the appellant from his EAS-16 position as Supervisor, Customer Services, in Pensacola, Florida, on November 30, 1999. In a January 18, 2000 decision letter, the deciding official mitigated the proposed removal to a demotion to the PS-05 position of Part-Time Flexible Carrier in Gulf Breeze, The demotion became effective January 29, 2000<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to the effective date of the agency's demotion action and prior to any Board appeal, on January 31, 2000, the appellant and the agency entered into a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the settlement, the agency agreed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to hold the demotion action in abeyance pending the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) processing of the appellant's application for a disability retirement annuity. The agency also agreed to purge the demotion decision from the appellant's records if OPM granted the appellant's disability <span id="Page_1150"></span>retirement application. Further, the agency agreed that, if the appellant were unsuccessful in obtaining disability retirement after exhausting applicable appeals, the agency would reissue the demotion decision letter. In return, the appellant agreed to withdraw any pending appeals or grievance on the matter covered by the settlement agreement and not to institute or file any appeals, grievances, or complaints on the matters "noted herein."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, the appellant's union representative indicated in a letter to the agency that the appellant's "Application for Disability Retirement was disapproved because he was unable to prove his inability to continue service as a Postal Supervisor." On May 15, 2001, the agency reissued the decision letter demoting the appellant with an effective date of June 15, 2001.<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant filed a timely appeal of the demotion with the Board on June 18, 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After providing the parties an opportunity to address the jurisdictional issue, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without holding the hearing the appellant had requested. She found that the appellant had waived his right to appeal the demotion in the settlement agreement.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is well settled that a waiver of a statutory right must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive<span class="Italic">. Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 594, 597 (1998). Here, the language of the settlement agreement is too ambiguous to be considered a clear, unequivocal, and decisive waiver of the appellant's right to file an appeal upon the agency's reinstatement of a new adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On the current record, there is no way to determine the extent of the waiver the parties intended from the language and structure of paragraph 5 of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the waiver provision in this settlement agreement is unusual. It does not contain the type of language which the Board and its reviewing court, the Federal Circuit, have typically concluded is a knowing and valid waiver of appeal rights<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("[a]ppeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, Grievance-Arbitration and Equal Employment Opportunity complaint procedures are waived during this 1 year probationary period on any disciplinary action against Mr. McCall."); <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1993) (the appellant agreed in the settlement he would "knowingly and voluntarily waive [his rights] in any disciplinary actions taken by the [agency] for violating this agreement," including "appeal rights to the MSPB, EEOC, the courts, any negotiated or agency grievance procedures or any other forum"); <span class="Italic">Ferby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 451, 453 (1985) (the appellant agreed in the settlement agreement that "[a]ppeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, Grievance-Arbitration and Equal Employment Opportunity complaint procedures are waived during this one (1) year probationary period on any disciplinary action against [him] ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the language in the present agreement is analogous to that found in <span class="Italic">Coleman v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 270, 275 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, the settlement agreement merely provided for the withdrawal of the pending appeal and for waiver of the appellant's right to further appeal "the matters raised" or "arising from the actions involved in this appeal." Based on this language, the Board concluded that the appellant had not waived his appeal rights from any future agency action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At best, the waiver language is ambiguous and the administrative judge should have conducted a hearing at which the parties could have offered parol evidence concerning the proper interpretation of the settlement agreement<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Gullette v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 569, 573 (1996) (where a settlement agreement is susceptible of two differing reasonable interpretations, it is ambiguous and extrinsic (parol) evidence must be considered in order to construe it)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Birdsong v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 524, 528-29 (1997) (remanding to determine whether an agreement proscribing further alcohol-related misconduct applied to the appellant's off-duty arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol and his absence during the time he was incarcerated following the arrest). [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-205.html#sec16-203">Interpretation of Agreement: External Law; Extrinsic or Parol Evidence; Ambiguous Term; History of Performance; Hearing</a>."]</p>
