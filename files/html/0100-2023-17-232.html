<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-230"><span class="space">12.</span> Overtime Compensation</h4>
<p class="noindent">As a result of the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452, 1456 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Goldberg</span>, 498 U.S. 811 (1990), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Hove</span>, 22 F.3d 463, 465-66 (2d Cir. 1994), Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime claims for members of bargaining units were to be prosecuted under grievance procedures unless there was an express provision in the collective bargaining agreement excluding those claims from the grievance procedure and explicitly preserving those claims for enforcement in the courts. The grievance procedure assumed greater importance for the recovery of overtime pay under FLSA and the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA). Although an award enforcing a contract provision affecting overtime distribution may encroach on the management right to assign work, the award is not invalid if the contract provision limits but does not abrogate the right to assign overtime work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, St. Louis and NTEU Chapter 14</span>, 67 FLRA 101, 105 (2012) ("Authority precedent holds that 'provisions requiring management to exercise its management rights fairly and equitably...constitute [appropriate] arrangements' within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. BOP, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla., </span>65 FLRA 1040, 1044 (2011) (quoting <span class="Italic">SSA, Dallas Region, </span>65 FLRA 405, 409 (2010)). FLRA precedent also holds that arrangements pertaining to the equitable distribution of overtime do not abrogate management rights. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Austin, Tex., </span>65 FLRA 474, 476 (2011) (provision requiring agency to distribute overtime equitably does not abrogate management rights).").</p>
<p class="noindent">A statutory amendment in 1994 permitted FLSA cases to be brought in either court or through a the grievance procedure of a negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States</span>, 308 F.3d 1220, 1222-32 (Fed. Cir. 2002). FLSA overtime claims are still routinely pursued through grievance procedures. Although the FLSA authorizes overtime pay, overtime may also be paid under contract provisions negotiated with agencies with statutory pay-setting authority. <span class="Italic">See DODEA and Antilles Consol. Educ. Assn.</span>, 60 FLRA 80, 82 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLSA provides the federal minimum standards for wages and overtime. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 220 and SSA, Redding Dist. Office</span>, 65 FLRA 596, 597 n.2 (2011). Reduced to the essentials, overtime entitlement was reviewed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council</span>, 28 FLRA 574, 575 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Federal employee may be entitled to overtime compensation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 for "hours of work" in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek or 8 hours in a day. Overtime compensation for Federal employees is also authorized under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>., for nonexempt employees. Nonexempt employees may be entitled to overtime compensation under FLSA for "hours worked" in excess of 40 hours a week. When employees are entitled to overtime <span id="page_2105"></span>under both Title 5 and the FLSA, they are to be paid under the statute which gives them the greater benefit. <span class="Italic">Federal Prison System and American Federation of Government Employees Local 2459</span>, 8 FLRA 103 (1982); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Medical Center for Federal Prisoners and American Federation of Government Employees Local 1612</span>, 11 FLRA 29 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3614 and EEOC</span>, 60 FLRA 601, 603-05 (2005) (following remand, 61 FLRA 719 (2006)), explained distinguishing features of FLSA and Federal Employees Pay Act overtime compensation and compensatory time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Individual Employees' Claims to Overtime Pay</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of overtime pay, employees who are covered by the FLSA are classified as "non-exempt." Employees who are "exempt" from FLSA are covered by the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542. FEPA states that employees will be paid overtime "[f]or full-time, part-time and intermittent tours of duty, hours of work officially ordered approved in excess of 40 hours in an administrative workweek, or...in excess of 8 hours in a day...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a). Overtime work in excess of any included in a regularly scheduled administrative workweek may be ordered or approved only in writing by an officer or employee to whom this authority has been specifically delegated. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.111(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under OPM's regulations implementing the FLSA, an agency must compensate an employee for all hours of work in excess of forty in a workweek at a rate "equal to one and one-half times the employee's hourly regular rate of pay[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.501(a). "Hours of work" include time during which the employee is "suffered or permitted" to work. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.401(a)(2). Work is "suffered or permitted" when: (1) the work is performed by an employee for the benefit of the agency, (2) the employee's supervisor knows or has reason to believe that the work is being performed, and (3) the supervisor has an opportunity to prevent the work from being performed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.102(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A quarter of an hour is the largest fraction of an hour used for crediting irregular or occasional overtime work.<span class="Italic"> See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.112(a)(2), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.521(a) and (b). Irregular or occasional overtime work is overtime that is not scheduled in advance of an employee's work week. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.501(8)(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, although the Arbitrator stated that some employees worked uncompensated overtime ranging from "less than a few hours" to a claim of fifteen hours a week, she did not award overtime pay to any individual employees and stated that the Union has not shown that "the entire bargaining unit" has a claim to back pay. As set forth above, both exempt and non-exempt employees are entitled under the FLSA and the FEPA, as well as the parties' agreement, to overtime pay for uncompensated overtime, regardless of whether such overtime may be "less than a few hours."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the award is unclear, and we are unable to determine from the record, whether the employees who worked uncompensated overtime to which the Arbitrator refers are entitled to overtime pay under the applicable standards. The Arbitrator failed to distinguish between exempt and non-exempt employees, did not discuss the standards set forth by the FEPA and/or the FLSA, and did not discuss how much of the overtime work performed was irregular and occasional. In addition, it is unclear from the award what effect is to be given to the Arbitrator's statement that "the Union has not shown that the entire bargaining unit has a claim to back pay for overtime worked or that [s]upervisors knew or should have known that overtime work was being performed."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, this portion of the award is remanded to the parties for resubmission, absent settlement, to the Arbitrator for clarification. In particular, any subsequent award should address whether the individual employees are categorized as exempt or non-exempt, whether they worked uncompensated overtime entitling them to compensation under the applicable standards set forth by the FEPA or FLSA as discussed above, and, if so, the amount of compensation to which they are entitled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Non-exempt Employees' Option to Request Comp Time</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the regulations implementing the comp time provisions of the FLSA, "the head of an agency (or designee) may" grant comp time to non-exempt employees instead of payment under &#x00A7; 551.501 "[a]t the request of an employee." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.531. "Hours of work" under &#x00A7; 551.501 include time during which the employee is "suffered or permitted" to work. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.401(a)(2). An agency may not require that an employee be compensated for overtime work with an equivalent amount of comp time, and may not coerce employees or interfere with their "rights to request or not to request compensatory time off in lieu of payment for overtime hours." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.531(c).[5] However, an agency may permissibly mandate overtime pay, as &#x00A7; 551.531 provides only that an agency "may" grant comp time "instead of payment under &#x00A7; 551.501 for an equal amount of irregular or occasional overtime work" at the request of a non-exempt employee. Under &#x00A7; 551.501, if an employee is required, or "suffered and permitted" to work overtime, he or she is entitled to overtime pay, unless comp time is requested and granted pursuant to &#x00A7; 551.531.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;While not relevant in this case, we note that an employee may be given the choice to work overtime for comp time, or no overtime at all. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>,<span class="Italic"> Local 507</span>, 58 FLRA 378, 380 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that some non-exempt employees received comp time, rather than pay, for overtime work. The Arbitrator also found that "the Agency has not strictly or uniformly enforced the FLSA and Collective Bargaining Agreement which grants nonexempt employees the option to select either overtime pay or compensatory time off. It was clear that employees who testified were not granted the overtime pay option." As reflected in the regulations discussed above, the Arbitrator is incorrect in stating that the FLSA provides employees with the "option to select either overtime pay or compensatory time off." Instead, employees have a right to overtime pay and an option to receive comp time, if offered by the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that at least some non-exempt employees were given comp time, but it is unclear which of these employees, if any, were entitled to overtime pay under &#x00A7; 551.501. If such employees were entitled to overtime pay, but were required to take comp time in lieu of pay because they were unaware that comp time may be granted only at their request, the appropriate remedy is the payment of overtime pay, reduced by the value of the comp time already granted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command</span>, 57 FLRA 543, 548 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, this portion of the award is remanded to the parties, for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine, consistent with the foregoing, which, if any, employees were entitled to overtime pay and were erroneously granted comp time.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The FLSA governs compensation of Park Police officers for performing overtime work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1974, Congress extended the FLSA to federal employees but exempted employees employed in a "<span class="Italic">bona fide</span> executive, administrative, or professional capacity." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 213(a); <span class="Italic">Adams v. United States, </span>391 F.3d 1212, 1214 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The parties stipulated that Park Police officers are FLSA nonexempt, and, therefore, that the FLSA governs their compensation for overtime. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.104 ("FLSA nonexempt" defined as "covered by the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Act"); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.103(a) (any employee of an agency not specifically excluded from the FLSA by another statute is covered by the FLSA). Neither party points to any statute that excludes the officers from the FLSA. Accordingly, the Authority denies the exception to the Arbitrator's finding that the FLSA, along with &#x00A7; 5-1304, governs compensation for overtime work performed by the Park Police.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The FEPCA does not govern compensation of Park Police officers for performing overtime work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before 1974, the rights of most federal employees to receive overtime compensation was governed by the Federal Employees Pay Act, at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5541-5550a (FEPA). <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Air Force v. FLRA, </span>952 F.2d 446, 448 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1991). However, the definition of "employee" under the FEPA excludes some categories of employees including U.S. Park Police. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5541(2)(C)(iv)(II) (U.S. Park Police excluded from the definition of "employee" except for purposes of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5545(a) (night work) and 5546 (Sunday pay)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For federal employees covered by the FEPA who held positions that were not expressly exempted from the FLSA, agencies ensured compliance with both the FEPA and the FLSA by requiring that compensation be computed under both statutes and paying the non-exempt employees the greater amount. <span class="Italic">Doe v. U.S.</span>, 513 F.3d 1348, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In 1990, the FEPCA amended the FEPA, providing that federal employees who are covered by the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA are not subject to the overtime pay rates and computations established in FEPA. FEPCA, Pub. L. No. 101-509, &#x00A7; 529, title II, &#x00A7; 210, 104 Stat. 1427, 1460 (1990) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(c)); <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 529</span>, 57 FLRA 784, 785 (2002). The officers, being excluded from the FEPA, also are excluded from the FEPCA. Accordingly, the Authority finds that the FEPCA does not govern compensation for overtime work performed by the Park Police.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the interplay of credit hours, compensatory time, and FLSA entitlements, refer to <span class="Italic">Doe v. United States</span>, 513 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent">Overtime entitlement for General Schedule employees was reviewed in <span class="Italic">Radio Officers Union and NOAA</span>, 19 FLRA 632, 633-37 (1985), a negotiability decision helpful for its recitation of governing statutes and regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Union Proposal 1 would require the Agency to pay overtime to its General Schedule employees for all work performed on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. It also would establish that nonwatch-standing work between the hours of 1900 and 0700 would constitute overtime work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">General Schedule employees may be entitled to overtime compensation <span id="page_2106"></span>under either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542, as amended, or the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, as amended. If an employee is entitled to overtime compensation under both laws, he is entitled to receive compensation under whichever law provides him the greater benefit. 54 Comp. Gen. 371 (1974). Part 551 of 5 CFR governs pay administration, including overtime entitlement, under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Part 550, Subpart A, governs, among other things, overtime pay for employees covered under title 5 overtime pay provisions, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Union Proposal 1 is outside the duty to bargain. Under the proposal, those employees...would receive overtime compensation regardless of whether they had worked in excess of 8 hours a day or forty hours a week. However, under Statute and implementing regulation, overtime is authorized to be paid to employees who work in excess of 8 hours a day (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542) or forty hours a week (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 and 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(a)(1) as implemented by 5 CFR 551.501). For employees who work on Sundays, holidays and at night but not more than 8 hours a day or forty hours a week, other statutory provisions specifically provide for varying amounts of premium pay. For example, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5546 provides employees who work Sundays or holidays varying amounts of premium pay. Similarly, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5445 provides employees who perform regularly scheduled night work a specific amount of premium pay. Thus, the proposal would provide for overtime compensation in circumstances where employees have not met the legal requirements authorizing such payment, and, in fact, where in some circumstances the statutory provisions...authorize specific varying amounts of premium pay as opposed to overtime. Thus, the proposal here relates to matters which are specifically provided for by Federal statute...and therefore are expressly excluded from the definition of conditions of employment.... Further, the proposal is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 and 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207 and implementing regulations and is thus outside the duty to bargain under section 7117(a)(1)....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When a union has excepted to an arbitrator's failure to award backpay as contrary to the BPA and the Authority has determined that the arbitrator's findings support an award of backpay under the BPA, the Authority has concluded that "the employees who were affected by the...unwarranted action are <span class="Italic">entitled </span>to backpay." <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-45, </span>55 FLRA 695, 698-99 (1999) (Member Cabaniss dissenting as to another matter) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">cf. NAGE, Local R5-188</span>, 54 FLRA 1401, 1409-10 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting) (Authority determined, contrary to the arbitrator, that the grievant was "entitled" to an award of attorney fees). In other words, the Authority has found that where an arbitrator's findings support an award of backpay under the BPA, the arbitrator's failure to award backpay is contrary to the BPA. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R4-45, </span>55 FLRA at 698-99; <span class="Italic">cf. Ollett v. Dep't of the Air Force, </span>36 F. App'x 427, 428 2002 WL 1001063 at *2 (Fed. Cir.) (unpublished) (holding that, if an arbitrator finds that the disputed personnel action was unjustified or unwarranted and that the personnel action resulted in the employee's loss of pay, then the arbitrator "must award backpay in accordance with the provisions of [the BPA].").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that the Authority has stated that there is "nothing in the [BPA] that requires a monetary award for every unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 98, </span>60 FLRA 448, 450 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (<span class="Italic">Chapter 98</span>);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 916, </span>57 FLRA 715, 717 n.7 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Local 916</span>). But, as the Authority later clarified,<span class="Italic"> Chapter 98</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 916</span> involved situations where the arbitrators found that the requirements of the BPA were not met. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &#x0026; Intermediate Maint. Facility, Bremerton, Wash., </span>62 FLRA 4, 7-8 (2007) (<span class="Italic">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>). Therefore, as the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, reliance on <span class="Italic">Chapter 98</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 916</span> is misplaced in cases where the arbitrator finds a causal connection between the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and an employee's loss of pay. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also acknowledge the Agency's argument that backpay is not required because the Authority has upheld awards of the next available overtime opportunity on the basis of the "great latitude" of arbitrators in fashioning remedies. Opp'n at 7 (citing<span class="Italic"> USMC Logistics Base</span>; <span class="Italic">Robins AFB</span>). But the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">USMC Logistics Base </span>and<span class="Italic"> Robins AFB</span> is misplaced. In both<span class="Italic"> USMC Logistics Base </span>and <span class="Italic">Robins AFB</span>, the unions challenged the arbitrators' makeup overtime remedies as failing to draw their essence from the collective bargaining agreements at issue--not as contrary to the BPA. <span class="Italic">USMC Logistics Base, </span>39 FLRA at 578; <span class="Italic">Robins AFB, </span>25 FLRA at 970. Therefore, these decisions did not address the issue involved here: whether the BPA requires a backpay remedy when the requirements of the BPA are met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, when the Authority determines that an arbitrator's findings support an award of backpay under the BPA, then Authority precedent supports finding that the arbitrator was required to award backpay. Accordingly, we address whether the Arbitrator's findings support an award of backpay under the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support an award of backpay under the BPA, an arbitrator must find that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Atwater, Cal., </span>66 FLRA 737, 739 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first requirement, the Authority has repeatedly held that a violation of a governing agency regulation is an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">E.g., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA at 923. It is not disputed that the RNIAP is an Agency regulation that governs overtime assignments. Further, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the RNIAP, and there are no exceptions to that finding. Thus, as a matter of law, the first requirement of the BPA for an award of backpay is satisfied. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 64 FLRA at 923.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second requirement of the BPA, we conclude, based on the award as a whole, that this requirement is satisfied. In this regard, the award clearly states: "If the action of the Agency...is deemed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, then [backpay] is warranted." The Arbitrator's "[i]f...then" construction explicitly identifies a causal connection. As we have held that the Agency's violation of the RNIAP was an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, "then," in accordance with the findings of the Arbitrator, a loss of pay resulted, and backpay "is warranted."<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find misplaced the Agency's reliance on the Arbitrator's statement that the Agency's action did not "rise to the level of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action <span class="Italic">that resulted in a reduction of pay of the [g]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">rievant </span>as envisioned by the [BPA]." In particular, the Arbitrator's explanation of that wording supports a conclusion that he was referring to only the "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" requirement of the BPA, and not the requirement that the personnel action result in a loss of pay. In this regard, he explained that there was "some justification for the 'on-the-spot' decision" made by the chief officer, and he explained that he would have reached "a different result" if the Agency had been "engaging in a pattern of misassigning overtime." These explanations show that, in the wording cited by the Agency, the Arbitrator was assessing whether the chief officer's actions were an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, and not whether the grievant lost overtime pay as a result of the Agency's violation of the RNIAP. As noted above, we overturn the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency's actions did not rise to the level of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. Therefore, the language on which the Agency relies does not contradict our conclusion that the BPA's requirements are met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, the Arbitrator's findings support a conclusion that, as a matter of law, the requirements of the BPA were met. Thus, consistent with the above-cited Authority precedent, the grievant was entitled to backpay, and the Arbitrator's denial of a backpay remedy is contrary to the BPA. Accordingly, we modify the award to direct the Agency to make the grievant whole for the overtime pay he lost as the result of the Agency's violation of the RNIAP.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 231</span> was pursued into a circuit court by the agency, and FLRA requested a remand for further consideration of the case.

<p class="noindent-1">Relevant to the Agency's arguments about its policy, we note that arbitrators have the authority to interpret and apply agency rules and regulations in the resolution of grievances under the Statute, just as the Arbitrator did in this dispute.[26] But the Agency asserts that the Authority must defer to the Agency's own interpretation of the policy when evaluating its motion for reconsideration. Even assuming that such deference generally is warranted where an agency's interpretation of its <span id="page_2107"></span>regulation differs from an arbitrator's, the Authority does not defer to an agency's purely "litigative positions"; the Authority defers only to those interpretations that an agency "publicly articulated some time prior to" arbitration "over the disputed provision."[28] The Agency does not assert that it publicly articulated its interpretation of the policy provision at issue here prior to arbitration, so we decline to defer to that interpretation. Accordingly, we assess whether the Arbitrator erred in his interpretation and application of the policy.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When evaluating exceptions asserting that an arbitration award is contrary to a governing agency rule or regulation, the Authority determines whether the award is inconsistent with the plain wording of, or is otherwise impermissible under, the rule or regulation.[29] The pertinent provision of the Agency's policy states that the "remedy for a missed overtime opportunity <span class="Italic">due to administrative error</span> shall be provision of the next overtime opportunity to the affected employee." The Agency contends that this provision limits the remedies available in this case. But the Arbitrator did not find that the grievant lost his overtime opportunity due to administrative error. Rather, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's policy violation was "more than a mere mistake," and the Agency does not address this finding or attempt to show that it is inconsistent with the plain wording of, or otherwise impermissible under, the policy. In addition, the Arbitrator explicitly rejected the Agency's contention that the exclusive remedy for all policy violations is assignment of the next overtime opportunity.[32] In this regard, the provision quoted above does not state that its remedy is exclusive, or that it precludes a backpay award. As such, the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator's finding on the availability of a backpay remedy is inconsistent with the plain wording of, or is otherwise impermissible under, the policy. Therefore, the Agency has not demonstrated that <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span> exceeds the remedies that the policy authorizes.</p>

As we have rejected that argument, we also reject the Agency's remaining arguments and find it appropriate to deny the motion for reconsideration. However, we note that there is an additional basis for denying the motion. Specifically, the Agency's statutory arguments are inconsistent with the text, history, and purpose of Section (b)(4).[33] Congress amended the Act in 1998 to include Section (b)(4),[34] and the House of Representatives committee report regarding this amendment set forth that body's motivating concern and how the amendment addressed it:</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 44 FLRA 773, 792-99 (1992), comprehensively describes arbitrators' authority over FLSA claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the decision in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, Federal courts entertained Federal employee suits concerning FLSA matters without regard to coverage of those employees under a negotiated grievance procedure.... In <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, the court discussed the question of jurisdiction over FLSA claims and concluded that the negotiated grievance procedures mandated under section 7121 of the Statute are the appropriate mechanism for appealing FLSA matters unless those matters are specifically excluded by the parties. In that regard, the court stated: "Under the CSRA [Civil Service Reform Act], however, the rights of a unionized [F]ederal employee are consolidated within the four corners of the collective agreement: Congress defined a 'grievance' to include contractual disputes and 'any claimed violation...of any law.'" 909 F.2d at 1457 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)). The Claims Court follows the rule of <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> in deciding whether it has jurisdiction over FLSA claims by Federal employees. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Aamodt v. U.S.</span>, 22 Cl. Ct. 716 (1991); <span class="Italic">Beall v. U.S.</span>, 22 Cl. Ct. 59 (1990); <span class="Italic">Riggs v. U.S.</span>, 21 Cl. Ct. 664 (1990); <span class="Italic">Ackerman v. U.S.</span>, 21 Cl. Ct. at 487.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the role of arbitrators in deciding FLSA claims arising under negotiated grievance procedures, the court in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> rejected the plaintiffs' argument that arbitration is an inferior forum to court review and that arbitrators lack the necessary expertise to decide such issues. The court held that "it is manifest that Congress intended arbitrators to develop the expertise requisite to the construction and application of [F]ederal labor laws." 909 F.2d at 1457. The court also rejected the argument that arbitration is an incomplete remedy because there is no provision for attorney's fees or costs. The court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To be sure, Congress has extended the rights and remedies of the FLSA to [F]ederal employees. But the CSRA requires that [F]ederal employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement negotiate with their employing department or agency whether to preserve the FLSA remedy, or instead to commend FLSA claims to the bargained grievance procedures. By accepting a position covered by the collective bargaining agreement, appellants effectively chose the procedures negotiated by the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1458.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's jurisdiction to resolve the Union's grievance is not challenged in the present case and it is not necessary to discuss further the aspect of <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> that addresses the proper means by which Federal employees may pursue claims under the FLSA. However, it is relevant to our decision in this case to consider the court's statement concerning the authority of arbitrators chosen to resolve FLSA issues in grievance arbitration procedures. Following <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, it is clear that arbitrators have the authority to decide FLSA issues based on the application of pertinent law and regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Claims Court has similarly recognized the authority of arbitrators to apply pertinent law and regulations in deciding FLSA issues.&#x2003;For example, in <span class="Italic">Ackerman v. U.S.</span>, the Claims Court dismissed a suit by Federal employees who claimed that their agency improperly exempted them from FLSA coverage under OPM regulations. The court found that the matter was grievable under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. As discussed above, the court found that OPM's role as administrator of the FLSA in the Federal sector "does not divest management of its authority and responsibility" to determine which employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA<span class="Italic">. Ackerman v. U.S.</span>, 21 Cl. Ct. at 489. Noting that the employees were disputing the agency's application of law and regulations, the court emphasized that determinations as to whether the agency properly exempted employees from coverage under the FLSA "raise local, fact-specific issues that are best suited to the grievance procedures provided by the [collective bargaining agreement]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Riggs v. U.S.</span>, 21 Cl. Ct. at 669 n.5 (recognizing the right of appeal to the Authority of arbitration awards involving the interpretation, application or violation of law in FLSA matters).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the decision of the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> and the subsequent decisions of the Claims Court applying <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> are relevant to the issues before us. In <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, the court removed any doubt as to the ability of arbitrators to make decisions as to whether <span id="page_2108"></span>OPM's FLSA regulations were properly applied by an agency when the court stated: "Congress intended arbitrators to develop the expertise requisite to the construction and application of [F]ederal labor laws." 909 F.2d at 1457. Further, it is clear from the decisions of the Claims Court that it is an agency's duty to make determinations on the "fact-specific issues" of whether employees are exempt from FLSA coverage under applicable OPM regulations. <span class="Italic">Ackerman v. U.S.</span>, 21 Cl. Ct. at 489.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator's award is deficient on the basis that the Arbitrator "virtually ignore[d]" OPM's regulations regarding the exemption of administrative employees from FLSA coverage and failed to give proper deference to OPM's interpretation of those regulations.... To the contrary, it is clear that the Arbitrator specifically applied the OPM regulations in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.205(a) and the guidelines for application of the regulations contained in FPM Letter 551-7. Applying those regulations and guidelines, he concluded that the grievants were not properly exempted from FLSA coverage under the OPM regulations. The Arbitrator did not modify or invalidate the regulations but, rather, applied them by comparing the definition of administrative employee established by OPM in its regulations to the actual work performed by the grievant in their positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Agency's arguments concerning the regulations of OPM, the Arbitrator quoted and applied the exemption criteria of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.205. He also quoted and considered the relevant provisions of FPM Letter 551-7 describing the primary duty tests for determining when employees are administrative employees under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 22-24. The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's arguments that the grievants were properly exempted from FLSA coverage under OPM regulations. Instead, he found that OPM's expert witness did not establish that the grievants make "significant determinations in furtherance of the operation of programs and accomplishment of program objectives" and, consequently, failed to show that the grievants "significantly affect the execution of management policies or programs (the first OPM test of primary duty)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 22 (emphasis deleted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that the grievants were not properly classified as exempt from FLSA coverage under the general requirements of FPM Letter 551-7. He noted that: (1) the FPM letter specifically requires that "FLSA exemptions must be narrowly construed and applied only to employees who are clearly within the terms and spirit of the exemptions[;]" (2) the employer bears the burden of proof; and (3) "if there is at least a reasonable doubt with respect to whether the employees meet the first criterion for primary duty, the exemption should not be applied based on the first criterion."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Arbitrator, exercising the authority conferred on arbitrators under <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, properly applied OPM's FLSA regulations governing the exemption of administrative employees. Further, we conclude that the Arbitrator properly declined to accept the opinions of Agency witnesses in reaching his decision that the grievants are not exempt from FLSA coverage because they are administrative employees under the OPM regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's contention, the case before us does not concern a matter that is governed by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>. In <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the Court addressed a challenge to certain regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency implementing the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977. The Court held that, in deciding cases involving the interpretation of an unclear statutory term, a court must decide whether the responsible agency's regulation "is based on a permissible construction of the statute." 467 U.S. at 843. The Court further held that "[s]uch legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 844 (footnote omitted). However, unlike <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, this case does not concern the validity or the interpretation of OPM's regulations governing exemptions from the FLSA. Rather, the case concerns the Arbitrator's resolution of the Union's grievance claiming that the Agency applied those regulations incorrectly. As the Claims Court held in <span class="Italic">Ackerman v. U.S.</span>, a broad exclusion from a grievance procedure that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">addresses <span class="Italic">interpretation</span> of [F]ederal law and regulations, and plaintiffs' claim does not dispute interpretation of [F]ederal law or regulations, but rather their <span class="Italic">application</span>. The statutory definition of "grievance" recognizes the distinction between misinterpretation and misapplication. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii). OPM regulations confer on the agency the duty of applying the FLSA exemptions to its employees. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.201.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">21 Cl. Ct. at 490 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not modify or invalidate OPM's FLSA regulations, nor did he fail to give the regulations due deference. The Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator was required to follow OPM's decision letter of 1976 or the testimony of the OPM employee at the arbitration hearing in resolving the fact-specific issue before him. OPM's regulations set the criteria for determining whether Federal employees are exempt from FLSA coverage, but the regulations do not make the fact-specific determinations with regard to the exemptions of specific employees. Moreover, as the court noted in <span class="Italic">Ackerman v. U.S.</span>, "OPM regulations confer on the agency the duty of applying the FLSA exemptions to its employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 490. In addition, the court held that "local, fact-specific issues...are best suited to the grievance procedures provided by the [collective bargaining agreement]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 489. Therefore, we conclude that the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator failed to give OPM's regulations proper deference provides no basis for finding the award deficient. In our view, this argument is mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence in deciding the issue before him. Such disagreement provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The Award Is Not Contrary to the Back Pay Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an employee found to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the loss of pay or differentials "is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect" the pay or differentials that the employee would otherwise have received if the personnel action had not occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A). The Agency maintains that the Arbitrator could not order an award of backpay because there was no unjustified or unwarranted personnel action taken against the grievant. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act requires backpay for the amount of pay or differentials lost by an employee due to an agency's unwarranted or unjustified personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A). The failure of an agency to pay employees monies to which they are entitled constitutes an unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council and U.S. Department of the Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire</span>, 39 FLRA 3, 7 (1991). An arbitrator can properly award backpay to remedy an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the loss of a differential, such as overtime pay, that employees otherwise would have received.... Backpay is authorized for violations of the overtime provisions of the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Association of Firefighters, Local 13 and Panama Canal Commission, General Services Bureau, Balboa, Republic of Panama</span>, 43 FLRA 1012, 1026 (1992). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the grievants had been affected by the Agency's unjustified personnel action that improperly classified them as exempt from coverage under the FLSA. He ruled that the grievants were entitled to backpay for the amount of overtime pay that they would have received "but for the Agency's illegal designation that they were exempt from coverage under the FLSA, for a back pay period and in a manner to be determined." Therefore, we conclude that the Arbitrator made the proper findings for an award of backpay and there is no basis on which to find the award deficient under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In holding that the Arbitrator's award of backpay is not contrary to the Back Pay Act, we reject OPM's argument that under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259 the Agency should not be held liable for an FLSA violation because the Agency relied on the regulations and rulings of OPM. That provision protects from liability employers who rely in good faith on FLSA administrative rulings and regulations issued by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the DOL. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259(b)(1). OPM cites <span class="Italic">Palardy</span> in support of its argument that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259 applies to the FLSA regulations issued by OPM and maintains that agencies relying in good faith on OPM interpretations of its FLSA regulations should be protected from liability. The Union contends that the decision of the Claims Court in <span class="Italic">Abundis</span> is controlling in this case and that the plain language of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259 refers only to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The holdings of <span class="Italic">Abundis</span> and <span class="Italic">Palardy</span> "are in opposition." <span class="Italic">Campbell v. U.S. Air Force</span>, 755 F. Supp. 897, 901 (E.D. Cal. 1990). We agree with the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Abundis</span> that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259 "is explicit in requiring that the regulation relied upon be one issued by the 'Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.'" 15 Cl. Ct. at 510. Although recognizing the authority of OPM to issue regulations to administer the FLSA for Federal employees, the court did not accept the contention that section 259 applies to Federal agencies. The court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[N]otwithstanding OPM's authority to "administer" the FLSA with respect to federal agencies, it is still not "the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor." The exception created by section 259 is very precise. It is limited to circumstances in which regulations are adopted by the "Administrator," the office created in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204(a). To apply the statute to a regulation issued by OPM, an agency not referred to, would be to extend the exception beyond its scope.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 511....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Claims Court that "the exception created by [29 U.S.C. <span id="page_2109"></span>&#x00A7;] 259 is very precise" and "is limited to circumstances in which regulations are adopted by the Administrator [of the Wage and Hour Division]." 15 Cl. Ct. at 511. As the regulations applied by the Agency in this case were issued by OPM and not the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, the Agency cannot use the defense in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259.</p>

<p class="noindent">Essential to the integrity of an overtime award under the FLSA or the FEPA is a demonstration that the statutory conditions for overtime entitlement were met.

Regulatory conditions may also be controlling. In <span class="Italic">Doe v. United States</span>, 372 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court denied a claim by a class of Justice Department lawyers under FEPA because that agency did not officially order or approve overtime, a condition set by an OPM regulation, 5 CFR 550.111, for recovery of FEPA overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, DCA and NAGE Local R4-45</span>, 54 FLRA 83, 87 (1998), provides an example of an overtime award set aside for lack of statutory authorization in a situation involving workweeks scheduled back-to-back but not exceeding the 40 hour FLSA limitation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 and its implementing regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.111(a), overtime may not be paid unless an employee works more than 40 hours in an administrative workweek or more than 8 hours in a day. In this case, the Arbitrator specifically found, and there is no dispute, "that the grievants did not work more than 5 days, [8 hours on each day,] in any one administrative workweek." The parties do not dispute, in this regard, that the grievants' workweeks properly were designated in advance or that the sixth consecutive workday was the first day of a new administrative workweek. Accordingly, the award is deficient as contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 and its implementing regulations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural</span> <span class="Italic">Research Service, Plum Island Animal Disease Center and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> 1940, 47 FLRA 975, 978 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Sanford</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming the Arbitrator properly found that the Agency's action in changing the grievant's schedules violated the "spirit and intent" of section 610.111, this would not provide a basis for an award of overtime because "no monetary damages can be awarded against the [Government] unless some provision of law commands the payment...." <span class="Italic">Sanford</span>, 752 F.2d at 639. The Arbitrator found no basis for the payment of overtime under the FLSA and there is no dispute on this issue. Further, as discussed above, there is no basis for payment under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a). Consequently, even assuming a violation of section 610.111 [of 5 CFR, requiring agency to set basic workweek of 40 hours not extending over more than 6 of any 7 consecutive days], the award of overtime would be deficient. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 639-40.</p>
<p class="noindent">Overtime entitlement need not be assessed on a case-by-case basis as to statutory or regulatory requirements. An agency may agree in advance, in a negotiated agreement, to pay overtime in "circumstances where such payment is not otherwise prohibited by law and/or regulation." Nothing precludes an agency from agreeing to a blanket authorization of overtime pay to employees granted official time to attend and make presentations at grievance meetings. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq., XVIII Airborne Corps, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 41 FLRA 62, 67 (1991). Overtime restrictions may follow other statutes, e.g., "[u]nder the Work Schedules Act, an agency is prohibited from making overtime payments for 'hours which constitute a compressed schedule.'" <span class="Italic">FAA, Little Rock Air Traffic Control Tower and NATCA</span>, 51 FLRA 1046, 1050 (1996) (setting aside arbitration award); 5 USC 6128(a).

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator will need to write an award explicitly and specifically demonstrating entitlement to overtime and back pay if the award is to survive agency exceptions. It will not do for the arbitrator to write a summary award granting overtime compensation. The arbitrator must ensure that his or her award reflects statutory requirements governing pay claims, much the same as an arbitrator awarding counsel fees must make explicit findings satisfying statutory criteria. FLRA pointed out what can happen to an unspecific award in <span class="Italic">DLA, DOD, DLA, Defense Distribution Region W., Stockton and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 48 FLRA 221, 222-24 (1993), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 48 FLRA 543 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Arbitrator noted that the parties had presented extensive evidence and testimony during the hearing in support of their respective positions. The Arbitrator found that "it would not serve the best interests of the parties to set forth a lengthy opinion summarizing the evidence and analyzing this case except to state that, at the arbitration hearing, due process was afforded to the [g]rievants and the [Agency]." The Arbitrator stated that he had "carefully weighed all the evidence of record and conclude[d] that the grievances must be sustained." The Arbitrator made the following award:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The grievances are sustained.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The [Agency] shall pay each [g]rievant 17 hours of pay at the overtime rate but without any Sunday premium pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, an award of backpay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials; and (3) but for such action, the employee would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Pine Bluff Arsenal, Arkansas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 953</span>, 47 FLRA 626, 628-29 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Pine Bluff Arsenal</span>). The finding of a direct causal connection required under the Back Pay Act may be implicit from the record and the award. <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Lodge 2261 and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2185 and U.S. Department of the Army, Tooele Army Depot, Tooele, Utah</span>, 47 FLRA 427, 434 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated that the dispute before him centered on whether the grievants were entitled to be assigned overtime work on the 2 days in question, as well as whether the grievants were available to perform such overtime work. The Arbitrator further stated that he "carefully weighed all the evidence of record and conclude[d] that the grievances must be sustained." By sustaining the grievances, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievants were entitled to, and available to perform, overtime. However, the Arbitrator did not state the basis for his finding that the grievants were entitled to overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first part of the test set forth above for determining whether an award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act, an arbitrator must find that an aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. In this regard, a violation of an applicable law, rule, regulation or provision of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Pine Bluff Arsenal</span>, 47 FLRA at 629. In the case before us, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency's denial of overtime to the <span id="page_2110"></span>grievants constituted a violation of an applicable law, rule, regulation or provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that there is nothing in the Arbitrator's award that indicates the basis of the grievances. In particular, there is no indication that the Union alleged a violation of a specific contract provision or a violation of a specific provision of law or regulation. Therefore, we have no basis on which to conclude that, in sustaining the grievance, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated law, rule, regulation or the collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, inasmuch as the award does not contain a finding that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, we find that the award does not satisfy the first part of the test set forth above for determining whether an award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the fact that this case was processed through the parties' expedited arbitration procedure did not relieve the Arbitrator of the obligation to satisfy the Back Pay Act requirements. An award of backpay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that the requirements of the Back Pay Act are satisfied....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that the award does not contain the findings necessary to sustain an award of backpay under the Back Pay Act, we conclude that the Arbitrator's award of 17 hours of overtime to the grievants is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, we will set the award aside....</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may not award nominal damages for denial of equal overtime distribution. There must be a finding that, but for the agency's violation of the agreement, each grievant would have worked and been paid for the hours of overtime awarded. <span class="Italic">Army Aberdeen Proving Ground and IAM Local 2424</span>, 19 FLRA 258, 258-59 (1985). An arbitrator cannot award a remedy in the nature of back pay because the agency requires (and presumably pays for) employees to work more consecutive days than the contract allows. If overtime is not legally or contractually required, it cannot be awarded. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 35 FLRA 206, 211 (1990). An award of overtime cannot rest on the "harmful error rule." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 35 FLRA 1267, 1270 (1990).

<p class="noindent">Overtime is authorized under 5 USC 5542 for work performed at home, according to decisions of the Comptroller General, 65 Comp. Gen. 49 (1985); Comp. Gen. No. B-205118 (Mar. 8, 1982); Comp. Gen.

That the overtime was not authorized in writing was not fatal to the claim, for the Court of Claims ruled in <span class="Italic">Byrnes v. United States</span>, 163 Ct. Cl. 167 (1964), that a regulatory requirement for specific written authority for overtime could not avoid the plain requirement of the statute for overtime pay when the performance of the overtime is induced by the government. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manning v. United States</span>, 10 Cl. Ct. 651, 663 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, employees must establish the performance of the claimed work and its duration.

<p class="noindent">Although most FLRA decisions overturning overtime awards cost the grievant, there are exceptions. An award was set aside and corrected that failed to award FLSA overtime for pre-shift and post-shift work of correctional employees. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Med. Ctr. for Fed. Prisoners and AFGE Local 1612</span>, 11 FLRA 29, 30 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council 236</span>, 37 FLRA 481, 484-49 (1990) (setting aside award denying overtime to law enforcement officers who claimed compensation for time spent collecting and turning in weapons and other equipment before and after assigned shifts); <span class="Italic">Fed.

<p class="noindent">As to other components of substantive analysis of the FLSA, FLRA allows arbitrators to fashion remedies that appear to effectuate the purpose of the contract, the FLSA, and the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 32 FLRA 771, 774-75 (1988) (no award for pre-shift or post-shift work when employees failed to adhere to orders stating when work should be performed). An arbitrator may direct offers of opportunities to do overtime without violating management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 40</span>, 18 FLRA 412, 413-14 (1985). An arbitrator may find a contract violation, state a broad remedy, e.g., require payment of overtime, and leave it to the parties to determine what is owed. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 55 FLRA 553, 559-60 (1999), the arbitrator's award of a general remedy was sustained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was effected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, </span>54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998) (Authority clarified that a requirement that the pay loss would not have occurred but for the unwarranted action is not a separate, independent requirement of the Act, but merely amplifies the causal connection requirement of the Act). A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Department of Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools and Federal Education Association, </span>54 FLRA 773, 785 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first requirement for back pay awards, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated sections 8, 9 and 11 of the Regional Agreement and sections 9, 10 and 12 of the National Agreement. Therefore, the Arbitrator made sufficient findings to warrant a conclusion that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second requirement for back pay awards, the Authority has found that missed overtime pay constitutes a withdrawal or reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service,</span> <span class="Italic">Portland, Oregon and National Treasury Employees</span> <span class="Italic">Union, Chapter 156, </span>54 FLRA 764, 770-71 (1998). The Agency contends, however, that the Arbitrator did not make the requisite findings to justify an award of back pay because the findings that the Arbitrator made were too speculative and fail to include a determination that the affected employees would actually have been assigned to staff the exit gates. We find no merit in the Agency's contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the remedy portion of the award, the Arbitrator specifically found that "by utilizing [National Guard] personnel at the exit gate[s] unaccompanied by a Customs employee[,] [the Agency] violated both the Regional and National Agreements...." The Arbitrator further found that "the Agency's violation of the Agreements resulted in a loss in overtime pay to adversely affected Customs employees, and that but for the Agency's violation of the Agreement[s], the adversely affected employees would not have suffered a loss in overtime pay." Consistent with Authority precedent as set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice,</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Sheridan, Oregon and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3979</span>, 55 FLRA 28, 29 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FCI</span>), these arbitral findings sufficiently identified the specific circumstances under which Customs employees were entitled to backpay. There is no additional requirement for the Arbitrator to have identified specific employees. <span class="Italic">See Federal Employees Metal</span> <span class="Italic">Trades Council, Local 831 and U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy, Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, California, </span>39 FLRA 1456, 1459 (1991) (when an arbitrator has found the specific circumstances giving rise to an entitlement to backpay, there is no requirement in the Act or its implementing regulations for the arbitrator to identify the specific employees entitled to backpay as a result of the unwarranted action); <span class="Italic">Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union, </span>13 FLRA 386, 387 (1983) (arbitrator made the necessary findings for an award of backpay because he determined that when overtime had been assigned in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, unit employees were available to perform such work; there is no requirement under the Act to identify any specific employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, contrary to the Agency's assertions, the terms of the award ensure its consistency with the Act. Pursuant to the award, the Agency is only required to compensate employees for lost overtime pay for the dates between July 31, 1991, and September 15, 1993, on which it assigned National Guard personnel to staff the BOTA and Ysleta exit gates but failed to also assign a Customs employee. Moreover, the Agency's complaint about the absence of appropriate records to substantiate the award does not implicate the requirements of the Act, but rather implicates a matter of compliance and implementation. <span class="Italic">See FCI, </span>55 FLRA at 29. Accordingly, the Agency's contentions regarding the Back Pay Act must be rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 57 FLRA 724, 727 (2002) (arbitrator could direct parties to identify specific employees entitled to back pay, even when arbitrator was not asked to specify employees in compliance issues leading to supplemental award).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">[W]e take this opportunity to clarify applicable principles as to the payment of overtime to employees who are in a leave with pay status. <span id="page_2111"></span>We agree with the Agency that the Arbitrator correctly relied on <span class="Italic">Landhart</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Horner</span>, 818 F.2d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1987)] in formulating his award with respect to firefighters, who work an uncommon tour of duty, accrue leave for working overtime periods, and are charged leave for absences during regularly scheduled overtime. They are entitled to receive pay for regularly scheduled and recurrent overtime when they are in a leave with pay status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike firefighters, however, other GS nonexempt employees who work a regular tour of duty do not accrue leave for performing overtime work and are not charged leave for absences during overtime. In <span class="Italic">Armitage</span> [<span class="Italic">v. United States</span>, 23 Cl. Ct. 483 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd in</span> <span class="Italic">part</span>, 991 F.2d 746 (Fed. Cir. 1993)], the court ruled on these employees' entitlement to overtime when in a leave with pay status during which they were not charged leave for not working the overtime. The court held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]t was not improper for the defendant not to credit plaintiffs' leave accounts for hours of overtime regularly worked and not to debit their accounts for hours of unworked overtime while on authorized absence. Since the plaintiffs were not on leave they are not entitled to overtime under the leave with pay statutes or the rationale of <span class="Italic">Lanehart</span>. Moreover, plaintiffs are not entitled to overtime pay under the Title 5 overtime provisions, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542, or the FLSA overtime provision, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207.... Accordingly, if the employee did not work overtime, the overtime pay statutes do not entitle him to pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Armitage</span>, 23 Cl. Ct. at 492. Under <span class="Italic">Armitage</span>, GS nonexempt employees who work a regular tour of duty and who are not charged leave for absences during overtime assignments are not entitled to overtime pay when they are in a leave with pay status.</p>
<p class="noindent">Addressing overtime entitlement for firefighters, under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1815 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Rucker</span>, 56 FLRA 992, 993-94 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy,</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, Tex., </span>36 FLRA 935, 937-39 (1990), the work schedules of federal firefighters are different from the schedules of the typical general schedule employee. Unlike the typical general schedule employee who is scheduled for a 40-hour workweek, firefighters typically work several extended shifts in every 14-day work period. As noted, the grievants in this case have a biweekly tour of duty of five 18-hour shifts. Also unlike the typical general schedule employee who is on duty for all working hours, the shifts of firefighters typically consist of periods of work and periods of standby. In this case, the schedule of each workday is for 8 hours of work and 10 hours of standby duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress provided for these differences in work schedules in the statutes governing the compensation of firefighters.[2] Firefighters receive basic general schedule pay and, in addition, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(1), they typically receive annual premium pay of up to 25 percent of their basic pay in recognition of the substantial portion of their regularly scheduled duty spent in standby status. This pay structure is based solely on provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code and existed prior to amendments to the FLSA to include federal firefighters within its coverage.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;New firefighter pay provisions were established by section 628 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, as incorporated in section 101(b) of Pub. L. No. 105-277, the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Appropriations Act, 1999, which was approved on October 1, 1998. Effective on the first pay period beginning on or after October 1, 1998, the new law made significant changes in how firefighter pay is computed. However, it only applies to firefighters whose regularly established workweeks average 53 hours or more. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. part 550, subpart M. Accordingly, as the grievants' biweekly tour of duty is only 90 hours, the new pay provisions do not apply in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7(a) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(a), employees who are covered by the FLSA are entitled to receive overtime compensation for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek at a rate of one and one-half times their regular rate. However, under section 7(k), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(k), a federal firefighter's "overtime period" is calculated based on tours of duty in excess of a statutorily defined maximum work period rather than hours worked in excess of a 40-hour workweek. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(k) (text included in the appendix). The overtime standard for the application of section 7(k) in terms of the biweekly tour of duty in this case is 106 hours. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(k); 48 Fed. Reg. 40,518 (1983) (text included in the appendix).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The applicability of section 7(k) is reflected in the overtime provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.501. Under these provisions, a firefighter who receives annual premium pay for standby duty under section 5545(c)(1) is not entitled to receive overtime under the FLSA on the basis of work in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.501(a)(5) (text included in the appendix). This approach to compensation of firefighters is reiterated in section 551.541, which specifies that for firefighters who are receiving annual premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) and who are covered by the FLSA, their FLSA overtime standards are those specified in section 7(k). <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.541(a) (text included in the appendix). In addition, firefighters who are covered by the FLSA have their overtime compensation computed solely under the FLSA, without regard to the overtime provisions of title 5. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency,</span> <span class="Italic">Aerospace Ctr. St. Louis, Mo., </span>43 FLRA 147, 148 n.1 (1991) (the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 eliminated the requirement to perform overtime computations under both title 5 and the FLSA for covered employees; instead, overtime pay for employees covered by the FLSA is to be computed only under the FLSA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An examination of this compensation scheme for federal firefighters who are covered by the FLSA and who are receiving annual premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) persuades us that this case is governed by the overtime standards of section 7(k) of the FLSA. We reach this conclusion even though the parties and the Arbitrator never mention the grievants' entitlement to overtime in terms of section 7(k). In sum, we apply section 7(k) as the overtime standard for this case and conclude that the Union fails to establish any entitlement to overtime compensation under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the grievants are receiving annual premium pay under section 5545(c)(1), to be entitled to overtime pay under the FLSA, the grievants must meet the applicable standard of section 7(k). The standard of section 7(k) for a biweekly tour of duty is 106 hours. Thus, even when, in accordance with section 551.541, every hour of their tour of duty is considered in determining whether they are entitled to overtime compensation, the grievants' 90-hour biweekly tour of duty is short of the standard of 106 hours. Therefore, even though the Arbitrator did not analyze this case in terms of section 7(k), the Union has not established that the Arbitrator's failure to award the grievants overtime compensation is contrary to the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, although the Union contends in its exception that the grievants were entitled to night differential pay, the Union does not address its basis for claiming night differential pay. However, we note that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.163(a) (text included in the appendix), employees receiving annual premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) may not receive premium pay for night work. Consequently, the Union has not established that the Arbitrator's failure to award the grievants night differential pay is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 529 and Dept. of Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs Memphis</span>, 57 FLRA 784, 785 (2002), noted that the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA) amended Title 5 to provide that federal employees who are covered by the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA are not subject to overtime pay rates and computations established in 5 USC 5542(a). OPM implementing regulations are found at 5 CFR 550.101(c) (2022). Concerning "roll-call" pay, refer to <span class="Italic">Abbott v. United States</span>, 204 F.3d 1099, 1101-03 (Fed.

<p class="noindent">There may be limitations on overtime earnings, and FLRA will review on exceptions assertions that an award violates statutory limitations on pay. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 55 FLRA 553, 560 (1999), rejected an argument that an award of overtime under the Customs Officers Pay Reform Act was barred by a statutory pay cap:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also submits that compliance with the award in this case would result in an illegal windfall of overtime pay for employees who have reached the statutory pay cap because it contains no statutory restrictions on overtime pay.&#x2003;In support of this position, the Agency relies on 19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 267, the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, and Article 22 of the parties' Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 267 concerns overtime and premium pay for Customs employees. As relevant here, section 267(c) provides that the aggregate of overtime and premium pay that a customs officer may receive in any fiscal year may not exceed $25,000. Notwithstanding this statutory limitation, however, the regulations implementing section 267 include a number of exceptions. In particular, 19 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 24.16(h) specifically provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">However, compensation awarded to a Customs Officer for work not performed, which includes overtime awards during military leave or court leave, continuation of pay under workers compensation law, and awards made in accordance with back pay settlements, shall not be applied to any applicable pay cap calculations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Agency's assertion that the award is contrary to 19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 267 and its implementing regulations must be rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As concerns the Agency's claim that the award is contrary to the statutory earnings limitations set forth in the Back Pay Act, the Agency has provided no explanation for this assertion. In addition, the Agency claims that the award violates Article 22 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, but the Agency also provides no explanation to support this assertion. Nor does it provide a copy of the agreement. Consequently, these arguments are without merit.</p>
