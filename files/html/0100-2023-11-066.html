<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-67"><span class="space">6.</span> Expert Witness; Medical Evidence</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Although not controlling on Board proceedings, Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides the parameters of the admissibility of expert testimony:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Testimony by Expert Witnesses</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal Rule of Evidence 703 adds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bases of an Expert's Opinion Testimony</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the <span id="Page_1491"></span>expert has been made aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted. But if the facts or data would otherwise be inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose them to the jury only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under Rule 702, the trial judge determining the admissibility of scientific testimony must determine whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue. That determination entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology can properly be applied to the facts in issue. Some factors bearing on that inquiry were catalogued in <span class="Italic">Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 2796-97 (1993):</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">1.</span> Whether the theory or technique has been tested;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">2.</span> Whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">3.</span> Whether a given technique has achieved general acceptance; and</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">4.</span> The known or potential rate of error for a particular scientific technique.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Daubert</span> analysis, involving scientific testimony, is applied to testimony based on technical or other specialized knowledge. <span class="Italic">Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 1175-76 (1999), expanded on <span class="Italic">Daubert</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[<span class="Italic">Daubert</span>] made clear that its list of factors was meant to be helpful, not definitive. Indeed, those factors do not all necessarily apply even in every instance in which the reliability of scientific testimony is challenged. It might not be surprising in a particular case, for example, that a claim made by a scientific witness has never been the subject of peer review, for the particular application at issue may never previously have interested any scientist. Nor, on the other hand, does the presence of <span class="Italic">Daubert's</span> general acceptance factor help show that an expert's testimony is reliable where the discipline itself lacks reliability, as, for example, do theories grounded in any so-called generally accepted principles of astrology or necromancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time, and contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, some of <span class="Italic">Daubert's</span> questions can help to evaluate the reliability even of experience-based testimony. In certain cases, it will be appropriate for the trial judge to ask, for example, how often an engineering expert's experience-based methodology has produced erroneous results, or whether such a method is generally accepted in the relevant engineering community. Likewise, it will at times be useful to ask even of a witness whose expertise is based purely on experience, say, a perfume tester able to distinguish among 140 odors at a sniff, whether his preparation is of a kind that others in the field would recognize as acceptable.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Of expert testimony, the Federal Circuit opined in a patent infringement case, <span class="Italic">Summit 6, LLC v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd</span>., 802 F.3d 1283, 1295-98 (Fed. Cir. 2015), with some emphasis on law developed in the Fifth Circuit, the venue of the underlying lawsuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Daubert,</span> the Supreme Court set out the requirements for admissibility of expert testimony. 509 U.S. 579 (1993). The Supreme Court stated that the trial judge plays a "gatekeeping role," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 597, which "entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 592-93. The Court emphasized that the focus "must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions that they generate." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 595. This admissibility assessment, while a flexible one, may consider the following factors: (1) whether the methodology is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact; (2) whether the methodology has been tested; (3) whether the methodology has been published in peer-reviewed journals; (4) whether there is a known, potential rate of error; and (5) whether the methodology is generally accepted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 591-95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The admissibility of expert evidence is also governed by Rules 702 and 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. "Rule 702 was amended in response to <span class="Italic">Daubert</span> and cases applying it, including <span class="Italic">Kumho Tire</span>." <span class="Italic">Micro Chem.,</span> 317 F.3d at 1391 (citing <span class="Italic">Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,</span> 526 U.S. 137, 150 (1999))....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these rules, a district court may exclude evidence that is based upon unreliable principles or methods, legally insufficient facts and data, or where the reasoning or methodology is not sufficiently tied to the facts of the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kumho Tire,</span> 526 U.S. at 150 (the gatekeeping inquiry must be tied to the particular facts of the case); <span class="Italic">i4i Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp.,</span> 598 F.3d 831, 854 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (stating that "<span class="Italic">Daubert</span> and Rule 702 are safeguards against unreliable or irrelevant opinions, not guarantees of correctness"). But the question of whether the expert is credible or the opinion is correct is generally a question for the fact finder, not the court. <span class="Italic">Apple Inc. v. Motorola, Inc.,</span> 757 F.3d 1286, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2014), <span class="Italic">overruled en banc in part not relevant here, Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC,</span> 792 F.3d 1339, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Indeed, "[v]igorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence." <span class="Italic">Daubert,</span> 509 U.S. at 596.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All approaches have certain strengths and weaknesses, and, depending upon the facts, one or all may produce admissible testimony in a particular case. Because each case presents unique circumstances and facts, it is common for parties to choose different, reliable approaches in a single case and, when they do, the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach may be exposed at trial or attacked during cross-examination. That one approach may better account for one aspect of a royalty estimation does not make other approaches inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, while all approximations involve some degree of uncertainty, the admissibility inquiry centers on whether the methodology employed is reliable. <span class="Italic">Daubert,</span> 509 U.S. at 589-595. A distinct but integral part of that inquiry is whether the data utilized in the methodology is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case. <span class="Italic">Kumho Tire,</span> 526 U.S. at 150. Hence, a reasonable or scientifically valid methodology is nonetheless unreliable where the data used is not sufficiently tied to the facts of the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., LaserDynamics, Inc. v. Quanta Computer, Inc.,</span> 694 F.3d 51, 78-81 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (granting a new trial because damages testimony relied upon licenses that were not comparable and therefore not relevant). Likewise, ideal input data cannot save a methodology that is plagued by logical deficiencies or is otherwise unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Daubert,</span> 509 U.S. at 592-93 (the court must make "a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly <span class="Italic">can be</span> applied to the facts in issue) (emphasis added). But where the methodology is reasonable and its data or evidence are sufficiently tied to the facts of the case, the gatekeeping role of the court is satisfied, and the inquiry on the correctness of the methodology and of the results produced thereunder belongs to the factfinder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Daubert,</span> The Supreme Court has delineated certain factors to assist courts in evaluating the foundation of a given expert's testimony, while carefully emphasizing the non-exhaustive nature of these factors. Suggested considerations include whether the theory or technique the expert employs is generally accepted, whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication, whether the theory can and has been tested, whether the known or potential rate of error is acceptable, and whether there are standards controlling the technique's operation. As the Fifth Circuit has noted, "[T]here is no formula, and the court must judge admissibility based on the particular facts of the case." <span class="Italic">Wells v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,</span> 601 F.3d 375, 378-79 (5th Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has called the inquiry envisioned by Rule 702 a "flexible one" and indicated that these factors may be considered, but are not exhaustive. <span class="Italic">Daubert,</span> 509 U.S. at 594. The Fifth Circuit has held expert testimony admissible even though multiple <span class="Italic">Daubert</span> factors were <span id="Page_1492"></span>not satisfied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Norris,</span> 217 F.3d 262, 269-71 (5th Cir. 2000). Still, the Supreme Court has warned that we must not "deny the importance of Daubert's gatekeeping requirement. The objective of that requirement is to ensure the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony." <span class="Italic">Kumho Tire,</span> 526 U.S. at 152.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted that it is the trier of fact, not an expert, who determines the facts necessary for adjudication, <span class="Italic">Del Mar Avionics, Inc. v. Quinton Instrument Co</span>., 836 F.2d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A district court is not obliged to adopt a conclusion stated by an expert witness, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Minnesota Mining &#x0026; Mfg. Co. v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's internal guidance on the use of expert witnesses and presentation of expert testimony is provided by its <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span> (a source of guidance still used by the Board for training and orientation, even though it has been superseded by the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>). The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> states, at 20-21:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">E.&#x2003;EXPERT WITNESSES</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;Discovery of Expert Witness</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Name of expert witness and statement of testimony can be obtained through discovery and in response to the Board's hearing and prehearing orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fed. R. Evid. 702 provides for expert testimony if the subject matter is one of scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge and would assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Qualification As Expert</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify as an expert, a witness must have specialized knowledge, skill, expertise, training or education on the subject to which his testimony relates. Fed. R. Evid. 702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The party introducing expert witness testimony has the burden of laying a foundation qualifying the witness as an expert.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify a witness as an expert, counsel should question the witness as to: present occupation, academic background, occupational history, including experience and related testing or training; licenses or special honors or group association; publications, if any; teaching experience; and any other special familiarity or experience with the subject matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel must lay a proper foundation for all materials, depositions, testimony, exhibits, examinations, tests, research, etc. that the expert used to support his opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Administrative Judge's Determination of Qualifications</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;After hearing the witness' qualifications the AJ should allow <span class="Italic">voir dire</span> by opposing counsel and any objections as to the witness' qualifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;At the conclusion of the qualifying testimony, the AJ should either accept or reject the witness as an expert.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Limiting Number of Experts</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;The AJ has the authority to limit the number of witnesses who will testify on any issue where testimony of the witnesses would be irrelevant, immaterial or repetitious. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;Permissible Opinion Testimony</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An expert witness must possess a reasonable probability regarding his opinion or conclusion. Any mere guess or speculation is inadmissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Expert opinion testimony must be based on proper factual foundations obtained from the expert's own observation, facts presented at the hearing through hypothetical questions, or facts supplied to him outside the courtroom. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Evid. 703.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Methods of Asking</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;A qualified expert may answer hypothetical questions and testify from facts or data perceived by him and information that is made known to him at or before the hearing. <span class="Italic">Teen-Ed., Inc. v. Kimball International Inc.</span>, 620 F.2d 399, 402 (3rd Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;Cross-examination</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Scope</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An expert may always be cross-examined as to interest, bias and prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Limitations</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An AJ's limitation on the scope of examination is not improper even though not prescribed by the Federal Rules [of] Evidence. <span class="Italic">Behensky v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 MSPR 690, 696 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;Appointment of Expert by the Administrative Judge</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is proper to appoint an expert when the opinion would assist the AJ in understanding the evidence or determining a fact in issue and where the subject is scientific, technical or requires specialized knowledge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has no regulation concerning qualification of expert witnesses; its decisions provide little guidance on who is and who is not an expert. In <span class="Italic">Spicer v. DOD</span>, 59 MSPR 359, 366 (1993), a constructive downgrading appeal involving testimony from witnesses familiar with position classification, the Board offered the observation that the testimony of a particular witness was "entitled to greater probative value than the testimony of witnesses who were not declared by the administrative judge to be experts." To have an expert "declared" an expert: have the witness testify as to his qualifications, offer the witness for cross-examination on qualifications, ask the AJ to "declare" or "accept" the witness as an expert, and, having received the desired response, move on to the substance of the expert's testimony. Some AJs may not go through the exercise of declaring a witness to be an expert, preferring to listen to and evaluate the testimony of the witness without attributing a particular appellation to the witness. The Federal Circuit determined there was no reversible error when the AJ excluded preferred expert testimony, but the AJ allowed that witness to testify as a nonexpert and "present a broad scope of testimony." <span class="Italic">Schwab v. OPM</span>, 232 Fed. Appx. 980, 981 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerns about an expert witness should be presented to the AJ through timely objections, as <span class="Italic">Cupo v. Dept. of Army,</span> AT-0752-10-0330-I-1 (NP 2/11/2011), illustrates concerning a witness testifying about drug test results:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant additionally challenges Cathy Stevenson Jolin's substitution for Dale Haak, Ph.D., at the hearing and her designation as an expert witness. At no time during the hearing, however, did the appellant object to the testimony of Ms. Jolin or to her classification as an expert witness. Indeed, the appellant, through his representative, unambiguously stipulated to Ms. Jolin's designation as an expert witness prior to her hearing testimony. Accordingly, the appellant's failure to timely object to Ms. Jolin's substitution as a witness and to her expert status below precludes him from doing so before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Tarpley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 579, 581 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Expert witnesses occasionally find themselves at Board hearings, often physicians testifying about medical conditions or disabilities. Their evidence is desirable; frequently, it is it is provided through medical reports alone. Although the Board allows expert testimony, it is not binding. An AJ is free to reject the opinion of a witness offered as an expert, as long as the AJ offers reasoned factfinding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 641, 644 (1992) (AJ declined to give any weight to the testimony of a classification expert); <span class="Italic">Walden v. OPM</span>, 14 MSPR 378, 379 (1983) (AJ declined to credit expert testimony concerning the nature of a work assignment given to the appellant when the expert's testimony relied on a series of assumptions, two being contrary to the facts of the record).

Sharp Electronics Corp</span>., 992 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2021).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Appellants who <span class="Italic">seek</span> to call government employees on their behalf as expert witnesses should be mindful of a provision in the government-wide standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635.805 (2022):</p>
