<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-388"><span class="space">1.</span> Evidence of Material, Intentional False Statement, or Deception or Fraud</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under OPM's regulation, 5 CFR 731.103(g) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM retains jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions in all suitability cases where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. OPM also retains jurisdiction over all suitability cases involving a refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for suitability determinations and suitability actions under this authority. Although no prior approval is needed, notification to OPM is required if the agency wants to take, or has taken, action under its own authority (5 CFR part 315, 5 CFR part 359, or 5 CFR part 752) in cases involving material, intentional false statement in examination or appointment, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment; or refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this title. In addition, paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction under this part in any case it deems necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may take action against the individual without OPM involvement, other than notice to OPM, for false statement, deception or fraud concerning examination or appointment if the agency does so under a different authority, e.g., termination of a probationer for preappointment condition or adverse action under 5 CFR Part 752. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Dept. of Army</span>, 111 MSPR 529, 531 &#x00B6; 20, 2009 MSPB 118 (2009), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. <span class="Italic">Lindsay v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> SF-0752-10-0771-I-1 (NP 6/14/2011), implied that the agency may determine the route it follows as to a probationer's termination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant also reiterates his argument from below that his removal was based on a suitability determination and is thus governed by 5 C.F.R. Part 731. He contends that the Board, therefore, has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(7), which provides the Board with jurisdiction over the disqualification of an employee or applicant because of a suitability determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the agency took this action pursuant to its authority to terminate probationary employees under 5 C.F.R. Part 315. When adjudicating an appeal of an agency action, the Board must assess the agency's action under the procedures elected by the agency and may not hold the agency to standards relating to a legal authority that the agency did not invoke. <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 17 (2009). Because the agency based the appellant's termination on 5 C.F.R. Part 315, not on 5 C.F.R. Part 731, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(7) does not provide the Board with jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Shah v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-10-0543-I-1 (NP 3/3/2011) ("OPM has not delegated authority to employing agencies to take suitability actions in matters involving 'material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment,' or involving 'employees' who served more than 1 year in a position subject to a suitability investigation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.101, 731.103(a), (g). Thus, the appellant cannot appeal to the Board pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier OPM regulations reserved to OPM the determination that an individual is unsuitable by reason of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. If an agency issued a suitability determination against an individual for that reason, the Board was without jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal by the individual because only OPM could issue an appealable suitability determination based on those substantive reasons. <span class="Italic">Saunders v. DOJ</span>, 95 MSPR 38, 41-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2003), explained the regulatory structure and the background and jurisdictional impact of the OPM regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective January 29, 2001, more than a year before the agency issued its February 15, 2002 proposal to find the appellant unsuitable, OPM delegated to agency heads limited authority to make suitability determinations, with certain exceptions, one of which is pertinent here. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.601 (2001). OPM's suitability regulations provide in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 731.103 Delegation to agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; OPM delegates to the heads of agencies limited authority for adjudicating suitability in cases involving applicants for and appointees to competitive service positions in the agency (including limited, agency-specific debarment authority under &#x00A7; 731.205). OPM retains jurisdiction in all competitive service cases involving evidence of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for adjudication or contact OPM for prior approval if the agency wants to take action under its own authority (5 CFR part 315 or 5 CFR part 752)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 731.105 Authority to take suitability actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003; An agency, exercising delegated authority, may take a suitability action under this part against an applicant or appointee based on the criteria of &#x00A7; 731.202 subject to the limitations prescribed in 731.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.103(a), 731.105(b) (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations quoted above indicate that OPM generally has retained jurisdiction to make suitability determinations involving a charge of intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That fact is made even clearer in OPM's comments in the Federal Register when it implemented the current regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 731.103 Delegation to Agencies</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency asked whether agencies to which OPM previously had delegated authority will now be required to refer any cases involving falsification to OPM for adjudication. If so, the agency commented that this would be an additional burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM's policy concerning material falsification cases has not changed. In supplemental guidance issued in 1991 with our current regulations, OPM policy stated, "OPM is responsible for adjudicating all cases (applicants, eligibles, appointees, and employees) involving material, intentional false statement, deception, or fraud in examination or appointment." Additionally, as stated in a 1995 Federal Investigations Notice (FIN 95-1), "All agencies, including those with delegated suitability adjudication authority, should refer any competitive service application situation where there is evidence of intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment process, to the same office (OPM, Federal Investigations Processing Center, Suitability Adjudications Branch)."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">65 Fed. Reg. 82,239 (Dec. 28, 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, OPM conducted a background investigation of the appellant in connection with his application for employment. During the course of this investigation, the agency brought to OPM's attention evidence of arguably inconsistent statements the appellant had made regarding the circumstances under which a previous period of employment had ended. When OPM subsequently forwarded its investigative report to the agency, it indicated that there were "potentially actionable issues" in the report. It did not make a negative suitability determination under its own authority to do so, however; and, although the form by which it forwarded the report indicated that the agency might choose to take "unfavorable action," nothing in that document or elsewhere in the record indicates that OPM ever delegated to the agency any authority to issue a negative suitability determination based on any allegedly false statements the appellant may have made in connection with his employment application. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>[5] As indicated above, the agency nevertheless issued its own proposal and decision to find the appellant <span id="Page_764"></span>unsuitable based on his alleged "false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." Under the circumstances described above, we find that it did not have the authority to do so<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.103(a), 731.105(b) (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The investigative file included evidence that could be regarded as providing a basis for disqualification from employment on grounds other than falsification, deception, or fraud.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations provide that "[a]ny individual who has been found unsuitable for employment may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a) (2001). However, the regulations also provide more specifically that "[a]ny applicant or appointee who is found unsuitable by any <span class="Italic">agency acting under delegated authority from OPM under this part</span> may appeal the adverse suitability decision to the Merit Systems <span id="Page_765"></span>Protection Board." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g) (2001) (emphasis added). The Board has interpreted these regulations to mean that the Board has jurisdiction over a suitability determination made by an agency only where the agency acted within the scope of its delegated authority. <span class="Italic">See Brady v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 94 MSPR 439 &#x00B6; 5 (2003); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v.

Because the agency acted outside the scope of its delegated authority to make a suitability determination, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal of that determination, or over the appellant's appeal of the agency's subsequent reaffirmation of that decision upon remand by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Brady,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 439 &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As in <span class="Italic">Saunders</span>, if an agency informed an applicant for a job that, under the agency's delegated examining authority, it determined the appellant to be unsuitable for employment because of material falsification or omission in the application process, and the employee then appealed that determination to the Board, the Board's dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction on the theory that only OPM should have made the determination through its reserved examining authority, <span class="Italic">Segura v. DHS</span>, 95 MSPR 412, 413, 414-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4-6 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for the position of Border Patrol Agent (Trainee), GS-1896-05. Based on information obtained through a background investigation, the agency proposed and subsequently decided to find the appellant unsuitable for employment for two reasons: "Misconduct or Negligence in Prior Employment" and "Criminal or Dishonest Conduct." The appellant appealed and, after a hearing, the administrative judge (AJ) sustained both reasons for the agency action, affirming the agency's suitability determination and sustaining the appellant's debarment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has delegated to an employing agency the authority to make suitability determinations, the Board has jurisdiction to review them<span class="Italic">. Hester v. U.S. Information Agency</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 39, 40-41 (1988). Here, OPM has made a delegation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a). Such a general delegation, however, is limited, for OPM retains jurisdiction over "all competitive service cases involving evidence of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for adjudication or contact OPM for prior approval if the agency wants to take action under its own authority." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a); <span class="Italic">see Saunders v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 38 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency did not use the specific terminology quoted above, i.e., "material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment," to describe the reason for the suitability determination that is at issue here. In effect, however, it based that reason on evidence of such misconduct. That is, it alleged that the appellant deliberately omitted, from certain documents he was required to complete during the examination process, information that would have a bearing on the agency's decision to hire him or to decline to hire him. We find, therefore, that the agency's suitability determination "involv[ed] evidence of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination" and that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a), the agency lacked the authority to make such determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the regulations grant Board appeal rights to "[a]ny individual who has been found unsuitable for employment," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a), they more specifically provide that "[a]ny applicant or appointee who is found unsuitable by any agency acting under delegated authority from OPM under this part may appeal the adverse suitability decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g). Harmonizing these two regulations, the Board has held that it has jurisdiction over an appeal from a suitability determination made by an agency <span class="Italic">only</span> when the agency acted within the scope of its delegated authority<span class="Italic">. Saunders</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 38 &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Brady v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 439 &#x00B6; 6 (2003); <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. General Services Administration</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 243 &#x00B6; 4 (1999); and others). Because the agency did not have delegated authority to find the appellant unsuitable based on his "criminal or dishonest conduct," we conclude that the Board does not have jurisdiction over this appeal<span class="Italic">. See Brady</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 439 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (the Board lacked jurisdiction over an appeal from a suitability determination that was based, in part, on the allegedly false statements the appellant made during the examination process).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reaffirmed its disinclination to accept jurisdiction over suitability determinations made by agencies other than OPM based on a charge of false or deceptive information to the agency during the application process, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of State</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EDWARDS_MICHAEL_L_DC_0731_04_0270_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248803.pdf">98 MSPR 481</a>, 483-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 5-7 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was tentatively selected for a competitive service GS-0343-13 Program Analyst position with the agency's Bureau of Overseas Building Operations in Washington, D.C. The agency's tentative selection letter informed the appellant that his selection was "contingent on further review of [his] qualifications, suitability and successful completion of a full background investigation." As a result of information obtained during the background investigation, the agency proposed and subsequently found the appellant unsuitable for employment based on "personal conduct" and "financial considerations"; and it terminated his tentative selection effective January 23, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appellant's appeal of the agency's negative suitability determination, the agency chose to rely solely on the "personal conduct" basis for its decision. The "personal conduct" charge was supported by two specifications asserting that: (1) The appellant had intentionally provided false or deceptive information to the agency during the application process; and (2) the appellant had been found ineligible for rehire by another agency. In the initial decision following the hearing on the appellant's appeal, the administrative judge (AJ) found that the agency proved by preponderant evidence both of the specifications supporting the "personal conduct" charge, including that of intentionally providing false or deceptive information during the application process. The AJ found that there is a nexus between an applicant's falsification of employment documents and the efficiency of the service and that the removal of the appellant was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. Accordingly, the AJ sustained the agency's negative suitability determination.</p>
