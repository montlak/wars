<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-164"><span class="space">7.</span> Electronic Filing</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Henderson v. NASA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HENDERSON_ARTHUR_J_AT_0432_08_0792_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_573568.pdf">116 MSPR 96</a>, 100 &#x00B6; 8, 2011 MSPB 12 (2011), noted the Board's system for calculating the date of filing a PFR through the e-filing system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The initial decision informed the parties that a petition for review must be filed on or before December 30, 2009. Because the agency's petition was electronically submitted from the agency's Huntsville, Alabama office at 11:56 <span class="small">P.M.</span> Central Standard Time on December 30, 2009, the last day of the filing period, we find that the agency's petition was timely filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)(1) (all pleadings filed via the Board's e-Appeal Online system are stamped with Eastern Standard Time, but the timeliness of a pleading is assessed based on the time zone where the pleading is being filed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dabner v. EPA</span>, CH-0752-18-0572-I-1 (NP 5/1/2023) (under the regulation, e-filing time of filing is controlled by time zone of the point of filing (Philadelphia-Eastern) and not the location of the office that issued the initial decision (Chicago-Central).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board is to excuse a belated electronic filing, the explanation should be sworn and it should be detailed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Redmon v. Dept. of Interior</span>, CH-3443-14-0264-I-1 (NP 10/29/2014) (rejecting agency reply, at n.3: "The agency filed its response 3 days late, reporting that the delay was the result of 'technical difficulties both with [the representative's] computer and with the MSPB e-file system in addition.' The Board will waive the filing deadline for a response to a petition for review for good cause. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(g). However, we find that the agency's vague, unsworn assertions fail meet that standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchinson v. Department of Labor</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 5 (2001) (the statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence of timeliness); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980) (to establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(g) (late filings must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement explaining the delay)."). <span class="Italic">Isaiah v. DHHS</span>, DE-0752-15-0514-I-1 (NP 5/17/2016) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Isaiah v. MSPB</span>, 665 Fed. Appx. 891 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP)), remarked on the necessity for detailed information explaining how technical issues with the e-filing system prevented a timely PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's representative alleges that he experienced technical difficulties with the Board's e-Appeal system and requests that the Board waive the untimeliness of the petition for review. Under limited circumstances, the Board will excuse delays in filing caused by difficulties encountered with the e-Appeal system. Palermo, 120 M.S.P.R. 694, &#x00B6; 5. However, we find that the appellant's failure to timely file his petition is not excusable under the particular circumstances in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's representative alleges that he logged into the Board's e-Appeal system on November 27, 2015, followed all the instructions, and received data suggesting that his petition for review filing was complete. According to the appellant's representative, he and the appellant subsequently received notifications that the filing had been started but not completed, prompting the appellant to seek technical support and prompting the untimely filing on December 3, 2015. However, he failed to submit a sworn statement or any evidence to corroborate the claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(g) (indicating that a motion to waive the filing deadline should be accompanied by an affidavit or a sworn statement that includes, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing, along with supporting documentation or other evidence). The only evidence provided suggests that the appellant expected his representative to file a timely petition, but was surprised to find otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's representative alleges that he attempted to file the petition for review on November 27, 2015, the Board's e-Appeal logs instead reflect his having begun the process for filing new appeals on November 27 and December 1, 2015, without completing either. Because the process for filing a new appeal does not require entry of a docket number, we are unable to determine whether these actions were intended to correspond with the instant appeal. Nevertheless, even if they were, the e-Appeal system generates an email reminder on each of the 3 days after an appeal is started, warning that the process is not yet completed. <span class="Italic">See Palermo</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 694, &#x00B6; 7. While the appellant's representative seems to concede that he received these email warnings, he has failed to explain why it took a total of 6 days to take corrective action. He suggests that unfamiliarity with the Board's e-Appeal system may have contributed to his untimeliness, but we are not persuaded, given the numerous pleadings he filed through e-Appeal below, and the email warnings generated after starting, but failing to complete, an initial appeal or pleading in an existing appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the above, we find that the appellant has failed to establish good cause for his untimely petition for review. The petition was 6 days late, the appellant was not proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and he has failed to show any circumstances beyond his control such as unavoidable casualty or misfortune that affected his ability to comply with the time limits. <span class="Italic">See Palermo</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 694, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-10 (dismissing a petition for review as untimely where the appellant's representative saved a draft petition in e-Appeal before it was due, but failed to submit it until it was 7 days late; e-Appeal had generated email warnings that the pleading was not complete and the representative had used e-Appeal to successfully file several pleadings in the underlying action, reflecting familiarity with the system); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981) (recognizing that an appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A PFR that was filed electronically was four minutes late. The Board excused the minimal delay. The appellant began the process of electronic filing before the deadline, but he did not complete all the steps needed for electronic filing until shortly after the deadline, <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 113 MSPR 443, 447 &#x00B6; 9, 2010 MSPB 56 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find good cause for the minimal filing delay based on the Board's event log showing this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's efforts to make a timely electronic filing, notwithstanding his failure to complete all of the steps necessary for electronic submission until 4 minutes after the deadline. <span class="Italic">See Livingston,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Rodgers,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9; <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Price,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 7 (2003) (the agency exercised due diligence and showed good cause for filing the petition for review 34 minutes late where its attorney began sending the petition via facsimile on the due date but had technical problems with her facsimile machine), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 398 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">cf. Miles v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 418, &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (finding that the appellant's 8-minute delay in responding to the agency's interrogatories was so insignificant that her submission was deemed timely made). Because we find good cause for the untimely filing and the agency has not alleged that it was prejudiced by the 4-minute filing delay, we find that waiver of the filing deadline is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Price,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Six minutes of delay were excused for an appellant who started the filing process electronically before the midnight deadline but asserted that she had some computer problems. <span class="Italic">Vega v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-11-0887-C-1 (NP 10/23/2014). Similarly, a PFR begun before, and concluded after, midnight was timely, <span class="Italic">Valle v. SSA,</span> NY-3330-15-0292-I-1 (NP 4/14/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant exercised due diligence and ordinary prudence under the circumstances by immediately refiling his petition after he realized that he had mistakenly filed a blank copy. According to the Board's e-Appeal logs, the appellant's representative logged into the e-Appeal system at 9:03 <span class="small">P.M</span>. on November 4, 2015, and started to submit the petition for review at 11:49 <span class="small">P.M</span>. Although this original pleading was blank, the e-Appeal logs show that the appellant's representative refiled the correct pleading less than half an hour later. Given the appellant's representative's attempts to file before the deadline and the minimal filing delay, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Price</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 7 (2003) (finding that the agency exercised due diligence and <span id="Page_1746"></span>showed good cause for filing a petition for review 34 minutes late where its attorney began sending the petition prior to the filing deadline but had technical problems), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 398 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The agency has not shown that it was prejudiced by the short delay, and, under the circumstances, we waive the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">But with no explanation from the appellant for the delay, a PFR filed 31/2 hours late on the electronic system was rejected as untimely. <span class="Italic">Gaetos v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 201, 2014 MSPB 39 (2014). An 81 minute delay was too much for the Board in <span class="Italic">King v. VA</span>, CH-0752-12-0039-C-1 (NP 6/16/2014), even though the appellant began electronically drafting his PFR shortly before the deadline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed his petition for review 81 minutes after the July 25, 2013 filing deadline set forth in the initial decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m). We find the appellant has not shown good cause for waiving the deadline for filing his petition for review. In the appellant's motion to waive the time limit, he states he began submitting his petition in the Board's e-Appeal system in the hour prior to the deadline, but the system was slow and led to his untimely filing. The date of filing for an electronic submission via the Board's e-Appeal system is the date of electronic submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's initial decision specifically informed the appellant that his petition for review had to be filed on or before July 25, 2013, or the initial decision would become final. The appellant delayed until the last possible moment to file his petition for review. Only under limited circumstances will the Board excuse delays in filing caused by difficulties encountered with the e-Appeal system. <span class="Italic">Palermo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 694, &#x00B6; 5 (2014). However, we do not find that the appellant's failure to submit his petition for review timely is excusable in this instance. According to the Board's e-Appeal logs, the appellant successfully logged into the system at 11:42 <span class="small">P.M</span>., and then again at 11:46 <span class="small">P.M</span>. on July 25, 2013, and he did not start his petition for review until 11:52 <span class="small">P.M</span>. or eight minutes prior to the filing deadline. When an appellant delays the filing of his petition for review until the eleventh hour, the appellant bears the risk that unforeseen circumstances could prevent the timely filing of his petition. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Justice</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 25, 27 (1989). The appellant's actions in this regard of waiting until eight minutes before the filing deadline to begin drafting his petition for review did not demonstrate the exercise of due diligence or ordinary prudence. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184). Under these circumstances, we find no good cause for a waiver of the Board's time limits for filing the petition for review in this case. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 670-74 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (the Board may grant or deny the waiver of a time limit for filing an appeal, in the interest of justice, after considering all the facts and circumstances of a particular case).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Belated filing was not excused because of inability to access e-filing in <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-16-0130-I-3 (NP 11/28/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under limited circumstances, the Board will excuse delays in filing caused by difficulties encountered with the Board's e-Appeal system. <span class="Italic">E.g., Salazar v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2010) (excusing a filing delay when the appellant alleged that he attempted to electronically file his petition for review on time and the e-Appeal system showed that he had, in fact, accessed the system prior to the date his petition was due; it was possible to exit the system without receiving a clear warning that he had not yet filed his pleading; and once he became aware that his petition had not been filed, he contacted the Board and submitted a petition for review that included an explanation of his untimeliness); <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 415, &#x00B6; 9 (2009) (excusing the untimely filing of an appeal when the appellant reasonably believed he filed timely by completing all the questions on the on-line appeal form and exited the website without receiving a clear warning that his appeal was not filed). However, we do not find that the appellant's failure to file timely is excusable in this instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's representative here claims that he "experienced heightened difficulty" in his ability to e-file in the minutes before midnight on the final date for filing, June 28, 2018, such that, "based upon exigency of the circumstances" and "given the time restriction afforded," he felt he had no other alternative but to submit the petition for review to the Board via email. In a different pleading, the appellant's representative states that, when he attempted to use e-Appeal minutes before the end of the filing period, "it was not situated where it could be assessed (sic)." The Board's e-Appeal logs do not show that the appellant's representative accessed e-Appeal on June 28, 2018. Notably, there were no e-Appeal site issues or system-wide outages recorded on June 28, 2018. Moreover, by his own admission, the filing "difficulty" the appellant's representative encountered was due to the fact that his personal computer "contained an excessive amount of photos, videos, emails and other files," causing a delay in populating and requiring him to purchase additional space "to accommodate the ever increasing data."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we find that the appellant has failed to establish good cause for his untimely petition for review. When an appellant delays the filing of his petition for review until the eleventh hour, he bears the risk that unforeseen circumstances could prevent the timely filing of his petition for review. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Department of Justice</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 25, 27 (1989). The actions of the appellant's representative in waiting until minutes before the filing deadline to submit his pleading does not demonstrate the exercise of due diligence or ordinary prudence, <span class="Italic">id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184), neither does his use of email, as he had been made aware that the Board does not accept pleadings by email. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(d). Notwithstanding, he waited more than 2 weeks after again being so notified to file his petition for review. Moreover, the appellant was not <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and, whatever the issues his representative experienced with his personal computer, he has failed to show any circumstances beyond his control such as unavoidable casualty or misfortune that affected his ability to comply with the time limits. <span class="Italic">See Palermo</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 694, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8, 10 (finding a petition for review untimely when the appellant and his representative were registered e-filers, should have realized from system notices that the petition had not been submitted, and failed to file the petition until 7 days after it was due); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981) (finding that the appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the agency electronically received a favorable initial decision and later learned it received the wrong decision, a PFR filing delay was excused.

<p class="Body-Text">If the Board's electronic repository contains an edition of the initial decision that is in the wrong format, the appellant is expected expeditiously to contact the Board to get a corrected copy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ortega v.

<p class="Body-Text">Many decisions emphasize the need for e-filers to monitor Board filings. Attentiveness was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Pelcher-Herring v. MSPB</span>, 612 Fed. Appx. 607, 610 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), affirming the Board's rejection of an untimely PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because Ms. Pelcher-Herring was a registered e-filer on July 2, the Board presumed that she received the decision when it issued on July 2. The Board also found that Ms. Pelcher-Herring offered no basis to substantiate her claims of receiving the decision six days after it was electronically issued. Consequently, the Board saw no basis for deviating from its presumption of receipt under &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)(2). We see no abuse of discretion in the Board's timing analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One must attend to one's email filters, <span class="Italic">Watty v. VA</span>, NY-0752-15-0177-I-1 (NP 10/14/2016):</p>

E-filers are responsible for ensuring that email from @mspb.gov is not blocked by filters, and for monitoring case activity at the Repository at e-Appeal Online to ensure that they have received all case-related documents. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(j)(2)-(3)....</p>
