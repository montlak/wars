<p class="Body-Text">Board appeal rights under 5 USC Chapter 75 do not apply to reductions in force, 5 USC 7512:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This subchapter applies to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;a removal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;a suspension for more than 14 days;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;a reduction in grade;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;a reduction in pay; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;a furlough of 30 days or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">but does not apply to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B) a reduction-in-force action under section 3502 of this title....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3502 places in OPM the authority to issue regulations applying to RIFs, and those regulations are at 5 CFR Part 351 (2022). A regulatory right to an MSPB appeal is provided by 5 CFR 351.901 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who has been furloughed for more than 30 days, separated, or demoted by a reduction in force action may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7121:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2) Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d) An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) [discrimination] of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first. Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1) Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. Similar matters which arise under other personnel systems applicable to employees covered by this chapter may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures, if any, applicable to those matters, or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise a matter either under the applicable appellate procedures or under the negotiated grievance procedure at such time as the employee timely files a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, whichever event occurs first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2) In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, an arbitrator shall be governed by section 7701(c)(1) of this title, as applicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A RIF is not a performance action, so it is not covered under 5 USC 4303. The RIF is excluded from coverage under 5 USC 7512. The only basis for the Board appeal of the RIF is the OPM regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result of indirect statutory analysis is that unless a contract grievance process excludes a RIF, the contract grievance process is the exclusive mechanism for challenging the RIF--unless the RIF is alleged to be discriminatory, and then an ordinary appeal may be taken to MSPB if no grievance is earlier filed; if a grievance alleging discrimination is filed and results in an arbitration award, the grievant may then seek review with MSPB through a request for review of that award.

<p class="Body-Text">The relation between a contract and 5 USC 7121 of a RIF case was explored in <span class="Italic">Bonner v. MSPB</span>, 781 F.2d 202 (Fed. Cir. 1986), a somewhat opaque opinion. The negotiated agreement provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Art. XI; Sec. 1 (Grievances)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Article provides a method for settlement of employee grievances. This procedure will be the only avenue available to employees for the processing and final disposition of grievances. The scope of this grievance procedure is only restricted as provided in Section 7121 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Art. XIII; Sec. 1 (RIF)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reduction-in-force as used herein is defined as the Employer's action to reduce the number of occupied positions within the unit requiring the use of reduction-in-force procedures set forth in applicable regulations to implement such actions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All reductions-in-force will be executed in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_407"></span>The court's analysis supported the Board's exclusion of the RIF appeal from its jurisdiction, 781 F.2d at 204-06:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal presents two questions for our review. The first question is whether this RIF action is a "matter" within the meaning of 5 USC 7121. The second question is whether this RIF action is excluded from the application of the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that this RIF action is a "matter" within the meaning of 5 USC 7121(a)(2). Just as the statute excludes from the negotiated grievance procedure the underlying action of "a suspension or removal under Section 7532," so the agreement may exclude from the negotiated grievance procedure the underlying action of a RIF. The significance of our holding is that if a collective bargaining agreement does exclude the underlying action of a RIF, then the RIF action is not a "matter" covered by a negotiated grievance procedure and the Board retains its customary appellate jurisdiction over an appeal from that RIF action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding whether the agreement here excluded RIFs from the negotiated grievance procedure, the Board applied an incorrect legal standard. The Board cited one of its own cases for the proposition that the collective bargaining agreement must "specifically" exclude a matter. <span class="Italic">Sirkin v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 16 MSPR 432, 436 (1983). That gloss is no part of the statute, its legislative history, or the regulation. The correct standard is the standard contained in the statute, whether the collective bargaining agreement excludes a matter from the application of the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...For the following reasons, we hold that upon applying the correct legal standard RIFs were not excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, regarding the course of dealing of the parties, there is evidence in the record indicating the agency's interpretation. By a form letter dated October 18, 1983, the agency notified Bonner of the RIF; that letter also contained information on the degree of some rights Bonner did or did not have [noting his right to file a grievance and not a Board appeal] .... The letter is consistent with the view that one of the contracting parties, the agency, understood the contract not to exclude a RIF from the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Bonner disputes the agency's interpretation of the agreement. She argues that the agency's interpretation of the agreement renders the RIF article, Article XIII, meaningless. If correct, that might be a strong argument in Bonner's favor. <span class="Italic">Cf. W.M. Schlosser Co. v. United States</span>, 767 F.2d 870, 874 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (rejecting an interpretation which renders contract language superfluous). However, we do not agree that it is correct. Initially, we note that the six sections of Article XIII grant to employees and to the union rights that are greater than the rights required by regulation. Further, even if Bonner's argument were understood to be restricted to the language of the first and second sections quoted above, we do not agree with it on the factual circumstances of this case. The first section refers to an <span class="Italic">employer's</span> action and the regulatory procedures for <span class="Italic">implementing</span> a RIF. Similarly, the second section requires strict compliance in <span class="Italic">executing</span> a RIF. It is possible that the contracting parties were addressing actions the employer must take and were not addressing the employee's choice of forum for resolving a dispute about those actions. In sum, we are not persuaded that Article XIII excludes a RIF from the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board interprets <span class="Italic">Bonner</span> to mean that the correct standard for determining whether an action was excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure and falls within Board appellate jurisdiction is whether the agreement excludes the matter from the application of the negotiated grievance procedure. Whether the agreement excludes a matter from the grievance procedure may be determined by examining the intent of the parties in drafting the agreement or their course of dealing. The contract that controls is the one in effect at the time the agency effects the RIF. <span class="Italic">Poirier v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 214, 216 n.2 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Farooq v. Corporation for National &#x0026; Community Service</span>, 109 MSPR 73, 77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 2008 MSPB 120 (2008), provides analysis of jurisdictional implications of a collective bargaining contract grievance process and the presence or absence of allegations of discrimination in a RIF appeal (also noting that the Board should liberally and realistically construe the appellant's submissions to determine if an allegation of discrimination was made as to the RIF):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who has been separated by a RIF action may appeal his separation to the Board. <span class="Italic">Riccio v. Department of the Navy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 6(2005); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901. Furthermore, an employee who retires after receiving a final notice that he will be separated by a RIF does not thereby lose his right to appeal the RIF action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j); <span class="Italic">Murray v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 20 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, where an employee is covered by a CBA that does not specifically exclude RIF actions, the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in the CBA are generally the exclusive procedures for resolving RIF actions that would otherwise be appealable to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a); <span class="Italic">Bonner v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 202, 204 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Di Sera v. Department of the Army</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 120, 122 (1996); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(c)(1)(ii). However, an aggrieved employee who alleges that he has been affected by discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) may elect to file an appeal with the Board concerning an action otherwise exclusively covered by the negotiated grievance procedures of the CBA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 288, 294 (1993); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(c)(1)(i). An employee's allegation of discrimination need not be nonfrivolous to entitle him to elect the Board procedure. <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of Defense</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Labor Relations Authority tried its hand at defining the line between Board and contract grievance jurisdiction over RIF cases, <span class="Italic">Federal Union of Scientists and Eng'rs, NAGE Local R1-144 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr.</span>, 25 FLRA 964, 966 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121(a) of the Statute provides that, except for those limited matters set out in section 7121(d) and (e), the negotiated grievance procedure shall be the exclusive procedure for resolving all matters which fall within its coverage. The limited exceptions to the exclusivity requirement, which are set out in section 7121(d) and (e), include claims that an employee has been affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) and matters covered under 5 USC 4303 and 7512. If these matters are also within the coverage of a negotiated grievance procedure, employees have a choice of raising the matter under either the negotiated procedure or the relevant statutory or appellate procedure, but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since 5 USC 4303 concerns performance-based actions and 5 USC 7512 expressly excludes RIF actions from its coverage, the only exception to the 7121(a) exclusivity requirement relevant to RIF actions is the one relating to prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 26 MSPR 447 (1985). Thus, where RIF actions are within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure, an aggrieved employee would be excepted from the exclusivity requirement of section 7121(a) only where an allegation was made that he or she had been affected by a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ambiguous contract coverage is not construed in favor of Board jurisdiction. One contract established broad grievance coverage, yet in another provision granted the employee the right to elect between the grievance procedure and a statutory appeals procedure if the complaint involved discrimination. The Board lacked jurisdiction over a RIF challenge based on an employee's complaint of discrimination in a promotion preceding the RIF. The appellant's theory was that if she had received the promotion, she would not have been subjected to a RIF. The Board decided, however, that if it is to have jurisdiction over a RIF appeal otherwise consigned to the negotiated grievance process, the jurisdictionally-controlling discriminatory event must directly relate to the appealed action. If there is no appellate jurisdiction over the denial of the promotion, there is no jurisdiction over the RIF. <span class="Italic">Cade v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 107, 109 &#x0026; n.2 (1984) ("Allegations in a RIF case...of prohibited discrimination concerning the classification of positions and the promotion (or nonpromotion) of employees within classification systems are not matters within the Board's appellate review authority." "Absent the Board's jurisdiction over appellant's nonpromotion, an allegation of discrimination relating to such nonpromotion does not confer jurisdiction on the Board."); <span class="Italic">see Nowak v. MSPB,</span> 182 Fed. Appx. 976, 977 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) ("The CBA involved here excludes certain types of disputes. RIF actions, however, are not listed among those specifically excluded. Accordingly, RIF actions...subject to this collective bargaining agreement must proceed under the alternative dispute resolution process set forth in the agreement; they may not be appealed to the Board."); <span class="Italic">Rider v. DOD</span>, 81 Fed. Appx. 305, 307 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (contract grievance procedure excluded adverse actions; since adverse actions do not include RIFs, the RIF was covered by the contractual grievance procedure and outside the jurisdiction of the MSPB); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Blackhat v. DHHS</span>, 117 MSPR 552, 556 n.5, 2012 MSPB 41 (2012) (RIF: indirectly addressing the impact of union representation: "The CBA at issue states that a grievance may be filed 'with or without [u]nion representation' and 'an employee may represent him/herself' in a grievance.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not construe a contract to create an illogical result. In <span class="Italic">Di Sera v. Dept. of Army</span>, 71 MSPR 120, 123 (1996), the key provision of the contract provided that "[a]dverse actions resulting from RIF's or transfers of function are not grievable or arbitrable under the Agreement." Because adverse actions do not result from RIFs and only rarely from transfers of functions, the Board concluded that the contract really intended to exclude from its coverage separations resulting from RIFs; otherwise, the Board reasoned, the contract language would be meaningless relative to other contract language concerning processing of disciplinary and adverse actions. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Greer v. DHUD</span>, 19 MSPR 90, 92 n.4 (1984) ("The agency contends that in the subject cases, the RIF's are not 'actions otherwise appealable to the Board' because they are expressly removed from Board jurisdiction by the collective bargaining agreement and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 (a). Thus the agency contends, absent an otherwise appealable action, an allegation of discrimination alone cannot confer jurisdiction on the Board [citing to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 (a) (1) (A) and (B)] . <span id="Page_408"></span>This circular argument would, if followed, render section 7121(d) completely meaningless when that section, by its plain language, provides that actions covered by collective bargaining agreements may be appealed to the board when coupled with an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a RIF challenge that would otherwise be covered through negotiated procedures, a whistleblowing claim permits the employee to pursue the case to the Board through an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Weslowski v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3168) (employee first addressed a claim to the OSC, then to the Board). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 10, "Jurisdictional Effect of Collective Bargaining Contract"</a> for the reduction in force process; refer to <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a> for the limited extent of an IRA appeal.]</p>
