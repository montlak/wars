<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-240"><span class="space">1.</span> Requested by OPM</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM has the statutory authority to seek judicial review of a Board decision. To preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> pending appeal, it may request the Board to stay its decision or order. An OPM stay request must be submitted with a request for reconsideration along with a supporting memorandum. Neither an AJ nor a regional director can act upon a stay request; that authority is entrusted only to the Board. <span class="Italic">Alfaro v. FAA</span>, 20 MSPR 127, 128 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board adjudicates an OPM stay application on bases similar to those of Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure: (1) it must be likely that the Board erred in its final order, i.e., there must be a likelihood of success on appeal; (2) there must be irreparable injury to the interested party without a stay; (3) other parties should not be substantially harmed by the stay; (4) the stay should promote or at least not adversely affect the public interest. Under the four-part stay analysis, if the last three factors strongly favor the issuance of the stay, the stay will be issued if a serious legal question exists as to the merits of the case. If support for a stay from the last three factors is slight, however, a stay will be issued only if the possibility for success on appeal is strong. <span class="Italic">Berard v. OPM</span>, 24 MSPR 347, 349 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 698, 700 (1995) ("OPM's speculative arguments fail to meet the requirement that a party claiming harm to itself or others must show that the harm is substantial and certain and must offer proof that the harm will occur."); <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 239, 245-46 (1995) (insufficient for OPM to argue, instead of demonstrating, the possibility of harm to other interested parties when it was not apparent how those parties could be harmed without a stay); <span class="Italic">Andrzjewski v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 26 MSPR 506, 507-09 (1985) (point-by-point analysis of an OPM application for a stay pending judicial review in the Federal Circuit of a Board decision that OPM's emergency furlough regulation was invalid); <span class="Italic">Cofield v. GPO</span>, 26 MSPR 261, 264 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">WMATC v. Holiday Tours, Inc.</span>, 559 F.2d 841, 843-44 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). If OPM does not address the four factors in its request for a stay, the request will be denied. <span class="Italic">Jeffrey v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 434 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dean v. USDA</span>, 101 MSPR 347, 349 &#x00B6; 3, 2006 MSPB 54 (2006) ("In its stay request, OPM did not articulate an argument for granting its stay request in terms of these four criteria. Rather, it merely expressed its beliefs that the Board's orders are in conflict with the <span class="Italic">Luevano</span> consent decree and that they have "highly complex and far reaching implications." No argument was presented to show harm to OPM or the parties, nor was any attempt made to demonstrate the public interest in a stay. In the absence of such a showing, the only possible basis for a stay is an argument reflecting a strong likelihood that OPM's petition will be successful. However, OPM did not present such an argument with its stay request.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speculative assertions concerning harm to OPM, and the possibility of litigation in multiple forums with the potential for conflicting decisions, do not justify a stay. <span class="Italic">Riddick v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 581, 584-85 (1985) (also considering the effect of a stay upon the appellant's ability to secure a speedy hearing on the merits of her case before the Board). The Board rejected an OPM stay application as based on speculative concerns, <span class="Italic">Rogers v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 626, 628-29 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may exercise its discretion to stay the enforcement of a final decision pending judicial review or reconsideration. In determining whether to grant a stay, we evaluate four criteria: (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he or she is likely to prevail on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) whether the issuance of the stay will substantially harm the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. The Board balances the likelihood of success on appeal or reconsideration with the last three criteria. If the stay applicant convincingly argues that the last three criteria are met, we will issue a stay if a serious legal question exists on the merits. If support for a stay based on the last three criteria is slight, however, we will grant a stay only if the possibility for success on appeal or reconsideration is strong. The Board will not address the first criterion if the applicant fails to demonstrate any support for a stay based on the last three criteria. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 73 MSPR 174, 175-76 (1997); <span class="Italic">Andrada v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 73 MSPR 117, 119 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the third criterion, OPM argues that the appellant will not suffer irreparable injury because he will be able to receive a disability annuity, presumably computed under the regular disability retirement annuity provisions, during the pendency of these proceedings, and that, even if the appellant is deprived of an annuity, "such deprivation would be only temporary." With respect to the second and fourth criteria, OPM argues that a stay is necessary to protect it from paying excess monies from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) if the Board's <span id="Page_1813"></span>decision is reversed. It contends that it will be faced with "hundreds, if not thousands" of requests for adjustments of disability retirement annuities. OPM asserts that, if the Board's decision is reversed, it will be required to undergo proceedings in each case to recover the overpaid annuities and that it may not be able to recover all overpayments if the Board waives recovery of the overpayments. Thus, OPM argues, the Fund will be subject to possible overpayments that likely would be unrecoverable. It also asserts that granting the stay will ensure efficiency in litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's unsupported assertion that a stay is necessary to protect it from paying excess monies from the Fund and to protect the Board from unnecessary litigation, if the Board's decision is reversed, does not warrant granting its stay request. Speculative argument of harm is insufficient to meet the stay criteria. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Office Of Personnel Management</span>, 70 MSPR 448, 449-50 (1996); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Caponio v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 73 MSPR 243, 246 (1997). Moreover, OPM's unsupported assertion that it may not be able to recoup any overpayment, if the Board's decision is reversed, does not warrant granting its stay request. <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability,</span> 68 MSPR 296, 301 (1995). Thus, we must deny OPM's stay request regardless of whether OPM has satisfied the first criterion by showing that there is a strong possibility of success on reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sawyer,</span> 73 MSPR at 176.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, to support its assertion concerning the first criterion, OPM has simply reasserted the arguments it previously presented in this appeal, and submitted an initial decision, issued after the January 6, 1998 Opinion and Order, that supports its position. OPM's presentation of its previous arguments does not show that there is a strong possibility of success on reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See Briggs,</span> 68 MSPR at 299-300. Moreover, it is well settled that initial decisions are not precedential....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adkins v. OPM</span>, 104 MSPR 206, 207-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-8, 2006 MSPB 348 (2006), also denied an OPM stay request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on the request of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to stay enforcement of the Board's final decision in <span class="Italic">Adkins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 242 (2006), during the pendency of the Director of OPM's request for reconsideration of that decision. The Board held in Adkins that the appellant, who retired on disability, was entitled to an enhanced firefighter annuity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8452(d) and 8415(d) and ordered OPM to recompute the appellant's disability annuity. OPM contends that the Board lacked jurisdiction to issue a decision concerning the computation of the appellant's Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) disability annuity and, assuming jurisdiction exists, the Board's analysis was erroneous. For the reasons set forth below, OPM's request for a stay is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may exercise its discretion to stay the enforcement of a final decision pending judicial review or reconsideration by the Board. <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 299 (1995). In determining whether to grant a stay, the Board considers four factors: (1) Whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he will prevail on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed absent the stay; (3) whether the other interested parties will be harmed by the stay; and (4) where the public interest lies. <span class="Italic">Sangenito v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (2000). Where the stay applicant convincingly argues that the last three factors weigh in favor of a stay, ordinarily a stay will be issued if a serious legal question exists on the merits. If support for a stay based on the last three factors is slight, however, a stay will be granted only if the possibility for success on reconsideration is strong. <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 299.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that it will be irreparably harmed if a stay is not granted because, if the Board's decision is reversed, OPM will have to undergo extensive administrative procedures to recover the erroneous payments made and, in some instances, may be unable to recover those payments. OPM argues further that the interests of other individuals who are paid enhanced disability annuities will be harmed because, if the Board's decision is reversed, they will have to repay the retirement fund and may be unable to do so. Finally, OPM argues that it is in the public interest to stay the Board's decision so that the Federal Treasury does not pay annuities in excess of those authorized by law and that OPM does not spend its limited appropriations for the adjudication of annuity claims and the recovery of the payments made contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's arguments are speculative and fail to meet the requirement that a party claiming harm to itself or others must show that the harm is not only substantial but that the harm will occur. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 698, 700 (1995). Indeed, OPM's basic argument focusing on the difficulty of recoupment is one the Board has rejected on several occasions. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Caponio v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 243, 246 (1997); <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 301; <span class="Italic">Berard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 347, 349 n.2 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that OPM's arguments can be read as offering even slight support for a stay, it must show that the possibility of success on the merits is strong. <span class="Italic">Caponio</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 246. OPM's arguments on the merits do not meet that high standard. OPM's first argument, that the Board lacked jurisdiction to find that the appellant's disability retirement annuity must be recalculated, is based on its view that the appellant never presented to OPM the precise issue of whether a disabled FERS annuitant is entitled to an enhancement of his annuity based on his former service as a firefighter. OPM is correct that the Board ordinarily lacks jurisdiction to consider an issue not addressed by OPM in a reconsideration decision on a retirement issue. <span class="Italic">See Mulroy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 8 (2002). OPM, however, relies on an overly narrow interpretation of the issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, "requested that his disability annuity be supplemented or changed to an enhanced firefighter annuity." <span class="Italic">Adkins</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 3. He was consistent in his request that his service as a firefighter be considered to provide him with an enhanced annuity. <span class="Italic">See Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4. That the appellant requested a change of his annuity from a FERS disability annuity to an enhanced annuity under the immediate retirement provisions of FERS rather than requesting a recalculation of his disability annuity to reflect his firefighter status does not, in our view, provide a strong basis for defeating the Board's jurisdiction in this case. OPM was on notice of the appellant's desire for an enhanced annuity based on his service as a firefighter. Thus it was OPM's responsibility to review its determination of the appellant's disability annuity and determine whether, consistent with FERS, the appellant was entitled to an enhanced disability annuity. OPM's failure to address the appellant's claim properly does not mean that the Board, on review, cannot do so. <span class="Italic">See Licausi v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 350 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (the Board reviews decisions of OPM concerning retirement benefits <span class="Italic">de novo</span> and therefore is not confined to either upholding OPM's decision on the ground invoked by OPM or remanding to OPM for further proceedings); <span class="Italic">cf. O'Neill v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (Board had jurisdiction to consider whether OPM correctly calculated the appellant's annuity where, despite the appellant's repeated requests, OPM failed to address that issue in its reconsideration decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decisions cited by OPM do not require a different result. In <span class="Italic">McNeese v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 70 (1994), the Board held that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of OPM's initial decision, finding that OPM's delay in issuing a reconsideration decision did not, under the circumstances of the case, constitute a refusal to issue a reconsideration decision that would permit the Board to treat the initial decision as final for purposes of a Board appeal. In <span class="Italic">Reed v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 290 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 837 F.2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table), the Board declined to address the appellant's claim, raised for the first time before the Board on petition for review, that the agency had materially altered the settlement agreement and that the agency used an incorrect retirement date where the only issue before OPM was the exclusion of a back pay award from the calculation of the appellant's retirement annuity. Finally in <span class="Italic">Autrey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 130 (1985), the Board found that the only issue presented to and decided by OPM was the issue of credit, for purposes of calculating an annuity, for the appellant's military service, and therefore the Board lacked jurisdiction to address the appellant's claim of entitlement to credit for civilian service. As demonstrated, none of the cases cited pertain to a situation where an appellant, albeit inartfully, raises a claim to OPM that OPM fails to address. Thus, OPM's arguments fail to demonstrate a high likelihood of success on the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's second argument, that the Board erroneously found the appellant entitled to an enhanced firefighter annuity, goes to the heart of this case. OPM argues that there are material differences between the statutory provisions governing computation of FERS disability annuities and the provisions relating to computation of Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) disability annuities that were considered by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Pitsker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 234 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The Board's decision recognized the differences in structure and wording of the CSRS and FERS statutes, however, and despite those differences, found that the applicable provisions of FERS operate like the CSRS statutes with respect to disability annuities for individuals with creditable firefighter service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adkins</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 10. Although OPM contends that the Board erred in concluding that the computation formula at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8452(d)(1) supersedes the flat computation formula in section 8452(a) for FERS disability annuitants, addressing OPM's argument and resolving this problem of statutory construction will require a detailed analysis of the relevant provisions and, perhaps, their legislative history. At this point OPM has not raised such strong doubts in our minds over the correctness of our previous analysis that we could conclude that it has a strong possibility for success on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rogers</span> and <span class="Italic">Adkins</span> were summarized in <span class="Italic">Blaha v. OPM</span>, 106 MSPR 494, 496-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8, 2007 MSPB 218 (2007), involving an annuity determination--based on settled precedent--that OPM sought to stay pending resolution of a reconsideration petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1814"></span>Whether to grant a stay pending reconsideration of a Board decision is a matter within the Board's discretion. In exercising that discretion, the Board is guided by four factors: (1) Whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he or she is likely to prevail on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) whether the issuance of a stay will substantially harm the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. <span class="Italic">See Adkins v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 2 (2006); <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 626, 628 (1998). In general, a stay will be granted if the last three factors are "convincingly argue[d]" and if a "serious legal question" exists on the merits. <span class="Italic">Adkins,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 2; <span class="Italic">Rogers,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. at 628. However, whether to grant a stay in any particular case requires an "individualized judgment," and the factors above "cannot be reduced to a set of rigid rules." <span class="Italic">Donati v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 4 (2006), citing <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6; 5 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we need not address whether a "serious legal question" exists on the merits because OPM has not "convincingly argued" that it would suffer irreparable harm if a stay was not granted. Nor need we address whether the possibility for success on the merits is strong because OPM's support for a stay based on the last three factors is not even slight. <span class="Italic">See Adkins,</span> 104 MSPR 206, &#x00B6; 2. OPM argues that if the Board denies its stay request, OPM would be required to pay survivor annuities where the individual seeking to provide benefits for another person upon his or her death presents evidence that he or she did not meet the election deadline because of misinformation from a government employee. According to OPM, if the Board's decision is ultimately reversed, it would be required to recover the annuity payments made contrary to law and some individuals would lack the financial ability to make the repayment and would be entitled to waiver of collection. OPM also contends that it would face extensive administrative and judicial procedures in attempting to recover the erroneous payments and that the congressionally appropriated funds for administration of the federal retirement systems would be affected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's arguments of harm are based on future potential payments and expenditures that would have to be made only if a federal annuitant attempts to make a belated election of survivor benefits, shows that he or she is entitled to estoppel against OPM because of misinformation, and then dies leaving a survivor entitled to benefits. OPM provides no information regarding how many individuals claim that they failed to make an election because of misinformation and how many of those individuals die leaving a survivor who would be entitled to benefits if a belated election was accepted. Moreover, for OPM's purported harm to manifest itself, the series of events set forth above necessary to create an erroneous payment or expenditure should the Board reverse its prior decision would have to occur in the relatively brief period of time that it will take for the Board to rule on the Director's Reconsideration Request. OPM's claims of potential harm are both attenuated and imprecise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's arguments are also speculative and fail to meet the requirement that a party claiming harm to itself or others must show that the harm is not only substantial but that the harm will occur. <span class="Italic">Adkins,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 698, 700 (1995). Furthermore, OPM's argument focusing on the difficulty of recoupment of a potential overpayment is one the Board has previously rejected. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Adkins,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 301 (1995); <span class="Italic">Berard v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 24 M.S.P.R. 347, 349 n.2 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, OPM has failed to show that it would be irreparably harmed absent a stay. In addition, OPM has not presented any arguments addressing whether the appellant would be substantially harmed if a stay was granted. Thus, OPM has failed to meet its burden of showing an entitlement to a stay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board was somewhat expansive in its definition of irreparable harm to the retirement system in <span class="Italic">Donati v. OPM,</span> 104 MSPR 658, 659-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8, 2007 MSPB 44 (2007), granting a stay pending resolution of an OPM reconsideration petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant petitioned a New Hampshire court "To Grant Common Law Wife Status," based on her relationship to federal employee Andre Gabert in the time leading up to his death in 2003. The court granted the petition under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#x00A7; 457:39, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Persons cohabiting and acknowledging each other as husband and wife, and generally reputed to be such, for the period of 3 years, and until the decease of one of them, shall thereafter be deemed to have been legally married.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied the appellant's subsequent application for survivor benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b), which provides for payments to "a widow or widower" of an employee who "dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service" under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). For purposes of section 8442, "widow" means "the surviving wife of an employee...who...was married to him for at least 9 months immediately before his death." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8441(1). On appeal, a majority of the Board reversed OPM's decision and awarded benefits to the appellant. Vice Chairman Rose dissented. <span class="Italic">Donati v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 30 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has petitioned the Board for reconsideration of its decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d). OPM also requests a stay of the Board's decision pending resolution of its petition for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether to grant a stay pending reconsideration of a Board decision is a matter within the Board's discretion. In exercising that discretion, the Board has been guided by four factors: (1) Whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he or she is likely to prevail on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) whether the issuance of a stay will substantially harm the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. <span class="Italic">See Rogers v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 626, 628 (1998). If the party requesting a stay presents a "serious legal argument" on the merits and the last three factors are "convincingly argued," generally a stay should be granted. <span class="Italic">Sangenito v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6; 5 (2000). However, whether to grant a stay in any particular case requires an "individualized judgment," and the factors above "cannot be reduced to a set of rigid rules." <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6; 5 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the first factor, OPM argues that nothing in the language of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#x00A7; 457:39 states that the deemed marital status created upon the death of one of the parties extends <span class="Italic">retroactively</span> for 3 years prior to the date of death. OPM argues that instead, the statute merely provides that, as a requirement of posthumous recognition of a "deemed" marriage, the parties had to have cohabited and met the other statutory criteria for at least 3 years. OPM thus questions the conclusion in the earlier Board decision that the appellant "was married to [Mr. Gabert] for at least 9 months immediately before his death," which is a condition for receipt of benefits in the relevant federal statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8441(1). OPM further argues that decisions of the New Hampshire Supreme Court indicate that N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. &#x00A7; 457:39 should be interpreted narrowly. It also argues that New Hampshire law distinguishes between posthumous proof of existence of a marriage based on cohabitation, acknowledgment, and reputation on the one hand, and proof of a "marriage in fact" for a particular duration on the other; according to OPM, although a New Hampshire court found that the former situation was present in the appellant's case, it is the latter situation that is relevant for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442. While in this stay proceeding we do not express agreement or disagreement with OPM's contentions, we find that OPM has presented a "serious legal argument" on the merits weighing in favor of granting a stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the second factor, whether OPM will be irreparably harmed absent a stay, the Board has held that the possibility that OPM may be unable to recoup monies paid from the Civil Service Retirement Fund by itself generally does not support the granting of a stay. <span class="Italic">See Rose v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 490, &#x00B6; 3 (2000). Nevertheless, OPM has alleged irreparable harm beyond the possibility that OPM may be unable to recoup such monies. OPM contends that the amount of money that OPM can expend for administrative expenses relating to FERS and the Civil Service Retirement System is subject to annual limitations imposed by Congress, and that "if OPM is required to divert resources to adjudicating FERS spousal survivor benefits applications and paying spousal survivor benefits to individuals not legally entitled to receive such benefits, and then to divert resources to recover the amounts of the illegally paid enhanced annuities, that results in the effective 'loss' of limited appropriated funds," which constitutes irreparable harm. There is no indication that OPM's expenditure of additional resources under the above scenario is amenable to recoupment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the third stay factor, it is not clear that the harm to the appellant and any similarly-situated individuals resulting from a stay would be "substantial." Admittedly a stay will delay the appellant's receipt of the benefits that she was awarded, but we do not envision a protracted delay before we rule on the merits of OPM's petition for reconsideration. Moreover, even if we denied OPM's request for a stay, the appellant would be well-advised to set aside any benefits she did receive in case the Board overruled its earlier decision on reconsideration and found that she was not entitled to survivor benefits after all. In other words, the very fact that OPM seeks reconsideration of the Board's decision is a detriment to the appellant that the Board is in no position to ameliorate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as to the fourth factor, the public interest lies on the side of OPM. Payments from the public fisc should not be spent unnecessarily or based on a legal rule that could be overturned within a very short time. OPM asserts that there are at least four other survivor benefit claims that may be affected by the Board's decision on the merits of this case. It would appear to be an easier, faster, and less costly process for OPM to award the survivor benefits at issue only if the Board's decision is ultimately affirmed in the near future, than for OPM to make payments now with <span id="Page_1815"></span>the possibility that it will later have to try to recover overpayments if the Board's decision is reversed at either the Board or the Federal Circuit level. Such overpayment determinations could lead to a host of Board appeals that would, in turn, lead to the expenditure of additional government resources.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That an employee might receive a salary on the basis of a Board reinstatement order that could later be overturned by the courts is not irreparable harm to the government. Recoupment procedures are available. <span class="Italic">Parton v. FCC</span>, 9 MSPR 638, 640, 9 MSPB 258 (1982) (OPM stay request). The possibility that OPM's retirement fund will lose interest on an improperly ordered payment of benefits is not irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">Berard</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Andrada v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 117, 120 (1997) ("[S]peculative, unsupported arguments regarding an allegedly large overpayment fail to meet the requirement that a party claiming harm to itself or others must show that the harm is substantial and certain and must offer proof that the harm will occur.");<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Sangenito v. OPM</span>, 85 MSPR 211, 214 &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (rejecting the possible inability of OPM to recover overpayment as the basis for a stay; Sangenito would have been deprived of any annuity); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 448, 449-50 (1996) (rejecting an argument by OPM that a stay pending judicial review was necessary to protect OPM from paying excess monies from a retirement fund and to protect the former employing agency from unnecessary administrative procedures and litigation if the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's position concerning the application of statutory administrative offset procedures to the reallocation of retirement deductions toward repayment of social security taxes); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Caponio v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 73 MSPR 243, 246 (1997) (OPM's stay motion would not be granted based on arguments of administrative burden of collecting retroactive deposits to retirement accounts); <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 174, 176 (1997) ("The mere assertion that a stay would relieve OPM of the task of preparing documents to comply with the Board's final order is one which provides absolutely no support for any of the...criteria for granting a stay.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When adjudicating an OPM stay request, the Board considers the impact of a stay on the appellant, <span class="Italic">Cofield v. GPO</span>, 26 MSPR 261, 266 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's argument that the issuance of a stay would not harm appellant is also without merit. Appellant filed a petition for enforcement because he viewed the position to which he was detailed and eventually transferred as less desirable than the one from which he was wrongfully removed. Certainly for a career policeman to be stripped of his weapon and assigned as a security guard signifies a loss in prestige and experience, if not in grade or pay. While this injury may not be irreparable, it clearly constitutes a substantial setback to appellant's career.</p>
