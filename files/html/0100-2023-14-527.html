<p class="noindent">Not to be forgotten in the list of conditions of employment that may be negotiated is provision of bottled water. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 1748</span>, 38 FLRA 899, 912-13 (1990) (ULP for management to discontinue availability of bottled water that became established for bargaining unit employees through past practice); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Employment Standards Admin. and AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 948</span>, 37 FLRA 25 (1990) (lengthy explanation in context of ULP case of why provision of potable water for employees was employment condition).</p>
<p class="noindent">The ability to negotiate for, or continue the past practice of, provision of workplace bottled water provoked considerable discussion of the Antideficiency Act in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. and NAGE Local R1-134</span>, 64 FLRA 1136, 1139 (2010) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 665 F.3d 1339 (D.C. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determining that the statute did not bar the underlying expenditure of funds:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DOL I</span> and <span class="Italic">DOL II,</span> the Authority determined that the availability of potable water is a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">DOL II</span>, 38 FLRA at 908; <span class="Italic">DOL I</span>, 37 FLRA at 34. The Authority has recognized that conditions of employment may be established for bargaining-unit employees either by practice or agreement. 38 FLRA at 908. Here, the parties do not dispute that the Agency's provision of bottled water for many years was an established past practice. Thus, the provision of bottled water is a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency may not change the condition of employment without fulfilling its bargaining obligations.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DOL II,</span> 38 FLRA at 910. In this regard, the agency is obligated to negotiate over such a change unless it is precluded from doing so by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">DOL I,</span> 37 FLRA at 36.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that purchasing bottled water would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act and the Purpose Statute. The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1341, precludes an agency from expending funds: (1) in excess of those appropriated for the fiscal year in which the expenditure is made; and (2) prior to their appropriation. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1341(a)(1)(A) and (B); <span class="Italic">Office of the Adjutant Gen., Mo. Nat'l Guard, Jefferson City, Mo.,</span> 58 FLRA 418, 420 (2003).[9] The Purpose Statute, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301, prohibits the use of funds for purposes other than those for which the funds were appropriated "unless as otherwise provided by law." [10] <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1647,</span> 59 FLRA 369, 371 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1341 provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(a)&#x2003;(1) An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia government may not--</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(A) make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation or fund for the expenditure or obligation; [or]</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(B) involve either government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301 provides, in pertinent part: "(a) Appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Comptroller Gen.&#x2003;McCarl to Maj. Gen. Anton Stephan, D.C. Militia, 6 Comp. Gen. 619 (March 25, 1927), the Comptroller General set forth a "necessary expense" rule to be applied when determining whether an expense is necessary for the expenditure of appropriated funds. <span class="Italic">See DOL I</span>, 37 FLRA at 34-35. The Comptroller General, in interpreting this rule, has stated that an agency has "reasonable discretion" to determine how to carry out the object of an appropriation, and that this determination is to be made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> Principles of Fed. Appropriations Law, 4-20-4-21 (2004 Ed.). Regarding the use of appropriations for bottled water, the Comptroller General has stated "no objection" so long as the agency "administratively determines" that this is the best way to provide potable water. Decision <span class="Italic">Matter of: Dep't of the Army-Use of Appropriations for Bottled Water,</span> B-310502, (February 4, 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">None of the Comptroller General decisions, including those cited by the Agency, permits unilateral termination of a practice to provide bottled water. The Authority recognized this principle in <span class="Italic">DOL I</span>, where it held that the "necessary expense" rule does not require "that an agency make its determination [of necessity] unilaterally or without the benefit of negotiations with the exclusive representative of the employees affected by the change." <span class="Italic">DOL I,</span> 37 FLRA at 35-36. In this connection, the Authority held that nothing in the federal fiscal laws or Comptroller General decisions prohibits agencies from exercising through negotiation the discretion they possess to "determine whether there is sufficient evidence of the necessity to purchase [water] from the Government's standpoint." <span class="Italic">Id. See also DOL II,</span> 38 FLRA at 912 (bargaining over the continuation of the practice of providing bottled water was not inconsistent with federal law or Comptroller General decisions). As the Authority has held, "insofar as an agency has discretion regarding a matter affecting conditions of employment it is obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through negotiation unless precluded by regulatory or statutory provisions." <span class="Italic">DOL I,</span> 37 FLRA at 36 (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 21 FLRA 6, 10 (1986)).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 665 F.3d 1339, 1346-51 (D.C. Cir. 2012), the court concluded that appropriations statutes prohibited expenditures for bottled water:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Appropriations Clause of the Constitution provides: "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...." U.S. CONST. art. I, &#x00A7; 9, cl. 7. The Clause's words convey a "straightforward and explicit command": No money "can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress." <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Mgmt. v. Richmond (OPM)</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990) (quoting <span class="Italic">Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States</span>, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Clause protects Congress's "exclusive power over the federal purse." <span class="Italic">Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. EPA</span>, 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The power over the purse was one of the most important authorities allocated to Congress in the Constitution's "necessary partition of power among the several departments." THE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 320 (James Madison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961); <span class="Italic">see also id. </span>NO. 58, at 359 (James Madison) ("This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Appropriations Clause is thus a bulwark of the Constitution's separation of powers among the three branches of the National Government. It is particularly important as a restraint on Executive Branch officers: If not for the Appropriations Clause, "the executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation; and might apply all its monied resources at his pleasure." 3 JOSEPH STORY, <span id="page_1014"></span>COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES &#x00A7; 1342, at 213-14 (1833); <span class="Italic">see also Cincinnati Soap Co.</span>, 301 U.S. at 321 (the Clause "was intended as a restriction upon the disbursing authority of the Executive department"); <span class="Italic">Reeside v. Walker</span>, 52 U.S. 272, 291 (1851) ("However much money may be in the Treasury at any one time, not a dollar of it can be used in the payment of any thing not thus previously sanctioned. Any other course would give to the fiscal officers a most dangerous discretion."). The Appropriations Clause prevents Executive Branch officers from even inadvertently obligating the Government to pay money without statutory authority. <span class="Italic">See OPM</span>, 496 U.S. at 416; <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 648 F.3d 841, 845 (D.C. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal statutes reinforce Congress's control over appropriated funds. <span class="Italic">See </span>31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301 <span class="Italic">et seq.; see also Harrington v. Bush</span>, 553 F.2d 190, 194-95 (D.C. Cir. 1977) ("This clause is not self-defining and Congress has plenary power to give meaning to the provision. The Congressionally chosen method of implementing the requirements of Article I, section 9, clause 7 is to be found in various statutory provisions.") (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1301, known as the "Purpose Statute," provides that appropriated funds may be applied only "to the objects for which the appropriations were made." 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a). Section 1341, known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, makes it unlawful for government officials to "make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation" or to involve the Federal Government "in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law." 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1341(a)(1)(A)-(B). A government official who knowingly and willfully violates Section 1341(a) is subject to criminal penalties, including imprisonment. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1350.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal collective bargaining is not exempt from the rule that funds from the Treasury may not be expended except pursuant to congressional appropriations.&#x2003;Indeed, the statute governing federal labor relations explicitly relieves agencies of the duty to bargain over any matter that would be "inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1). Therefore, under Section 7117, "a collective bargaining proposal is contrary to law, and hence not subject to bargaining, if it requires expenditure of appropriated funds for a purpose not authorized by law." <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 648 F.3d at 848 (quoting <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, P.R. Army Chapter v. FLRA (ACT III)</span>, 534 F.3d 772, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2008)); <span class="Italic">see also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, P.R. Army Chapter v. FLRA (ACT II)</span>, 370 F.3d 1214, 1217 (D.C. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress's control over federal expenditures is "absolute." <span class="Italic">Rochester</span>, 960 F.2d at 185 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Clause does not permit an agency, by contract with a union, "to authorize the expenditure of funds beyond what Congress has approved." <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 648 F.3d at 845; <span class="Italic">see also Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, P.R. Army Chapter v. FLRA (ACT I)</span>, 269 F.3d 1112, 1116 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">The question, then, is whether providing bottled water under these circumstances would violate federal appropriations law. If it would, then the Navy cannot continue providing bottled water at the Newport facilities and cannot bargain over that issue with the unions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have established so far that an agency's obligations under federal collective bargaining law are circumscribed by the limitations imposed by federal appropriations law. Therefore, whether the Navy had a duty to bargain depends on whether federal appropriations law permits the purchase of bottled water where safe and drinkable tap water is available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority ruled that using appropriated funds to purchase bottled water at the Newport facilities would not contravene federal appropriations law.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. Div. Newport, R.I.,</span> 64 F.L.R.A. 1136, 1139-40 (2010).

<p class="noindent-1">A core tenet of appropriations law is enshrined in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a), the "Purpose Statute," which commands: "Appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law." Under Section 1301(a), in order for appropriated funds to be legally available for an expenditure, "the purpose of the obligation or expenditure must be authorized." 1 GAO, PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW at 4-6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin with, the relevant appropriations statute does not specifically prohibit the purchase of bottled water. But by the same token, no statutory language explicitly <span class="Italic">authorizes </span>the purchase of bottled water here. And all uses of appropriated funds must be affirmatively approved by Congress; the mere absence of a prohibition is not sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question then is whether, and under what circumstances, a general appropriation for an agency's operations implicitly authorizes the purchase of bottled water.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Comptroller General has developed the "necessary expense" doctrine as a rule of construction for appropriations statutes.[4] That doctrine governs the many situations where, as here, general statutory text leaves open whether a specific proposed expenditure is a legally authorized purpose for which appropriated funds may be expended. <span class="Italic">See ACT II</span>, 370 F.3d at 1221-22. This Court regards "the assessment of the GAO and thus, the Comptroller General as an expert opinion, which we should prudently consider but to which we have no obligation to defer." <span class="Italic">ACT I</span>, 269 F.3d at 1116 (quoting <span class="Italic">Delta Data Systems Corp. v.

<p class="noindent-1">Under the necessary expense doctrine, "[a]n appropriation made for a specific object is available for expenses necessarily incident to accomplishing that object unless prohibited by law or otherwise provided for." 1 GAO, PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW at 4-20; <span class="Italic">see also ACT II</span>, 370 F.3d at 1218; <span class="Italic">Public Building Improvements</span>, 42 Comp. Gen. 226, 228 (1962). Whether an expenditure is reasonably necessary to accomplish the agency's mission, "in the first instance, is a matter of agency discretion," but the expenditure's "relationship to an authorized purpose or function" may be "so attenuated as to take it beyond that range" of permissible discretion. <span class="Italic">Implementation of Army Safety Program</span>, B-223608 (Comp. Gen. Dec. 19, 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Comptroller General "has never established a precise formula for determining the application of the necessary expense rule"; rather, it applies and develops the doctrine through its "body of case law responsive to the changing needs of government." 1 GAO, PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW at 4-21. That case law distinguishes necessary expenses, on which appropriated funds may be expended, from "personal expenses," on which they may not be expended. <span class="Italic">See Scope of Professional Credentials Statute</span>, B-302548, at 3 (Comp. Gen. Aug. 20, 2004) ("Generally, personal expenses are not payable from appropriated funds absent specific statutory authority."). Personal expenses are items that government employees are expected to obtain at their own expense, like food while at their regular workplaces (that is, not on government travel). <span class="Italic">See </span>GAO, 1 PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW at 4-103 ("food is a personal expense and government salaries are presumed adequate to enable employees to eat regularly").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Comptroller General's case law has analyzed when agencies may purchase bottled water under the necessary expense doctrine. As a threshold matter, "it has long been conceded that drinking water is a necessity" at the workplace. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 4-119 n.70. "However, an agency may not use appropriated funds for <span class="Italic">bottled </span>drinking water for the use of employees where the public water supply of the locality is safe for drinking purposes." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(emphasis added). That is because, "[a]s a general proposition, bottled water is a personal expense for which appropriations are not available." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, Military Surface Deployment &#x0026; Distribution Command--Use of Appropriations for Bottled Water,</span> B-318588, at 1 (Comp.

<p class="noindent-1">Bottled water is considered "necessary"--and thus may be purchased with appropriated funds--when "the available water posed a health risk if consumed, or because water was not available." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 2-3. The line of Comptroller General decisions articulating this rule dates back at least to 1923. <span class="Italic">See Purchase of Drinking Water</span>, 2 Comp. Gen. 776, 776 (1923) <span id="page_1015"></span>("The purchase of drinking water is, ordinarily, a personal matter, and the expense may only be allowed upon the ground of necessity. It has been recognized as a duty upon the Government to supply drinking water where none is available in the offices or other public quarters or where that furnished is unwholesome or not potable."); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Dep't of the Army--Use of Appropriations for Bottled Water</span>, B-310502, at 3 (Comp.

<p class="noindent-1">Under the Comptroller General's longstanding reading of the statute, an agency would violate 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301 if it provided bottled water when safe and drinkable tap water is available. The Navy--represented by the Department of Justice--concurs in that reasoning and conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with that interpretation of the statute.&#x2003;Permitting bottled water purchases only upon a showing of such necessity recognizes that "an agency, as an employer, is expected to meet certain basic needs of its employees, particularly when it comes to protecting an employee's health and safety in the workplace." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army--Use of Appropriations for Bottled Water</span>, B-310502, at 4. That rule balances that appropriate solicitude for employee health with the principle that food, including "snacks and refreshments," "is a personal expense which a Government employee is expected to bear from his or her salary." 1 GAO, PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW at 4-103 &#x0026; n.58 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also id. </span>at 4-103 ("In addition to the obvious reason that food is a personal expense and government salaries are presumed adequate to enable employees to eat regularly, furnishing free food might violate 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5536, which prohibits an employee from receiving compensation in addition to the pay and allowances fixed by law.") (footnote omitted). Providing bottled water when safe and drinkable tap water is available would serve no purpose other than accommodating employees' personal tastes--a purpose that generally cannot justify the expenditure of appropriated funds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The general rule prohibiting such expenditures serves to "ensure public confidence in the integrity of those who spend the taxpayers['] money." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 4-108. In light of this overriding goal, the prohibition on bottled water when safe and drinkable tap water is available strikes us as the correct application of the Purpose Statute. Therefore, if the tap water at the Newport facilities is safe and drinkable, the purchase of bottled water with appropriated funds would violate federal appropriations law--and the Navy would have no authority or duty to bargain with the unions before discontinuing the provision of free bottled water. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Agency for Int'l Development</span>, B-247871 ("We conclude that the OIG may use appropriated funds to purchase bottled drinking water for its employees <span class="Italic">until the problems with the building's water supply are adequately corrected and the water is shown to be safe</span>.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The remaining question is whether the tap water at the Newport facilities is in fact safe to drink.&#x2003;The Navy argues that the decisions in the related Cain arbitrations conclusively establish that the tap water is safe to drink. Those arbitrations were not in the record before the Authority. The Navy did, however, raise at every stage of the proceedings the argument that the tap water was safe to drink and that the Navy therefore had no discretion to provide bottled water. Under the circumstances, we think the prudent course is to remand to the Authority for it to assess the Cain arbitrations and the more fundamental question whether the tap water is in fact safe to drink. If the water at the Newport facilities <span class="Italic">is </span>safe to drink, then the Authority must rule for the Navy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We grant the petition for review, vacate the FLRA's order, and remand this case for the Authority to determine whether the tap water is in fact safe to drink. If the tap water is in fact safe to drink, the FLRA must rule for the Navy.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings consistent with the court's opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The background is set forth fully in <span class="Italic">Undersea Warfare</span> and is only briefly summarized here. In the mid-1990s, the Agency began using appropriated funds to provide bottled water to Agency buildings that contained lead-contaminated water fountains. <span class="Italic">Undersea Warfare</span>, 64 FLRA at 1136. Over time, the Agency began to provide bottled water to some buildings that did not have lead-contaminated fountains, and it began to replace lead-contaminated fountains with lead-free fountains. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> After July of 2006, the Agency tested fountains for lead and determined that water from the fountains was safe for drinking. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Based on this determination, the Agency unilaterally discontinued its practice of providing bottled water. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Unions filed grievances alleging that the Agency improperly ended its practice of providing bottled water without first negotiating with the Unions.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1136-37. The grievances were unresolved and submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As relevant here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency was obligated to continue its practice of providing bottled water. <span class="Italic">Id</span> at 1137<span class="Italic">.</span> The Arbitrator also found that the Agency was required to bargain before changing this established past practice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition, he rejected the Agency's reliance on federal appropriations laws and decisions of the United States Comptroller General (Comptroller General). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to resume providing bottled water at no charge to the employees in the buildings where it previously had done so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority's Decision in Undersea Warfare</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed exceptions to the Arbitrator's award, claiming that the award was contrary to: (1) the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1341; (2) the Purpose Statute, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a); and (3) Comptroller General decisions concerning the use of appropriations for bottled water. <span class="Italic">Undersea Warfare</span>, 64 FLRA at 1137-38. The Authority noted that the parties did not dispute that the Agency's provision of bottled water for many years was an established past practice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1139. And the Authority found that the Agency could not change this condition of employment without fulfilling its bargaining obligations unless a statute or regulation precluded such bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority determined that the Anti-Deficiency Act, the Purpose Statute, and Comptroller General decisions did not prohibit such negotiations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the Authority denied the Agency's exceptions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1140.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Court's Decision in Navy v. FLRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the court found that the Agency's duty to bargain "depends on whether federal appropriations law permits the purchase of bottled water where safe and drinkable tap water is available." <span class="Italic">Navy v. FLRA</span>, 665 F.3d at 1348. Applying the "necessary expense doctrine" set forth in Comptroller General precedent, the court held that "[b]ottled water is considered necessary--and thus may be purchased with appropriated funds--when the available water posed a health risk if consumed, or because water was not available." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1350 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court agreed with the Comptroller General's interpretation of the Purpose Statute that an agency would violate that statute by providing bottled water when safe and drinkable water is available. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court vacated the Authority's decision and remanded it to the Authority "to determine whether the tap water is in fact safe to drink." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1351. In this connection, the court held that the Authority should assess the arbitration awards of Arbitrator Laurie G. Cain (the Cain arbitrations)--which involve whether the water is potable-even though "[t]hose arbitrations were not in the record before the Authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court remanded this matter to the Authority to determine whether, in fact, the tap water at the Agency buildings is safe to drink, and to assess the decisions in the Cain arbitrations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In reviewing an arbitration award, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings because the parties bargained for the facts to be found by an arbitrator chosen by them. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor</span>, 62 FLRA 153, 156 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Air Traffic Controllers Ass'n</span>, 60 FLRA 398, 400 (2004); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2612</span>, 55 FLRA 483, 486 (1999). <span class="Italic">Cf. United Paperworkers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29, 37-38 (1987) ("Because the parties have contracted to have disputes settled by an arbitrator chosen by them rather than by a judge, it is the arbitrator's view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that they have agreed to accept."). In addition, the Authority does not supplement an arbitrator's findings by engaging in its own factfinding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Wash., D.C.</span>, 64 FLRA 426, 431 (2010); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222</span>, 54 FLRA 1267, 1275 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting as to other matters).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These principles support a conclusion that the Arbitrator, whom the parties in this case chose to make factual findings, should have the first opportunity to address the issues that the court remanded.
