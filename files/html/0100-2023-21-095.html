<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-95"><span id="Page_4204"></span><span class="space">E.</span> DEATH BENEFITS; LUMP SUM PAYMENTS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Death benefits were described by <span class="Italic">Bottrell v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 338, 340 n.2 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Death benefits" are defined in the Federal personnel Manual supplement at Chapter 831-1, Subchapter S17-1 (September 21, 1981), as either a survivor annuity or a lump-sum payment. The statutes dealing with these two types of benefits are codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8341 (survivor annuity) and 8342 (lump-sum payments).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a CSRS or FERS employee or annuitant dies, benefits may be payable, on a periodic basis, to a surviving spouse, to a former spouse under a court order, to dependent unmarried children and to unmarried disabled dependent children; a lump sum benefit payment may be payable in the amount of the unpaid balance of retirement contributions, if death occurs after the employee leaves federal employment and before retirement, if there is no survivor annuity that is payable. [Refer to later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-21-102.html#sec14-101">Survivor Annuities.</a>"] The complexities of the distribution scheme are explained on the OPM website at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/survivors/">https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/survivors/</a>, stating in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lump Sum Benefit</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If no survivor annuity is payable upon the employee/former employee's death, a lump sum may be payable of the unpaid balance of retirement contributions made by the employee. This lump sum is payable under the order of precedence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lump sum payments may be available under 5 USC 8341 if there is no survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 163, 168 (1988) (determining date of separation of employee under unique set of facts for purpose of determining whether the annuitant's husband had a right to a survivor annuity or whether the annuitant's children had a right to lump sum payments upon the annuitant's death). "5 USC 8342 precludes OPM from honoring a designation of beneficiary if it is not received by OPM prior to the individual's death." <span class="Italic">Ryan v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 126, 127 (1991). Somewhat opaquely, the interplay between surviving spouse annuities and lump sum death benefits was explored to a degree in <span class="Italic">Pinnix v. OPM</span>, 19 MSPR 449, 450 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341, the deceased employee's surviving spouse and stepchild qualified for survivor annuities upon the death of the employee. <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S17-2 (September 21, 1981). Inasmuch as the deceased employee was survived by a spouse and stepchild who were entitled to survivor annuities, a lump-sum benefit was payable to appellant, who is the deceased employee's niece and allegedly properly designated beneficiary under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), if the survivors' annuities terminated before they had received in annuities an amount equal to the employee's lump-sum credit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342 (e). <span class="Italic">See also</span> PPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S17-9 (September 21, 1981). However, the lump-sum credit was exhausted by the statutorily authorized annuities payments to the survivors so that no benefit was payable to appellant. Therefore, appellant did not carry her burden of showing by preponderant evidence that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(e) she was entitled to receive a lump-sum benefit. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 8 MSPR 471 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The death benefit was also explained in <span class="Italic">Stubblefield v. OPM</span>, SF-0831-15-0477-I-1 (NP 6/20/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A lump-sum benefit is to be paid, based on the service of a deceased Federal employee, if that service does not entitle anyone to a survivor annuity at the time of the decedent's death. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8341, 8342(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(10), defining a "survivor."

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge made the following findings of fact, which the parties do not dispute. The appellant's parents were married almost 42 years when his father, Daniel Devlin Sr., died on January 26, 2010. At the time of his death, Mr. Devlin was a current FERS-covered employee of the Department of Defense with approximately 6 years of civilian service to his credit. Following her husband's death, the appellant's mother, Darlene Devlin, started to prepare an Application for Death Benefits, Standard Form (SF) 3104, but she died on February 12, 2010, before she could sign or file it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 1, 2010, the appellant and his brother, co-administrators of their mother's estate, completed, signed, and filed the SF 3104, seeking the basic employee death benefit to which Mrs. Devlin would have been entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b) as the current spouse and widow of a federal employee. OPM denied the application, but paid the estate with interest the FERS contributions that Mr. Devlin had made. The appellant filed a Board appeal and the administrative judge affirmed OPM's decision on the basis that the estate was not legally entitled to apply for or receive the benefit. The appellant has filed a petition for review disputing the administrative judge's interpretation of the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The entitlement to a death benefit based on the service of an employee who dies while still in duty status is set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b), and in OPM's implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.309. If a federal employee under FERS dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, but before accruing 10 years of civilian service, the employee's qualifying current spouse is entitled to receive the basic employee death benefit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">see Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 256 F.3d 1360, 1361-62 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 843.102, .309(a). The appellant bears the burden of proving entitlement to the death benefit. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 560, 564 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 979 F.2d 216 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is a case of first impression before the Board, the issue being whether the estate of a current spouse may apply for and receive the section 8442(b)(1)(A) death benefit on the spouse's behalf. For the following reasons, we agree with the administrative judge that it cannot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the application for benefits, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.302 does not provide for application by an estate. It only permits the "current or former spouse" to apply, and a current or former spouse is by definition a "living person." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.102. As for the receipt of benefits, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b) provides only that a "widow or widower" is entitled to payment of the death benefit.[2] It would therefore appear that the purpose of the FERS death benefit is to make provision for the employee's surviving spouse--not to augment her estate. This interpretation of the statute is consistent with decisions in similar cases standing for the proposition that the right to file for an annuity is personal to the annuitant.[3] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 938 F.2d 1283, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (an administrator cannot file a posthumous application for disability retirement benefits on behalf of a deceased spouse); <span class="Italic">Oshiver ex. rel. Oshiver v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 896 F.2d 540, 541-42 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (the spouse of a "missing" employee cannot file for a retirement annuity on behalf of the employee). It is also consistent with OPM's regulations, which define the basic employee death benefit as <span id="Page_4205"></span>"the payment to the current spouse of a deceased employee...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.102 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;There is a statutory provision that allows fiduciaries to receive death benefit payment on behalf of individuals under legal disability. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8466(c). This provision, however, does not provide for receipt of payment on behalf of a deceased individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We acknowledge that the basic employee death benefit is distinct from the annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(3). Nevertheless, both the death benefit and the annuity are "[r]ights of a widow or widower." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the term "current spouse" is used only to establish eligibility and entitlement to the basic employee death benefit, and not for payment of the benefit. The regulations, however, allow for payment to a qualifying current spouse's estate only if she was already receiving installment payments at the time of her death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.309(c)(2) (If a current spouse "who was receiving" the death benefit in installments dies, her estate will be paid the remaining portion in a lump sum).[4] It is undisputed that Mrs. Devlin was not receiving such installment payments. Moreover, regardless of whether OPM might be allowed to make payments to the estate, the appellant's argument does not address the basic issue of whether the estate could establish its own entitlement to the death benefit. For the reasons explained above, we find that it cannot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We find no contradiction between this regulatory exception and the statutory language providing that the "widow or widower is entitled to" the death benefit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b). Once the widow or widower applies for the benefit to which she is entitled, she has a property interest in it regardless of whether she has actually received it. <span class="Italic">See Cushman v. Shinseki</span>, 576 F.3d 1290, 1297-98 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The death benefit may therefore pass to her estate as part of the property that she owned during her life.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 256 F.3d 1360, which the administrative judge addressed in her initial decision, "suggests that there is an open question regarding appeals of this nature...and...the letter of the law is not clear enough on such cases." We disagree. <span class="Italic">Clark</span> was factually similar to the instant appeal to the extent that the employee's surviving current spouse died before applying for the benefit. There was, however, no need for the court in <span class="Italic">Clark</span> to decide the issue now before the Board. In denying the estate's application for death benefit, OPM followed the principles of an Alabama law under which one who feloniously and intentionally takes the life of another person is deemed to have predeceased his victim, who was in that case the deceased employee. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 256 F.3d at 1361. The appellant reads too much in the administrative judge's comment that <span class="Italic">Clark</span> "leaves open the possibility that an estate may seek the [basic employee death benefit]." The administrative judge only meant that <span class="Italic">Clark</span> did not resolve the issue in the instant appeal. For the reasons explained above, we agree with the administrative judge that the estate of a current spouse may not apply for and receive the section 8442(b)(1)(A) death benefit on her behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The equities of this case are compelling. Mr. and Mrs. Devlin were married for over 40 years and they passed away within 3 weeks of one another. It is undisputed that Mrs. Devlin met the basic death benefit eligibility criteria and that she would have been entitled to receive it while she was alive. Nor can Mrs. Devlin be faulted for not submitting the application in a timely manner. Even shortly after her husband's death, she acted diligently in preparing the application for death benefits and was prevented from completing it only by her own passing. Nevertheless, the equities of the situation do not empower OPM or the Board to award monetary benefits in the absence of statutory authorization. A claim for payment of money from the public treasury that is contrary to a statutory appropriation is prohibited by the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, art. I, &#x00A7; 9, cl. 7, and the government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 424, 434 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Devlin v. OPM</span>, 767 F.3d 1285, 1287-88 (Fed. Cir. 2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with both parties that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1)(A) does not clearly answer the question of whether a surviving spouse's estate may apply for BEDB on her behalf. The relevant portion of that statute provides: "[i]f an employee dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under section 8411 and is survived by a <span class="Italic">widow or widower</span>, the <span class="Italic">widow or widower</span> is entitled to [BEDB]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1)(A) (emphases added). There is no indication in the statute whether Congress intended to limit entitlement to BEDB to only the surviving "widow or widower" or to also include the surviving spouse's estate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the statute's silence, we look to the interpretation provided by OPM, the agency Congress charged with prescribing regulations to carry out the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442, to interpret the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(g). The OPM regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442 provide that a "current spouse" who meets certain requirements "is entitled to the basic employee death benefit...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.309. As to the application for those benefits, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.302 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A <span class="Italic">current or former spouse</span> of a deceased retiree, employee, or separated employee may file an application for benefits under this subpart, personally or through a representative, at any time within 30 years after the death of the retiree, employee, or separated employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added). A "current spouse" is defined as "a living person who is married to the employee...at the time of the employee's...death." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.102. Inserting this definition of current spouse into 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.302: "[a living person who is married to the employee...at the time of the employee's...death] may file an application for benefits...." The plain language of the regulation requires the current spouse to be living at the time of his or her application for BEDB.[1] We reject Mr. Devlin's contention that this definition only requires the current spouse to be living at the time of the employee's death.[2] As written, the "living person" requirement is separate and distinct from the "married to the employee" requirement. While it is true that the regulation allows the current spouse to file for benefits "through a representative," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.302, it nonetheless requires the representative to be of the current spouse--i.e., of a living person. The executor or administrator of an estate is not the representative of a living person and thus cannot apply for BEDB on behalf of a surviving spouse under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A "former spouse" is defined as "a living person who was married...to an employee...an whose marriage to the employee...was terminated before the death of the employee." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.102. Thus, a former spouse must also be living at the time of his or her application for BEDB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Devlin's interpretation would be proper if the regulation defined current spouse as "a person who is married to the employee <span class="Italic">and is living</span> at the time of the employee's death." But it does not. His interpretation is not consistent with the plain language of the regulation and would render the "living person" requirement superfluous: you could not be married to the employee at the time of his death unless you were alive at the time of the employee's death.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with Mr. Devlin that OPM's interpretation is inconsistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Cushman v. Shinseki</span>, 576 F.3d 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2009). There, we held that "[a] veteran is entitled to disability benefits <span class="Italic">upon a showing</span> that he meets the eligibility requirements set forth in the governing statute and regulations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1298 (emphasis added). We concluded that "such entitlement to benefits is a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case, however, Mrs. Devlin did not show that she was eligible for BEDB--she failed to file an application that would have established her eligibility. And filing the application for BEDB was a necessary prerequisite for entitlement to those benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8466 (benefits "shall not be paid...unless an application therefor is received by the Office"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(2)(a) ("No benefit is payable under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442], until after the claimant has applied for the benefit in the form prescribed by OPM."). Because she did not file the necessary application, Mrs. Devlin was not entitled to BEDB and thus had no protected property interest in those benefits. As such, Mrs. Devlin's estate could have no protected property interest in the BEDB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that OPM's interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1)(A), as reflected in its implementing regulations, is reasonable and not contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Murray v. OPM</span>, NY-844E-21-0093-I-1 (NP 4/25/2023) (complex statutory and regulatory analysis: "decedent's status as an 'employee' was dispositive in determining the appellant's entitlements upon his death"; separation from agency prior to death opened possibility for employee to qualify as retiree or annuitant entitled to disability annuity, but not as to individual who was employee at time of his death),</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The order of succession is not changed by an antinuptial agreement if no written designation is filed with OPM to change the statutory distribution scheme. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mackey v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 158, 161 (1992). A lump sum death benefit cannot be conferred by a divorce decree. <span class="Italic">Walker v. OPM</span>, 81 MSPR 377, 380 (1999). A designation of a beneficiary for a lump sum death benefit payment is not revoked by a divorce decree. Only another SF-2808 election form will prevent the operation of the prior designation, <span class="Italic">Alexander v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 358, 362 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant was not entitled to the lump-sum payment under the law. As the administrative judge noted in his initial decision, in 1977, the decedent executed a Standard Form (SF) 2808 designating Jean Masursky Martin (Mrs. Martin), a former spouse, as the beneficiary of his lump-sum survivor benefits, and the appellant did not dispute that there was no subsequent SF-2808 changing the designated beneficiary. Even though the decedent's and Mrs. Martin's divorce decree stated that he was to be awarded all of his retirement benefits, that document was insufficient to cancel his prior designation of beneficiary on the SF-2808 <span id="Page_4206"></span>because cancellation of a prior designation of a beneficiary on an SF-2808 can be made only upon the execution of a new SF-2808 received by OPM before the employee's death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c). Any other document that attempts to make such a change of beneficiary has no legal effect. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Thus, because a valid form SF-2808 that designated Mrs. Martin as the decedent's beneficiary existed, OPM was required under the law to award the lump-sum benefits to her and not to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c); <span class="Italic">Bottrell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 MSPR 338, 3443 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 867 F.2d 1421, 1422 (Fed. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as the administrative judge correctly found, the decedent's employing agency, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Flagstaff, Arizona, had no obligation to advise the decedent to submit a new SF-2808 either upon his remarriage or at the time of his retirement, and OPM had no obligation to issue a new reconsideration decision when it awarded the appellant the second lump-sum benefit. Moreover, under <span class="Italic">Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. at 416, 434, any such error by the USGS or by OPM could not have estopped OPM from assessing the appellant the overpayment inasmuch as she was not otherwise entitled to the lump-sum payment under the law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly disclaiming the effect of a divorce decree on a designation of a lump sum beneficiary, <span class="Italic">Soroka v. OPM</span>, 557 Fed. Appx. 983, 985-86 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the board correctly determined, Mr. Soroka was not entitled to receive his son's FERS lump sum death benefit. "[i]t is a bedrock canon of statutory construction that our judicial inquiry ends where statutory language is plain and unambiguous." <span class="Italic">White v. United States</span>, 543 F.3d 1330, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">see Conn. Nat'l Bank v. Germain</span>, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992) ("We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there."). Section 8424(d) unambiguously provides that OPM must "[f]irst" pay FERS lump sum death benefits "to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee or Member in a signed and witnessed writing received [by OPM] before the death of such employee or Member." In 1999, Jeffrey Soroka filed a signed and witnessed SF-3102 designation of beneficiary form with OPM which listed Hoffman as the sole beneficiary of his FERS death benefits. No updated beneficiary designation form has been produced. Although Mr. Soroka recalled that he, his wife, and his son completed some forms after his son's divorce, he did not "have any specific recollection of completing [an updated SF-3102 form] and sending it to...OPM." Because the record contains only one SF-3102 designation of beneficiary form--and that form lists Hoffman as Jeffrey Soroka's designated beneficiary--the board correctly determined that OPM was required to distribute the lump sum death benefit to Hoffman. The plain language of section 8424(d) "does not afford OPM or the Board any discretion to award" benefits to an individual other than the "person designated as beneficiary in a form properly filed with OPM." <span class="Italic">Landsberger v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 13, 16-17 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 956 F.2d 1174 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see also Ferguson v. Long</span>, 885 F. Supp.2d 294, 297 (D.D.C. 2012) (concluding that the proceeds from a decedent's Federal Thrift Savings Plan ("TSP") retirement account were required to be distributed to the decedent's father, rather than her husband, because the only "'signed and witnessed writing'" that had been submitted listed her father as her beneficiary (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(d)); <span class="Italic">Alston v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Jeffrey Soroka's default judgment of divorce stated that he was to receive "all interest in his retirement and TSP plans" and "any accumulated contributions in any pension, annuity, or retirement system[.] " Section 8424(d) specifically provides, however, that "a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document" which is not signed, witnessed and filed with OPM will have "no force or effect" on an employee's beneficiary designation. Thus, notwithstanding the provisions in Jeffrey Soroka's divorce decree regarding the disposition of his retirement benefits, neither this court nor the board has the authority to require OPM to award lump sum death benefits in a manner contrary to the unequivocal dictates of section 8424(d). OPM is prohibited from granting benefits not authorized by law regardless of the equities involved. <span class="Italic">Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 424-34 (1990).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also shows that in 1987 Jeffrey Soroka signed and submitted an SF-1152 designation of beneficiary form which indicated that upon his death any "unpaid compensation" would be paid to his parents, Richard and Arlene Soroka. Form SF-1152, however, is used solely to designate the beneficiary of any unpaid compensation--such as unpaid salary or accrued leave--not to designate the beneficiary of an employee's lump sum death benefit. Form SF-1152 specifically states that it has no effect on the disposition of any retirement benefits to which an employee might be entitled. <span class="Italic">See Board Decision</span>, 2013 MSPB LEXIS 4351, at *6 n.4.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Payne v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 389, 394 (1989), matters pertaining to the status of a beneficiary of death benefits, an issue of domestic relations, is to be decided under state law. Any challenge to a court judgment affecting the distribution of death benefits must be decided by the court, not by the Board. When a lump sum benefit entitlement was claimed and there was a question of whether the employee was deceased, the law of the nation governing property distribution (the Philippine Code) was consulted to determine whether there was, under the facts, a presumption of death. <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. OPM</span>, 64 MSPR 534, 536-38 (1994). If the issue is one of the validity and duration of a marriage leading to a claim for death benefits, the Board examines the state law governing the marital relationship. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williamson v. OPM</span>, 106 MSPR 146, 2007 MSPB 154 (2007) (considering state law of Oklahoma governing common law marriage).

<p class="Body-Text">The Board must resolve a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> challenge to the mental competence of an annuitant's designation of a lump sum beneficiary, as implied by <span class="Italic">Stubblefield v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 455, 459 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the intervenor was not entitled to a survivor annuity, and to the extent the intervenor challenges this finding in his petition, he has not satisfied the criteria for review set forth under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115. In the absence of such a survivor interest, the appellant, as the decedent's sole designated beneficiary, is entitled to receive lump-sum death benefits based on the decedent's service. This entitlement vanishes, however, if the form designating the appellant as the decedent's beneficiary is deemed to be invalid. Accordingly, we must determine if allegations of insufficient mental capacity regarding a designation of beneficiary raise an issue of invalidity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that annuity elections are only valid if made by mentally competent individuals. Such competency is presumed, absent challenge, and the party seeking to change the annuity agreement of record bears the burden of showing that the annuitant lacked the requisite capacity to make a valid election. We find that the same principle applies to the designation of beneficiaries to receive lump-sum death benefits. Consequently, if the decedent in this case lacked the requisite mental capacity at the time he designated the appellant as his beneficiary, the right to lump-sum benefits would pass to the intervenor, as next in line of succession under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distribution of a lump sum benefit upon an employee's death was described by <span class="Italic">Wengel v. OPM</span>, 100 MSPR 11, 12-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-11 (2005), expressing the inflexible nature of the statutory distribution scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(d), if an employee dies leaving no survivor with an interest in a survivor annuity, OPM must pay to the appropriate party the lump-sum credit for funds remaining in the employee's retirement account, and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c) sets forth the order of precedence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Lump-sum benefits authorized by subsections (d)-(f) of this section shall be paid to the person or persons surviving the employee and alive at the date title to the payment arises in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee in a signed and witnessed writing received in the Office before his death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of <span id="Page_4207"></span>beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Second, if there is no designated beneficiary, to the widow or widower of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of the employee and descendants of deceased children by representation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of the employee or the survivor of them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Sixth, if none of the above, to such other next of kin of the employee as the Office determines to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the employee at the date of his death.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c). The appellant does not dispute that OPM has no written designation of beneficiary from Eric Wengel and that he had no spouse or children. By operation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), Eric Wengel's only living parent, Murray Wengel, would receive the lump-sum benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 16, 2003, Murray Wengel executed an irrevocable disclaimer and renunciation of his interest in the lump-sum benefit as provided for by section 2-1.11. of New York's Estates, Powers and Trusts Law. The appellant argues that he is entitled to the lump-sum benefit as the executor of Eric Wengel's estate because under New York law his father's renunciation has the same effect with respect to the renounced interest as though the renouncing person had predeceased the decedent, <span class="Italic">citing id.,</span> section 2-1.11(d). The administrative judge accepted this argument, <span class="Italic">citing to Alvarez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 534, 536 (1994), as authority for looking to state law to determine questions relevant to the disposition of federal benefits under the CSRS. The administrative judge ordered OPM to grant the appellant's application for the benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue before us on petition for review is whether the administrative judge erred in giving effect to the irrevocable disclaimer and renunciation signed by Murray Wengel. The result of an effective disclaimer is to require OPM to pass over Murray Wengel in the statutory order of precedence under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c) in favor of David Wengel as the executor of Eric Wengel's estate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This question is one of statutory interpretation. The starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself, which governs absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Taxera v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 6 (2003). The statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c) directs OPM to pay the lump-sum benefit in the order of precedence set forth. Only when there is no properly designated beneficiary, widow, widower, or child of the employee does the lump-sum benefit devolve to the parents or parent survivor. Likewise, only when this category of beneficiary fails does the benefit pass to the executor of the estate. The statute makes no provision for disposition of the benefit through an irrevocable disclaimer or renunciation. OPM's implementing regulation similarly provides no exception to the statutory order of precedence by disclaimer or renunciation. 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart T.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the disclaimer should be given the force and effect that it has under New York state law. The Board has applied substantive state law to determine the proper recipient of a lump-sum benefit when necessary to identify a member of the statutory class in the order of precedence. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Alvarez,</span> the Board applied the law of the Philippines, which provides that an absentee may be presumed dead for purposes of succession after an absence of 10 years, to find that the decedent's widow was presumed dead and that, the category of widow having been eliminated as a statutory beneficiary under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), the appellant and his two sisters were entitled to the lump-sum benefit. <span class="Italic">Alvarez,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. at 536. In other words, under Philippine law, absence was sufficient proof to establish the death of an individual, unless evidence to rebut the presumption existed. Here, Murray Wengel is clearly alive, and New York state law would treat him as if he predeceased Eric Wengel for the purposes of disposing of property interests created by will, trust agreement, and various other instruments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thomas-Rivas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 334 (1992), the appellant claimed to be the child of the decedent whose right to the lump-sum was superior to the decedent's mother's right. The Board applied the law of El Salvador to find that the appellant proved he was the child of the decedent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 337-39. On review, the court, in an unpublished decision, reversed the Board's finding that the appellant proved that he was the decedent's child, without disturbing the general proposition of law that paternity should be determined under the law of the state or foreign country with the most significant interest in the parent-child relationship. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 996 F.2d 317 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Thomas-Rivas,</span> the Board applied the domestic relations law of El Salvador to determine family relationships. <span class="Italic">Thomas-Rivas,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. at 337-39. As OPM points out in its petition for review, there is no federal domestic relations law. Our reviewing court has long held that OPM and its predecessor the Civil Service Commission properly use state law only to identify which surviving spouse was <span class="Italic">married</span> to a decedent at the time of his death, not to determine property entitlement rights. <span class="Italic">Money v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 811 F.2d 1474, 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Here, the appellant does not seek to resort to state law to qualify him as a member of a class of potential beneficiaries or to determine family relationships. Rather, he would use state law to determine that his class, executor, should have a property right in the benefit superior to the right of the class statutorily ahead of his. The appellant has not offered any legal support, other than New York state cases, which are not binding precedent for the Board, for his argument that New York state law should be given effect here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized an individual's right to waive irrevocably her entitlement to a survivor annuity. In <span class="Italic">Mulroy v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2002), the Board found that a former spouse entitled to a survivor annuity could waive that right in favor of the annuitant. <span class="Italic">See also Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Worley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-15 (2000), the Board gave effect to the appellant's waiver of a survivor annuity so that she could receive a lump-sum payment of the unpaid retirement contributions. In contrast to the circumstance in this appeal, however, the right to decline to accept an annuity is specifically provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d). The statute provides no such mechanism for renouncing or waiving a lump-sum benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Mulroy</span> and <span class="Italic">Shelley,</span> the waiver did not result in a distribution of the lump-sum benefit. In <span class="Italic">Worley,</span> the appellant herself became entitled to the lump-sum once her right to a survivor annuity was extinguished. In enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), Congress provided a specific statutory scheme for distribution of an available lump-sum benefit by placing the choice of recipient in the hands of the employee or annuitant, first to designate a beneficiary in a prescribed fashion or alternatively to allow the benefit to pass by operation of the statute. Congress has not indicated any intention to permit another individual, after the employee's death, to affect the results of the employee's action or inaction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vecchio v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 464, 474-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22 (2003), briefly touched on the differences in designations of beneficiaries under CSRS and FERS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The retirement system to which the decedent was subject at the time of her death is a potentially dispositive issue in this appeal because the two systems, CSRS and FERS, have different requirements regarding the means by which an employee may file an effective designation of beneficiary form. CSRS Offset employees are generally subject to the same rules as CSRS employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1001 ("Except as provided under [Subpart J of 5 C.F.R. Part 831, CSRS Offset] employees and Members are treated the same as other covered employees and Members under the CSRS."). With respect to the filing requirements for a designation of beneficiary form for a lump-sum payment, the CSRS regulations provide that the form "must be in writing, signed, and witnessed, and received in OPM before the death of the designator." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2005(a). These regulations also provide, "No change or cancellation of beneficiary in a last will or testament, or in any other document not witnessed and filed as required by this section, has any force or effect." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2005(b). The Board has found that a CSRS designation of beneficiary form filed with the employing agency, which is not forwarded to and received by OPM prior to the employee's death, is ineffective. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 423, 426 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 168 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table); <span class="Italic">Finch v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 221, 227 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the FERS regulations provide that a designation of beneficiary form "must be in writing, signed, and witnessed, and received <span class="Italic">in the employing office</span> (or in OPM, in the case of a retiree, or a compensationer, or a separated employee) before the death of a designator." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.205(a) (emphasis added). The FERS regulations also provide, "A change or cancellation of beneficiary in a last will or testament, or in any other document not witnessed and filed as required by this section, will not have any force or effect." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.205(b). Thus, unlike an employee covered by CSRS Offset, an employee covered by FERS may file an effective designation of beneficiary form with the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Friedman v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 395 (1982), affirmed that formal designations must be filed with OPM to secure lump sum payments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...She now admits that the proper form was not filed either with the agency or with OPM, but she contends that formalities should not govern where the evidence otherwise indicates the decedent's intent to designate a given beneficiary. OPM responded that regardless of intent, appellant cannot prevail as a matter of law because the statute requires a filing.[2] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. 8342(c) requires that a designation of beneficiary for a lump-sum death benefit be filed with OPM before the death of the employee making the designation. Appellant admits that the form designating her as beneficiary was never filed with OPM. Furthermore, the deceased <span id="Page_4208"></span>designated other relatives as beneficiaries in a form properly filed with OPM in 1974. Appellant's claim must fail because the statutory language does not give the Board any discretion to award appellant beneficiary status over another person designated as beneficiary in a form properly filed with OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. 8342(c) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Lump-sum benefits authorized by subsections (dMf) of this section shall be paid...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee or member in a signed and witnessed writing <span class="Italic">received in the Office before his death</span>. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document <span class="Italic">not</span> so executed and <span class="Italic">filed has no force and effect</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Landsberger v. OPM</span>, 50 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1991), determined that a formal designation of beneficiary filed for lump sum benefits takes precedence irrespective of equities favoring a different distribution:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In pertinent part, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n annuitant who dies before the date of final adjudication [of his retirement application] is deemed to have made an affirmative election under paragraph (a)..., and the lump-sum credit will be paid in accordance with the order of precedence established under 5 U.S.C. 8342(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that, because Mr. Landsberger died before the final adjudication of his retirement application, OPM correctly determined that the statutory order of precedence should be followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), requires that a designation of beneficiary for a lump-sum death benefit be filed with OPM before the death of the employee making the designation.[4] There is no evidence that a form designating the appellant and her minor child as beneficiaries was ever filed with OPM. Furthermore, the deceased designated other relatives as beneficiaries in a form properly filed with OPM in 1967. The appellant's claim must fail because the statutory language does not afford OPM or the Board any discretion to award her and her daughter beneficiary status over another person designated as beneficiary in a form properly filed with OPM. <span class="Italic">See Friedman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. 395, 396-97 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee...in a signed and witnessed writing received [by OPM] before his death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge considered the issue in this appeal to be one of intent, and she determined that the evidence showed that the decedent intended to bequeath the lump-sum benefit to his spouse and minor child. The administrative judge erred, however, in considering intent in this appeal. Once she found that there was a designation of beneficiary properly filed with OPM, the administrative judge need not have proceeded further. The appellant and her daughter could not prevail, because the applicable law afforded no discretion to award benefits to one other than the properly designated beneficiary. <span class="Italic">Friedman</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. at 396-97.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the administrative judge found relevant the consideration that an official at Mr. Landsberger's former employing agency provided him inadequate advice concerning his retirement. As a rule, however, the government may not be estopped from denying monetary benefits not otherwise permitted by law, even if the appellant was denied those benefits because of his reliance upon the erroneous statements of its agents. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v.

On review, the appellant states again that he and the decedent never knew their biological father and that he is the only heir and personal representative of the decedent's estate. Although we sympathize with the appellant's situation, the administrative judge correctly explained that OPM has no authority to exercise discretion in its application of the order of precedence established by statute.

<p class="Body-Text">For a claim to be honored for a death benefit under FERS, any superior claim of a person with an interest in either a survivor annuity or other death benefit must be irrevocably waived, <span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, 109 MSPR 499, 501-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8, 2008 MSPB 176 (2008) (overruled in part, <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, 120 MSPR 440, 2013 MSPB 95 (2013)) (FERS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under FERS, lump-sum benefits will be paid if an employee dies "(1) without a survivor, or (2) with a survivor or survivors and the right of all survivors under subchapter IV terminates before a claim for survivor annuity under such subchapter is filed." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(e). Laurel and David Press were married on September 18, 1976. They were legally separated in California Superior Court, Madera County on July 26, 2004; however, the marriage was neither dissolved nor annulled. As a separated but not divorced spouse, Mr. Press falls within the definition of a current spouse under FERS. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.102. As Laurel Press' husband for more than 9 months at the time of her death and as the father of children by that marriage, Mr. Press is considered her widower and survivor under Subchapter IV of FERS. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8441(2). As her widower, Mr. Press is entitled to a one-time payment and a survivor annuity based upon Laurel Press' federal service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1). Therefore, unless Mr. Press' right as a survivor has terminated, no lump-sum credit can be paid to the appellant under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FERS statute states that the survivor annuity of a widower terminates when he dies or when he remarries before becoming 55 years of age. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(d)(1). The appellant has provided no evidence that Mr. Press either remarried prior to age 55 or has died. However, the Board has previously held with regard to an identical provision in title 5 concerning the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(d)) that death and remarriage are not the only possible terminating events. <span class="Italic">Worley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). The Board in <span class="Italic">Worley</span> held that, because an individual entitled to an annuity may decline to accept all or part of an annuity, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d), an irrevocable waiver could terminate a survivor's right to an annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10. The FERS statute contains a provision which is identical to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) and states that an individual entitled to an annuity "may decline to accept all or any part of the amount of the annuity by a waiver signed and filed with [OPM] . The waiver may be revoked in writing at any time." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465(a). For the appellant to receive the lump-sum death benefits he seeks, he must demonstrate that Mr. Press' right as a survivor under FERS has been terminated by an irrevocable waiver. To be effective, such a waiver must be signed and filed with OPM and must expressly state that it is irrevocable. <span class="Italic">See Mulroy v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 17 (2002); <span class="Italic">Shelley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective August 16, 2002, Laurel and David Press entered into a Marital Settlement Agreement, which divided their property. As part of that agreement, both parties agreed to "waive all of their rights to all such survivor benefits under such parties' separate property pension plan." That agreement also transferred to Laurel Press' sole possession "full interest in the Pension Plan held by the United States Postal Service." The appellant asserts that this is a sufficient and effective waiver of Mr. Press' survivor annuity. However, this waiver does not expressly state that it is irrevocable and, although OPM is now aware of it due to this litigation, there is no evidence that it was ever filed with OPM. Therefore, the Marital Settlement Agreement is insufficient to terminate Mr. Press' right to a survivor annuity pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465(a). <span class="Italic">See Mulroy v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;We note that in <span class="Italic">Worley, Mulroy,</span> and <span class="Italic">Shelley,</span> the Board invited the spouses, who were either the appellant or an intervenor in those appeals, to file such an irrevocable waiver with OPM. <span class="Italic">Mulroy,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">Shelley,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Worley,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 237, 1116. If Mr. Press were an intervenor in this appeal, he could similarly be invited to file an irrevocable waiver; however, he has not intervened and we note that the appellant has expressly requested that he not be invited to do so. It is unclear from the record whether the AJ attempted to provide Mr. Press with an opportunity to intervene. If the AJ failed to do so, it was error because Mr. Press' annuity rights were directly affected by the AJ's decision. <span class="Italic">See Fletcher v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 41 M.S.P.R. 445, 448-49 (1989). However, it is unnecessary to invite him to intervene at this stage because his rights are not adversely affected by the outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if the appellant were able to show that Mr. Press had irrevocably waived his right to a survivor annuity, the appellant still has not shown that, as one of the adult children of Laurel Press, he is entitled to the lump-sum benefit he seeks. Under FERS, if an employee dies without a survivor, a lump-sum benefit will be paid in accordance with the statutory order of precedence at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(d). The first beneficiary is one designated by the employee in a signed and witnessed writing prior to her death; the second in line, if there is no designated beneficiary, is the widow or widower of the employee; the third in line, if none of the <span id="Page_4209"></span>above, is the child or children of the employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8434(d). There is no evidence in the record that Laurel Press designated a beneficiary to receive her FERS credit and so, under the statutory order of precedence, Mr. Press, as widower, would receive the lump-sum credit in precedence to her children. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(d). The appellant necessarily argues that Mr. Press' waiver of "all of [his] rights to all such survivor benefits," in the Marital Settlement Agreement should act as a waiver of both his annuity rights and his right to the lump-sum credit. However, the waiver provision of FERS, upon which the appellant's argument relies, speaks only of "an individual entitled to an <span class="Italic">annuity,"</span> who may decline "all or any part of the amount of the <span class="Italic">annuity."</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465(a) (emphasis added). There is no statutory or regulatory provision for the waiver of entitlement to a lump-sum credit. Even if Mr. Press, as widower, had signed and filed with OPM an irrevocable waiver of his right to a survivor annuity, which he has not, he cannot waive his right to lump-sum benefits and his place in the order of precedence under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A lump sum payment is appropriate only if there is no survivor who is entitled to monthly survivor annuity benefits on the death of the former employee, <span class="Italic">McDaniel v. OPM</span>, 123 MSPR 55, 57-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2015 MSPB 61 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), she is entitled to a lump-sum payment based upon her father's Federal service because she was his designated beneficiary. It is true that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), designated beneficiaries come first in the order of precedence for receipt of a lump sum. However, a lump-sum benefit from the Retirement Fund is payable to the survivor(s) in the order of precedence described in section 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c) only if "there is no survivor who is entitled to monthly survivor annuity benefits on the death of [the] former employee." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2003(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(d)-(e). If an employee dies after retiring under CSRS and is survived by a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee, that surviving child is entitled to a survivor annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2). There is no dispute that: (1) the appellant's father died after his retirement from Federal service under CSRS; and (2) he is the father of a child whose still-living mother is his former spouse. Accordingly, we agree with the findings of OPM and the administrative judge that no lump-sum credit is currently payable to the appellant because B.P. is a survivor who became entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2) to monthly survivor annuity benefits upon the death of their father.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;B.P. is currently under 18 years of age and she could remain entitled to the annuity benefits until age 22, and possibly longer. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4). If all annuity rights have terminated before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit in the Retirement Fund based upon the appellant's father's Federal service, then it appears that the appellant could receive a lump-sum payment of the remaining balance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's contention that B.P. is receiving death benefits pursuant to section 12, subsection (c)(3) of the Act, rather than a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2), we agree with the administrative judge's finding that there is no such evidence in the record. However, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant is correct, her argument still must fail. As an initial matter, the section of the Act on which the appellant relies specifies that before a lump-sum payment is payable, "the right of all persons entitled to an annuity...shall terminate." An Act to Amend the Civil Service Retirement Act of May 29, 1930, Pub. L. No. 426, &#x00A7; 12(e)(2), 62 Stat. 48, 56 (1948). This condition has not been met here. Indeed, the appellant explicitly claims that B.P. "is entitled to receive an annuity under the Act." Further, regardless of whether B.P. actually has received a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2), she nonetheless is <span class="Italic">entitled</span> to receive it, which is all that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2003(a) requires.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Worley v. OPM</span>, 86 MSPR 237, 238-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 6-16 (2000) (overruled in part, <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, 120 MSPR 440, 2013 MSPB 95 (2013)), determined that a spouse may waive a survivor annuity to receive a lump sum payment that, in the spouse's judgment, would be financially advantageous:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When he applied for an immediate annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) on August 7, 1998, the appellant's husband, John M. Worley, elected a reduced annuity with a partial survivor benefit for the appellant, rather than a reduced annuity with the maximum survivor benefit. The appellant signed a consent form agreeing to a partial survivor annuity.<span class="Italic"></span> In an undated award letter to Mr. Worley, OPM informed him that the monthly rate of the reduced survivor annuity was $165.00, and that his retirement contributions totaled $40,663.00.<span class="Italic"></span> On March 4, 1999, Mr. Worley died.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In letters to OPM dated March 15 and 30, 1999, the appellant said that she did not want to receive a monthly survivor benefit in the then-current amount of $166.00 per month, but instead wanted OPM to issue a lump-sum payment of her late husband's unpaid retirement contributions. In a May 3, 1999 initial decision, OPM denied her request, stating that there was "no provision of the Civil Service Retirement law that would allow [it] to pay the lump-sum instead of the survivor annuity."<span class="Italic"></span> OPM's reconsideration decision was to the same effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the Board, the appellant argued, as she did before OPM, that if she received the reduced survivor benefit at the rate of $166.00 per month, it would take approximately 16 1/2 years of annuity payments to equal the amount of Mr. Worley's unpaid retirement contributions. She contended that Mr. Worley "would not have wanted her to suffer financially after his death," and that if she should die before the total annuity paid equals those contributions, her children would receive the lump-sum payment. She asked why her children should receive a lump-sum benefit that she herself could not receive even if she wanted to terminate her annuity, and she opined that such a result is "not fair," particularly since she needs the money now....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(d), a lump-sum benefit is to be paid, based on the service of a deceased employee, if that service does not entitle anyone to a survivor annuity at the time of the decedent's death, or if, before a claim for a survivor annuity is filed, the survivor's right to the annuity has terminated. A lump-sum benefit, consisting of the amount of retirement contributions still held by OPM, is also payable when, as here, an annuitant dies. <span class="Italic">See Wooten v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 MSPR 113 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2 and 9 (2000) (the Board remanded the appeal for findings on the correct disposition of the lump-sum payment due at the death of the annuitant).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8342(d) of Title 5 provides that a lump-sum credit shall be paid if the "right of all survivors terminates before a claim for survivor annuity is filed." [Emphasis added] . Thus, if the appellant's right to a survivor annuity terminated before she filed a claim for the annuity, a lump-sum payment can be made since there is no claim or evidence that anyone else is entitled to a monthly survivor annuity based on Mr. Worley's service. OPM, however, determined that a lump-sum benefit is not payable because the appellant is entitled to a monthly survivor annuity, and eligibility for a monthly annuity takes precedence over payment of a lump-sum. Although OPM has not expressly so argued, implicit in its decision to deny the appellant's request for a lump-sum payment is the assumption that she may not terminate her right to a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 633, 637-38 (1997), the Board held that a person entitled to a monthly survivor annuity may not terminate that right in order to cause a lump-sum payment to be made, but that decision was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, No. 98-3053 (Fed. Cir. May 12, 1998) (Table). The court's decision was unpublished and is therefore not citable as precedent under the court's rules. However, we find the court's reasoning persuasive, and we adopt it, as follows and with additional analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in the retirement statute, and OPM has cited no statutory provision, that limits terminating events in the case of a survivor benefit to either the remarriage or death of the person entitled to the survivor annuity. The court, in its unpublished decision in <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram</span>, noted that, on the contrary, there was much in the CSRS statute to suggest that termination of a survivor benefit can occur under circumstances other than remarriage or death. For example, the provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(g) regarding annuity accrued and unpaid at the "termination" of a survivor benefit does not limit the term "termination."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant has the right, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d), to decline to accept all or any part of the annuity by a waiver signed and filed with OPM. Although section 8345(d) states that a waiver "may be revoked at any time" (our emphasis), it does not preclude an irrevocable waiver that would terminate rights to a survivor annuity before a claim for such annuity is made. <span class="Italic">Accord Andersen Consulting v. United States</span>, 959 F.2d 929, 932 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (use of the permissive "may" in a statute authorizes discretion). Indeed, the statute contains no provision suggesting that the waiver specifically provided for in section 5 8345(d) is not effective, if so intended, to irrevocably terminate the right to a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the beginning of her dealings with OPM after the death of her husband, the appellant has expressed her desire to irrevocably waive her entitlement to a survivor benefit, rather than file a claim for a survivor annuity. As discussed above, within days of her husband's death, the appellant sent letters to OPM expressing her wish not to receive a monthly survivor benefit in the then-current amount of $166.00 per month, and asking OPM to issue a lump-sum payment of her late husband's unpaid retirement contributions. The provisions of section 8342(d) therefore were met and the lump-sum should have been paid, but for OPM's refusal to allow the appellant to terminate her right to a survivor annuity before she filed a claim for such benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that if the appellant files a waiver with OPM expressly stating that it is irrevocable and that it is retroactive to the date of Mr. Worley's death, then she would have terminated her rights to a survivor benefit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(d) so as to allow a lump-sum benefit to be payable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c). Neither OPM nor the administrative judge cited any statutory provision or case law that prevents the appellant from irrevocably waiving her right to a survivor annuity before she files a claim for a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4210"></span>In its reconsideration decision, OPM relied solely on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a). That provision states that an employee who is separated from federal service is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit of his retirement contributions, and that, if he is paid the credit, he will void any right to a retirement annuity which he might otherwise have, unless he becomes reemployed in a position covered by the CSRS and redeposits the amount of the lump-sum payment plus interest. <span class="Italic">See Broad v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 575, 576 (1992). This statutory provision is clearly inapplicable to the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Canelo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 217 (1993), as the only support for his finding that the appellant could not irrevocably waive her right to a survivor benefit. Waiver of a survivor annuity was not an issue in that case. Indeed, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Canelo</span> that no one was entitled to a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 223. That case therefore does not support a finding contrary to the one reached here. Rather, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Evans v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 94 (1993), is in accord with our holding in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, the Board discussed the legislative history and purpose of section 8345(d), and found that it should be construed to permit waivers of annuities for limited, and presumably, legitimate reasons. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 101 and 104. For example, the Board stated that a civil service annuity may be waived to permit continued receipt of another retirement benefit, that is, where the annuitant would be financially better off because of the waiver. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 101. The Board allowed that waivers may also be effected for "certain other similar purposes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find that the appellant has shown a purpose for her waiver request that falls within the provisions of section 8345(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ORDER</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant shall be permitted to file a properly executed waiver with OPM terminating her survivor annuity. For a lump-sum benefit to be payable, the waiver must be irrevocable and made retroactive to the date of Mr. Worley's death. If the appropriate waiver is received, we order OPM to accept it and to award a lump-sum benefit as provided by statute, less the amount already paid to the appellant in survivor benefits.*...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Section 8342(e) of Title 5 states that "[i]f all annuity rights...based on the service of a deceased employee or Member terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid [in a lump-sum]." The appellant sought to waive her survivor annuity before she filed a claim for it. Moreover, OPM averred below, the administrative judge found, and it is uncontested on petition for review that the appellant would receive the lump-sum benefit under the statutory order of preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In view of the appellant's waiver request and this Order and upon reconsideration of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram</span>, all of the annuity payments made thus far to the appellant constitute an overpayment. Rather than have OPM request the return of those payments before issuing a lump-sum benefit, it would seem practical and efficient for OPM to merely deduct the annuity payments from any lump-sum benefit due to the appellant and send her the difference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The approach in <span class="Italic">Worley</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Lubag v. OPM</span>, 88 MSPR 484, 487-88 &#x00B6; 8 (2001), permitting the widow to waive a small, reduced survivor annuity that she and her husband earlier elected and instead receive a more advantageous lump-sum death benefit that the annuitant, distracted by medical problems, probably would have chosen given his poor health and his interest in providing for his wife.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Requisite service requirements to qualify for lump sum benefits under FERS were described by <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 357, 359 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 872 F.2d 401 (Fed. Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant part of the FERS statute governing lump-sum death benefits provides that a widow or widower is entitled to such benefits "[i]f an employee...dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under section 8411 and is survived by a widow...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1). The record reflects that the appellant's husband had only seventeen months and seventeen days of civilian service with the federal government at the time of his death. There is no evidence to show that the decedent had ever held another civilian job with the federal government that could also be counted as creditable civilian service. The decedent's years of <span class="Italic">military</span> service performed between 1950 and 1952, while allowable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411 as creditable federal service toward a future retirement annuity or a survivor annuity, cannot be considered as the necessary <span class="Italic">civilian</span> service that is required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1) before a widow is entitled to lump-sum death benefits under that section. The appellant therefore is not entitled to FERS death benefits.</p>
