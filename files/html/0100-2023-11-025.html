<h2 class="h2" id="sec3-26"><span class="space">IV.</span> OFFICIAL TIME</h2>
<p class="noindent">Traditionally low dues structures and voluntary membership in federal-sector unions result in considerable reliance by unions on voluntary efforts of unit employees, rather than paid business agents, to represent unions in contract negotiation and grievance proceedings. The willingness of employees to undertake representational responsibilities in lieu of their regularly assigned duties is enhanced through the statutory provision of official time permitting employees to engage in negotiations and representation on the clock. The official time privilege is of inestimable importance to unions; it results in considerable cost to the government; it has been the subject of a lot of litigation. President Trump's now-revoked Executive Order 13,837 (May 2018), discussed below, sought to restrict use of official time. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-11-026.html#sec3-27">Executive Order 13,837</a>"; to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-065.html#sec5-66">Official Time</a>"; Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-664.html#sec6-665">Appraisal of Union Officials on Official Time</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-14-697.html#sec6-698">Official Time Use</a>"; and Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-182.html#sec8-182">Policing Official Time</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-16-183.html#sec8-183">Balancing Official Time and Work Needs</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-16-345.html#sec8-345">Denial of Official Time, Representation, Travel and Per Diem, or Benefits</a>"; review the OPM report, "Labor-Management Relations in the Executive Branch" (2014), <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/labor-management-relations/reports/labor-management-relations-in-the-executive-branch-2014.pdf">www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/labor-management-relations/reports/labor-management-relations-in-the-executive-branch-2014.pdf</a>.] Executive Orders 13,837, 13,839, and 13,836 were revoked by President Biden's Executive Order 14,003, of January 22, 2021. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-01-27/pdf/2021-01924.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-01-27/pdf/2021-01924.pdf</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Official time may be secured through both statute and contract. 5 USC 7131 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Official Time</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Any employee representing an exclusive representative in the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement under this [Statute] shall be authorized official time for such purposes, including attendance at impasse proceeding[s], during the time the employee otherwise would be in a duty status. The number of employees for whom official time is authorized under this subsection shall not exceed the number of individuals designated as representing the agency for such purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Any activities performed by any employee relating to the internal business of a labor organization (including the solicitation of membership, elections of labor organization officials, and collection of dues) shall be performed during the time the employee is in a nonduty status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Authority shall determine whether any employee participating for, or on behalf of, a labor organization in any phase of proceedings before the Authority shall be authorized official time for such purpose during the time the employee otherwise would be in a duty status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Except as provided in the preceding subsections of this section--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;any employee representing an exclusive representative, or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;in connection with any other matter covered by this chapter, any employee in an appropriate unit represented by an exclusive representative,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Statute provides two sources of official time. Official time for both collective bargaining and FLRA-related activities is provided as a statutory right. Official time for other purposes is to be negotiated. It is not a basis for refusing to negotiate official time that the use of the time is not strictly related to labor-management relations. Reviewing an arbitrator's award involving a grievance over official time, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals and Dept. of Labor, MSHA, Denver</span>, 39 FLRA 546, 553 (1991), declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ection 7131(d) does not preclude parties to a collective bargaining agreement from agreeing to provide official time for other matters; that is, matters other than those relating to labor-management relations activities. In other words, section 7131(d) affirmatively permits the negotiation of official time for labor-management relations activities; it does not preclude parties from agreeing to provide for official (paid) time in other circumstances unrelated to labor-management relations activities, provided that the granting of official time in those other circumstances is otherwise consistent with the Statute and other applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Official time may be granted for a variety of matters.&#x2003;For example, official time may be granted to employees to attend hearings before the EEOC and to respond to requests for discovery made in accordance with MSPB discovery procedures....&#8197;Consistent with an agency's broad discretion to grant paid time in a variety of circumstances, parties may agree in their collective bargaining agreements to provide official time for other matters. In such circumstances, an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement provision dealing with official time will not be found deficient under the Statute unless the award is contrary to law, rule, or regulation or other grounds stated in section 7122 of the Statute. To the extent that earlier Authority decisions suggest that all collective bargaining agreement provisions dealing with official time must relate solely to labor-management relations activities, they will no longer be followed. Of course, any provisions dealing with official time for labor-management relations activities must be consistent with section 7131 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he parties' collective bargaining provision in this case authorizes a unit employee to use "a reasonable amount of official time to attend meetings with management and third party proceedings when he/she is the affected employee or witness in a grievance, or statutory appeal proceeding." As is clear from the Arbitrator's award, the Arbitrator interpreted the provision as granting official time under certain specified conditions, not restricted solely to labor-management relations activities. As so interpreted, section 7131(d) of the Statute does not apply. The Agency cites no law, rule, or regulation with which the Arbitrator's award is inconsistent. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's contention that the award is inconsistent with section 7131(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we reject the Agency's argument that, pursuant to section 7103(a)(14)(C) of the Statute, the grievance could not be appealed through the <span id="Page_254"></span>grievance procedure because Federal employees' compensation was a matter "specifically provided for" by statute. As the Arbitrator correctly noted, the issue presented by the grievance was not the rejection of the grievant's appeal by OWCP, but rather the Agency's rejection of the grievant's request that he be allowed official time and travel to attend the OWCP hearing on his appeal of the OWCP decision....&#8197;The section cited by the Agency, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8124, does not address the matter of official time for the grievant's attendance at the OWCP appeal hearing so as to exclude that matter from the definition of "conditions of employment."</p>

In one arbitration case, FLRA concluded that official time may be required for both union representatives and employees who, having no particular representational status, are engaged in a statutorily covered activity.

<p class="noindent">Over time, FLRA case law on the justification for negotiated official time developed from an absolute right, to a negotiable topic, to a necessary exception to the right of management to assign work, to an appropriate arrangements analysis, and back to an exception to the right of management to assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 45 FLRA 339, 346-55 (1992) (Provisions 2 and 6) [discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-057.html#sec5-58">Appropriate Arrangements</a>"].</p>
<p class="noindent">At the end of 2020, FLRA decided that official time would not be treated as an exception ("carve out") to the right of management to assign work; instead, it would be treated under an "excessive interference test" applicable to other proposals infringing management rights under 5 USC 7106.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we reexamine Authority precedent related to the carve-out doctrine and find that &#x00A7; 7131(d) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute)[1] is not an exception to management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.[2]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Michael G. Whelan issued an award finding that the Union's grievance was arbitrable and that the Agency violated the parties' collective-bargaining agreement by denying a portion of an official-time request. The Agency filed exceptions to the award, arguing that it fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement and that it is contrary to law because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a). For the reasons set forth below, we deny these exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union president (the grievant) requested official time to prepare for upcoming arbitrations. Upon receipt of the request, the Agency sought additional information, which the grievant provided. After the Agency denied half of the requested time without explanation, the grievant renewed his request for the full amount with additional information as to why he needed that time. The Agency did not respond.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by partially denying the official-time request. The Agency did not respond to the grievance, and the Union invoked arbitration. In the absence of a stipulated issue, the Arbitrator framed the issues to be resolved, in relevant part, as (1) whether the grievance was arbitrable, and (2) whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement by denying part of the grievant's official-time request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At arbitration, the Agency argued that the grievance was not arbitrable because the Union did not meet the informal resolution requirements of Article 31, Section b of the parties' agreement (Article 31). The Arbitrator found Article 31's requirement that the parties "always attempt informal resolution at the lowest appropriate level" was "ambiguous" and did not set forth a specific process for informal resolution. He further found that the grievant's attempts at informal resolution--including a memorandum to, and an in-person meeting with, Agency officials--"met any requirement in Article 31." Alternatively, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency waived its arbitrability argument by failing to "respond to the grievance and put the Union on notice of its arbitrability defense." Consequently, the Arbitrator held that the grievance was arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the merits of the grievance, the Arbitrator found that Article 11 of the parties' agreement (Article 11) allows the Union a "reasonable" amount of <span id="Page_255"></span>official time and that Article 7 of the parties agreement (Article 7) set out the "procedures for [its] approval." However, because Article 11 did not specify who should determine what constitutes a reasonable amount of official time, the Arbitrator determined that the parties must attempt to agree on the amount. The Arbitrator noted that this process is not "formal," and that an "agreement is recognized when...the Union acquiesces to the Agency's decision." Relying on recent Authority guidance on the importance of informed decision-making in <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP</span> (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>),[10] the Arbitrator observed that official-time requests need to "provide sufficient information to educate the Agency as to [its] reasonableness." He further found that the Agency could not "simply deny an official[-]time request without considering" its reasonableness and, to "facilitate [an] agreement," an exchange of information was necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;71 FLRA 119 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the information provided by the parties at the time of the request, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's official-time request was reasonable and that the Agency had not presented any evidence to the contrary. On this point, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had waived arguments in support of its denial by failing to provide them to the Union contemporaneously. Accordingly, because the Arbitrator found that the Agency had violated Articles 7 and 11, he sustained the grievance as it related to the grievant's official-time request and granted the grievant backpay of one hour and fifty minutes for the time he spent on representational activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. As relevant here, an agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom, or what positions, the duties will be assigned.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency requests that the Authority reexamine the carve-out doctrine[30]--a statutory interpretation that carves out &#x00A7; 7131(d) as an exception to the management rights in &#x00A7; 7106.[31] Section 7131(d) of the Statute states that "any employee representing [a union]...shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the [union] involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest."[32]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30] Exceptions Br. at 23. The Union argues that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4 and 2429.5 bar these arguments because the Agency did not raise them before the Arbitrator. However, the Agency did raise a management&#8209;rights argument below. We also note that a request to reconsider Authority precedent is not within an arbitrator's authority and, thus, would not have properly been before the Arbitrator here. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(1) (charging Authority with the responsibility to "establish[&#8197;] policies and guidance" relating to the Statute); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Energy v.

<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority's precedent concerning the carve-out doctrine has been inconsistent, and is contrary to the plain wording of the Statute, we agree that such a review is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The carve-out doctrine originated in <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Council of Locals No. 214 v. FLRA</span>[33] (<span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>), which considered whether a proposal concerning official time for representational activities impermissibly interfered with management's &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) right to <span class="Italic">elect</span> to negotiate over the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty."[34] Applying a "direct effects test,"[35] the Authority held that "where [an] agency can show...that the use of official time will interfere with the accomplishment of the agency's work, the exercise of management's rights will take precedence."[36] On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected this holding. It noted that there were "ambiguities" between &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106 and 7131, but found that the Authority's statutory interpretation would "effective[ly] repeal" &#x00A7; 7131(d) because it would "always make official[-]time proposals negotiable only at the agency's election" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).[37] The court further stated that "[u]nless [&#x00A7;] 7131(d) carves out an exception..., [&#x00A7;] 7106(a) would [also] preclude any negotiation of official time provisions, since official time always affects an agency's ability to assign work."[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[38] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1530 n.8. <span class="Italic">AFGE v.

The Authority's underlying decision held that any time an official&#8209;time proposal has a "direct effect" on staffing patterns, it falls within &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and the agency has no duty to bargain over it if it does not wish to do so. <span class="Italic">Local 214</span>, 19 FLRA at 222-223. The D.C.

Nor did <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span> consider whether application of an "excessive interference" test, the test we adopt today, is consistent with &#x00A7; 7131(d). It is important to note that an "appropriate arrangement" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is a mandatory subject of bargaining, notwithstanding &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Ky.

Thus, contrary to the dissent's contentions, our decision today does not effectively "void" &#x00A7; 7131(d), nor does our decision contravene the reasoning of <span class="Italic">AFGE v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority adopted this statutory interpretation in <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station, Los Angeles, California</span>, finding that an agency committed an unfair labor practice by failing to negotiate before changing the official-time schedule.[39] In rejecting an argument "based on management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)," the Authority held that &#x00A7; 7131(d) "'carves out an exception'" to management's right to assign work because, "otherwise, that right 'would preclude any negotiation of official[-]time provisions.'"[40] The Authority went on to announce that "the use of official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d)--that is, its amount, allocation and scheduling--is negotiable absent an emergency or other special circumstances."[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For several years, the Authority continued to both apply the carve-out doctrine <span class="Italic">and</span> consider whether provisions concerning official time impermissibly interfered with &#x00A7; 7106--in one case, going so far as to conclude, incongruously, that two such provisions did not constitute appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) but were negotiable under carve-out doctrine.[53] Then, without directly overturning <span class="Italic">BATF</span> or providing an explanation, the Authority changed course and stopped considering whether a proposal, provision, or award impermissibly interfered with management rights when official time was involved.[54] In negotiability cases, the Authority considered only whether "emergency or other special circumstances" intervened to render an official time proposal nonnegotiable.[55] Similarly, in the arbitration context, the Authority found that awards upholding official time negotiated under &#x00A7; 7131(d) were not subject to exceptions concerning management's right to assign work.[56] Throughout this time, some Authority members questioned the viability and necessity of the carve-out exception.[57]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In light of the foregoing inconsistencies, we believe it is necessary to bring clarity to Authority precedent by giving meaning to the plain wording of the Statute.

Contrary to the fear expressed in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, giving proper effect to &#x00A7; 7106(a) does not "effectively void" &#x00A7; 7131(d) any more than it does other statutory union rights that potentially impact management rights.[59] This is because of the balance that the courts and the Authority have established between the exercise of management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) and appropriate arrangements protecting union rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).[60] Reading the Statute in this way "effectuates rather than frustrates the major purpose of the legislative draft[ers],"[61] by accommodating <span class="Italic">both</span> the agency and union interests concerning the use of official time.[62] As it is not necessary to carve &#x00A7; 7131(d) out of &#x00A7; 7106(a) to give it effect, the Authority will no longer apply the carve-out doctrine. Where it is asserted that matters concerning the amount, allocation, or scheduling of official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d) affect a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), we will consider whether the proposal, provision, or award excessively interferes with that right.[63]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this decision, we note that the carve-out doctrine arose from the concern that, if &#x00A7; 7131(d) is subject to &#x00A7; 7106, the availability of official time would be greatly reduced or eliminated.[66] We believe that these concerns are unfounded.[67] Arbitrators' awards that find violations of official-time provisions are not contrary to law simply because they "affect" a &#x00A7; 7106 management right.[68] Such an award is contrary to law only if, as relevant here, it "excessively interferes" with the purported management right.[69] Similarly, in the context of a negotiability case, an official-time proposal or provision that affects a &#x00A7; 7106 right would still be negotiable if it were found to be a procedure or an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or (3), respectively.[70] Many official-time awards, proposals, and provisions will continue to be lawful. Even in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, where the Authority asserted that the carve-out doctrine was <span class="Italic">required</span> to protect official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d), the official-time provisions at issue were found negotiable as "appropriate arrangements" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).[71]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the case at hand, the Agency argues that the award excessively interferes with the management right to assign work by requiring it to engage in an "interactive process" when responding to official-time requests. Therefore, it contends that the award should be vacated under the <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP</span> (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>) three-part framework for analyzing whether an award excessively interferes with a management right.[73]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[73] <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405-06.

Logistics Agency</span>, 70 FLRA 932, 933 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting). Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had improperly denied the grievant a particular amount of official time. Whenever a proposal, provision, or award concerns the amount, allocation, or scheduling of official time for representational duties, it affects the right to assign work because it "necessarily reduces the number of person-hours available for performing the work of the agency." <span class="Italic">AFGE v.

Therefore, <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> applies in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, the first question is whether the Arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision.[74] Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Articles 7 and 11 by partially denying the grievant's official-time request.

<p class="noindent-2">[74] <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation.[76] As conceded by the Agency, the Arbitrator's remedy--backpay of one hour and fifty minutes for the off-duty time spent to perform representational tasks--does "reasonably and proportionally" relate to the violation.[79]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The final question is whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement excessively interferes with the &#x00A7; 7106(a) right to assign work.[80] We find that answer to this question is no. We note, initially, that the award does not direct any prospective action by the Agency when dealing with official-time requests.[81] Further, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement, as involving the exchange of information to determine whether an official-time request is "reasonable," is consistent with <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, which emphasizes the necessity of sharing information to "make a reasoned determination" about such requests.[82] Moreover, the award does not explicitly impose conditions on the Agency's ability to make work assignments.[83] For these reasons, we find that the award does not excessively interfere with the right to assign work, and we deny this contrary-to-law exception.</p>

The negotiability analysis does not depend on establishment of an appropriate arrangement; instead, 5 USC 7131(d) "carved out" an exception to 5 USC 7106. At issue were Provisions 8 and 9:</p>

<p class="noindent">The proposals were negotiable, but not as appropriate arrangements, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 49 FLRA at 205-07:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These provisions are similar to Provision 6 in <span class="Italic">Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Alcohol, Tobacco and</span> <span class="Italic">Firearms</span>, 45 FLRA at 344-55, in that these provisions place restrictions on the Agency's ability to deny a request that a Union representative be excused from performing assigned duties in order to perform representational activities on official time. In <span class="Italic">Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Alcohol, Tobacco and</span> <span class="Italic">Firearms</span>, we reviewed our approach to the relationship between section 7131(d) of the Statute, which authorizes the negotiation of official time, and section 7106, which concerns management rights, in view of the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> [110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to <span class="Italic">Bureau</span> <span class="Italic">of Alcohol, Tobacco and</span> <span class="Italic">Firearms</span>, the Authority held that section 7131(d) of the Statute carved out an exception to section 7106(a) and that "the use of official time under section 7131(d)--that is, its amount, allocation and scheduling--is negotiable absent an emergency or other special circumstances...." <span class="Italic">Military Entrance</span> <span class="Italic">Processing Station, Los Angeles, California</span>, 25 FLRA 685, 689 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station</span>). In reviewing the approach that was adopted in <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing</span> <span class="Italic">Station</span>, we stated in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">In our view, Congress intended by section 7131(d) of the Statute to authorize unions to negotiate over the use of official time for representational activity. However, the breadth and effect that the Court has ascribed to the phrase "nothing in this chapter," which appears in section 7106(a) of the Statute, requires us to reconsider our previous conclusion that section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">45 FLRA at 347-48.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognized that a "strict reading" of <span class="Italic">IRS</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span> would lead to a conclusion that any proposals concerning official time that are negotiated under section 7131(d) are subject to section 7106(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 348. In determining whether to adopt this approach in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco</span> <span class="Italic">and Firearms</span>, we expressed our concern that subordinating section 7131(d) to section 7106(a) of the Statute would effectively void section 7131(d). We noted the elementary rule of statutory construction that effect must be given to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute so that no part is "rendered inoperative or insignificant<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 348. In view of the need to give effect to all provisions of the Statute, we stated that we read <span class="Italic">IRS</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span> to apply to situations where according predominance to the rights established by section 7106 could be achieved without eviscerating another provision of the Statute as was the case in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>. Because sections 7106 and 7131(d) of the Statute could not be reconciled in a manner that continued to give effect to section 7131(d), we stated that we would continue to carve out an exception to section 7106 of the Statute "in order to maintain the negotiability, where otherwise warranted, of matters involving official time<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Provisions 8 and 9 concern the use of official time, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and</span> <span class="Italic">Firearms</span>, that these provisions fall within the exception to section 7106(a)(2)(B) that is provided under section 7131(d) for matters pertaining to official time for union representational activities. We conclude, therefore, based on <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span>, that these provisions are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an alternative to finding Provision 6 negotiable based on application of the theory discussed above, the majority in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span> (Member Armendariz concurring in part and dissenting in part) also analyzed that provision to determine whether it constituted an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute by applying the analytical framework that was set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>. In applying that analytical framework in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and</span> <span class="Italic">Firearms</span>, we concluded that Provision 6 constituted an arrangement even though the provision could have required the granting of official time in circumstances where the need to engage in representational activity was not attributable to the exercise of a management right. 45 FLRA at 352. In view of the growing body of court precedent regarding the extent to which proposals that apply broadly to employees may constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute as we discussed in conjunction with Provisions 1 and 2 above, we reevaluate this approach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that in order for a proposal to constitute an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, it must address adverse effects that may be produced by an exercise of management's rights. We also recognize that not all representational activities for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d) of the Statute will be related to the exercise of a management right. For example, we recently concluded that representing Federal employees by visiting, phoning, and writing to elected representatives in support or opposition to pending or desired legislation that would impact the working conditions of employees constitutes a representational activity for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Atlanta, Georgia</span>, 47 FLRA at 1118. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also National Federation of Federal <span id="Page_258"></span>Employees, Local 2050 and</span> <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 45 FLRA 289, 294-98 (1992) (responding to parties, including journalistic media and members of the general public, who make inquiries of the union about issues affecting the terms and conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees constitutes representational activity for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d)). On further consideration, we conclude that we will no longer analyze as arrangements proposals that extend to circumstances in which the need to engage in representational activity for which the official time is sought is not related to the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Provisions 8 and 9 are negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. These two provisions are not limited to requiring the release of Union representatives from their assigned duties to perform representational activity relating to the exercise of a management right but apply broadly to all representational activities including such possible pursuits as lobbying elected representatives. We conclude that Provisions 8 and 9 do not constitute arrangements within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute because they are not limited to addressing harms suffered as a result of an exercise of management's rights. Nevertheless, based on our conclusion that section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106, they are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reiterated the "carve-out" exception for official time in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1281-88 (1997), while affirming the negotiability of a provision (Article 16, &#x00A7; 9) seeking agreement by management that union representatives be permitted to take official time by leaving a note on their supervisors' desks stating "where they are and approximately how long they will be gone":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This provision permits Union representatives who are conducting official Union business to notify their supervisors, by written note, regarding their location and the expected length of their absence. As such, this provision concerns the scheduling of official time by Union representatives. The provision also permits supervisors to authorize a different time during which Union representatives may conduct official Union business in cases where the "presence" of the representative would cause "substantial disruption." The Union explains that the term substantial disruption is intended to refer to disruption that could occur at the representative's work station, rather than at the work station of the employee with whom the representative is dealing. As such, we construe the provision to mean that the union representative's supervisor may authorize an alternate time for the use of official time when the representative's absence would cause a substantial disruption.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As this provision concerns the scheduling of official time, its disposition involves an analysis of section 7131(d) of the Statute and the scope of the "carve-out" exception to management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, the Authority had occasion to address the application of this exception to a claim that an arbitration award relating to official time matters was contrary to sections 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service and American Federation of Government Employees (Worldwide Consolidated Bargaining Unit</span>), 51 FLRA 1371 (1996) (Chair Segal dissenting in relevant part), a majority of the Authority adhered to the view that section 7131(d) carves out an exception to various management rights, absent emergency or other special circumstances. This conclusion was based on Authority precedent in such cases as <span class="Italic">BATF </span>and <span class="Italic">Military</span> <span class="Italic">Entrance Processing Station, Los Angeles, California</span>, 25 FLRA 685 (1987) (<span class="Italic">MEPS</span>), and relevant judicial opinions. The majority also stated that "the reference in section 7131(d) to the granting of official time 'in any amount'...encompasses the allocation and scheduling of official time<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1374-75.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency urges the Authority to adopt what is essentially a restrictive interpretation of section 7131(d). Although the Agency does not dispute that section 7131(d) authorizes negotiations over the "amount" of official time, it argues that section 7131(d) limits negotiations to that matter. We reject these arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7131(d) states that official time "shall be granted" in the amount that the parties agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. Thus, section 7131(d) mandates that agencies "give," "bestow," or "confer" official time to the exclusive representatives of their employees for representational matters. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Webster's Third New International Dictionary</span> (1986) (unabridged)....&#8197;By using the term "shall" and thereby making the grant of official time mandatory, it is clear to us that Congress intended for representatives of labor organizations to be able to use and schedule that time in a meaningful way. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 798 F.2d at 1530-31, n.8 ("[u]nless section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106(a), section 7106(a) would preclude any negotiation of official time provisions, since official time always affects an agency's ability to assign work."). The clear import of the Agency's argument is that it does not wish to bargain over the allocation or scheduling of official time by Union representatives. However, we interpret section 7131(d) to mean that management cannot unilaterally determine the allocation or scheduling of official time. Rather, it must be determined bilaterally. We believe that reading the Statute in this manner gives full effect to a provision that was of obvious significance to its drafters<span class="Italic">. Cf. id.</span> at 1530 (the court cautioned that the Authority "cannot assume that Congress' explicit provision for official time was not meant to be a meaningful guarantee.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As is evident from various statements by the proponents of the proposed legislation that was ultimately enacted into law, Congress was concerned with two paramount and pragmatic principles in section 7131(d): (1) ensuring that representatives of labor organizations would have sufficient opportunity to perform the representational activities that were being provided by the proposed legislation; and (2) equalizing the resources and ability of labor organization representatives to pursue these activities on official time in the same manner as management. Consistent with congressional recognition that management can exercise control over the time it spends in representational activities, interpreting section 7106(a)(2) to permit management to control when union representatives can schedule or use official time would undercut the purpose of section 7131(d). Rather, we interpret section 7131(d) as requiring parties to negotiate over the scheduling of official time used by union representatives affords both sides an opportunity to determine the conditions under which employees will be able to use official time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress vested labor organizations that attain exclusive recognition status with significant rights and responsibilities. In order for labor organizations to fulfill their legislative mandate, Congress sought to ensure a balance between management representatives, who have duty time available for fulfilling their responsibilities under the Statute, and union representatives. Consistent with this intent, the Authority has found that the scheduling of official time is within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">E.g., PTO</span>, 49 FLRA at 203-07. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Avionics Center, Indianapolis, Indiana</span>, 36 FLRA 567 (1990) (respondent violated Statute by unilaterally changing practice of scheduling representational meetings on official time).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that excluding the scheduling of official time from matters that may be negotiated under section 7131(d), as the Agency suggests, would have serious consequences. Significantly, it would give agency management unilateral control over the scheduling of official time. For example, if negotiations under section 7131(d) were permitted over the number of hours to be spent on official time but not over the scheduling of that time, agency management could control when that time could be used. In such circumstances, if parties were to negotiate the use of 20 hours of official time per week and agency management could dictate when such time could be taken, management would in effect be able to determine who could use the time, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, effectively dictating the union's choice of representative. Moreover, under the Agency's construction of section 7131(d), we doubt whether a proposal for 100 percent official time for a union representative could <span class="Italic">ever </span>be negotiated, since that amount of time assumes that the union representative could freely schedule official time and determine the uses of that time. Yet, some parties in the Federal sector labor-management relations program may find that negotiating over, and agreeing to, the use of 100 percent official time for union representatives is appropriate for their circumstances. Indeed, the negotiability of proposals for the use of 100 percent of official time have been judicially sanctioned. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 798 F.2d at 1529.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the negotiability of official time under section 7131(d) is not without some limitation. Restrictions on the negotiability of such time are, first and foremost, imposed by the parties themselves, who are authorized to negotiate only an amount of time that is "reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d). Further, official time under section 7131(d) is negotiable "absent an emergency or other special circumstances."...&#8197;<span class="Italic">MEPS</span>, 25 FLRA at 689. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(D). Thus, management's interests in negotiating legitimate limits with respect to the scheduling of official time matters under section 7131(d) are protected by the language of that section as well as by section 7106(a)(2)(D)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency's interpretation of section 7131(d) would upset the balance of official time usage that Congress intended to create. We find it appropriate to apply the "carve-out" exception to find that Article 16, Section 9 does not affect management's rights to direct employees and assign work. Under these circumstances, there is no need to address the merits of the Union's contention that the provision is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we address the Agency's contention that, even assuming the applicability of <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, the provision here is distinguishable and should be found to interfere with the rights to direct employees and assign work. The provisions in that case set forth the circumstances under which employees and union representatives would be released from their duties for purposes of meeting with the union or performing representational functions. Those provisions also required that employees "request <span id="Page_259"></span>permission" from their supervisors and that union representatives "check" with their supervisors before being released from duty. 45 FLRA at 344, 345. Although such a requirement is not contained in Article 16, Section 9, its absence does not warrant the conclusion urged by the Agency. Because section 7131(d) carves out an exception to sections 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B), it permits negotiations over the scheduling of official time, including the ability to use official time without advance scheduling or permission from the supervisor, absent emergency situations or other special circumstances. We also reject the Agency's reliance on Provision 18 in <span class="Italic">POPA</span>. That provision related to employees advising their supervisors or designee of various matters prior to the employees' departure from their work areas. The Authority found that the provision directly interfered with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. The provision here is different in that it applies to Union representatives who would be on official time. Thus, the carve-out exception applies to defeat the management rights claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">Provisions were negotiable that prevented the employer from relying on the demands of ordinary workload to deny official time for representation functions to employees and union representatives. The ability to carry on those functions would be seriously eroded if ordinary workloads could block those representational activities through denials of official time. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2354 and Air Force 90th CSG, Warren AFB</span>, 30 FLRA 1130, 1134 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not preclude uses of official time by interposing an agency regulation (a Treasury General Counsel Directive) not supported by a compelling need. In <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 72-74 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1070 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (not considering issue of compelling need), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 45 FLRA 1256 (1992), FLRA considered to be unconvincing an agency position statement arguing that a proposal for official time for union representatives should be denied because the allocated time could be used by representatives taking adversarial positions against the agency in the course of personnel litigation. Activities supporting allowable official time could not be distinguished on the basis of the degree of conflict that might arise between the positions of agency and union representatives. FLRA explained as to Provision 19 in its 1991 decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether appearing before an arbitrator or an administrative law judge in an unfair labor practice proceeding to vindicate rights under a negotiated agreement or appearing before a hearing officer of the EEOC, the attorney representative is in an adversarial posture with regard to the enforcement of employee rights under either the contract or applicable law or regulation. To contend that one situation has conflict of interest implications while the other does not is unconvincing. Moreover, to assert that one adversarial situation adversely affects accomplishment of the Agency's mission or functions, while the other adversarial situation does not, is equally unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Statute expressly finds that the right of employees to "participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them" both "safeguards the public interest" and "contributes to effective conduct of public business[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(A) and (B)....&#8197;Congress has found that the Federal labor-management relations program is in the public interest and enhances conduct of public business. To implement that program, Congress has authorized employees to participate by, among other things, acting as union representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The congressional finding, that employee participation in union activities safeguards the public interest, contradicts the Agency position that participation of an Agency attorney as a designated Union representative in administrative proceedings impairs the public's confidence in the integrity of the Government and damages the attorney's ability to properly carry out the functions which he or she is employed to execute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Obstruction of statutory official time entitlement is an unfair labor practice. Interference occurred when management insisted that a negotiator attend negotiations on a leave status when she was clearly entitled to official time. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Space Div., Los Angeles and AFGE Local 2429</span>, 6 FLRA 439, 451 (1981) (ALJ Decision). The delay of a union's request for impact bargaining was not a defense to a charge that the union should have received official time for negotiations when the agency in fact entered into negotiations. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys. and Council of Prison Locals, AFGE</span>, 12 FLRA 9, 10-11 (1983). But an agency properly denied official time to a person designated as a union negotiator whose regularly assigned duties were performed under time constraints dictated by a congressional mandate. He was one of five designated members of the union team. It was not shown that he was essential to the functioning of the union team so that his absence required the union to discontinue negotiations or that the right to name another representative in his place was requested or denied. The right to choose employees as members of a union bargaining team is not absolute. <span class="Italic">Fed. R.R. Admin. and AFGE Local 2814</span>, 21 FLRA 508, 511 (1986). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-183.html#sec8-183">Balancing Official Time and Work Needs</a>," concerning the interrelationship between official time requirements and work requirements; decisions in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-182.html#sec8-182">Policing Official Time</a>," discuss obstruction of official time usage.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an agency may not restrict official time when it is available by statute or contract, the agency may prohibit use of official time for matters not required by statute or contract. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Drum and AFGE Local 400,</span> 64 FLRA 337, 339-40 (2009), union representatives were denied official time to pass out literature concerning the National Security Personnel System, with the purpose of soliciting comments on the evolving system. In the ensuing ULP case, FLRA concluded there was no violation by management's restriction on the use of official time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7131 of the Statute sets forth the rights and restrictions associated with the use of official time. Subsections (a) and (c) authorize union representative's official time for bargaining and certain Authority-related activities, and subsection (b) bars the use of official time for internal union matters. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(a)-(c). The use of official time for all other types of representational activities is subject to negotiation under subsection (d), which provides that union representatives in the bargaining unit "shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority, citing the legislative history of the Statute, has stated that, in addition to the amount of time, &#x00A7; 7131 (d) "makes <span class="Italic">all other matters</span> concerning official time for unit employees engaged in labor-management relations activity subject to negotiation...." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Hq. Air Force Materiel Command,</span> 49 FLRA 1111, 1119 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 59 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>Comm. on Post Office &#x0026; Civil Serv., House of Representatives, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute,</span> <span class="Italic">Title</span> <span class="Italic">VII</span> <span class="Italic">of</span> <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">Civil</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span> <span class="Italic">Reform</span> <span class="Italic">Act</span> <span class="Italic">of</span> <span class="Italic">1978</span> (Comm. Print No. 96-7), at 705 (1979)) (emphasis in <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>). Consequently, there is "no statutory entitlement to perform on official time representational duties of the type covered by [&#x00A7;] 7131(d) [of the Statute.]" <span class="Italic">Air Force,</span> 49 FLRA at 1120 (citation omitted). Rather, any entitlement to official time to engage in activities covered by &#x00A7; 1731(d) arises under a negotiated agreement, not the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Mine Warfare Eng'g Activity, Yorktown, Va.,</span> 39 FLRA 1207, 1213-14 (1991) (union entitlement to official time limited by terms of parties' agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right under &#x00A7; 7102 to "publicize matters affecting unit employees' terms and conditions of employment[,]" which includes distributing fliers, is an activity covered by &#x00A7; 7131(d). <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2050,</span> 45 FLRA at 297. <span class="Italic">See also, Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, III.,</span> 34 FLRA 1129, 1135 (1990) (flier distribution characterized as "publiciz[ing] matters affecting unit employees' terms and conditions of employment"). Thus, absent a collective bargaining agreement provision allowing such distribution on official time, the Charging Party does not have a right to use official time for this purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Judge did not find, and there is no indication, that the parties' agreement allows for distribution of union literature on official time. Therefore, there is no basis for finding that the Charging Party has a right to use official time to distribute fliers concerning NSPS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding a statutory right to distribute literature on official time, the Judge relied on <span class="Italic">ACT, Old Hickory,</span> 55 FLRA 811, and <span class="Italic">HUD,</span> 60 FLRA 311. As discussed below, the Judge's finding is not supported by these decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">ACT, Old Hickory,</span> the Authority considered the negotiability of a proposal to allow union representatives to lobby Congress--an activity protected by &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute--on official time. In finding that the proposal violated a federal statute restricting duty-time lobbying by Department of Defense employees, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Union essentially argues that there are only two categories of employee time: duty time and non-duty time. This is mistaken. Section 7131 of the Statute creates a distinct third category of time: official time, when an employee is performing representational functions for the union while receiving compensation from the agency. Unlike regular duty time, an employee's activities on official time are not directed by the agency. Unlike annual leave, an employee's activities on official time are restricted by the Statute. In this connection, we note <span class="Italic">that both official time and duty time--unlike non-duty time such as annual leave--"shall he considered hours of work.</span>" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.424(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). Although the Authority stated that official time is "distinct" from regular duty time, that does not support the Judge's conclusion that official time is "'non-work time" for purposes of exercising &#x00A7; 7102 rights. Nor does it support a conclusion that a union official has a statutory right to use official time to distribute literature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">HUD,</span> the Authority addressed whether representational duties performed on official time constitute "official agency duties." <span class="Italic">HUD,</span> 60 FLRA at 313. Based on precedent defining the term "work" in &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority found that representational duties are not agency-assigned for purposes of a telecommuting statute and, therefore, do not qualify employees for telecommuting. <span class="Italic">Id. Cf. Soc. Sec. Admin., Inland Empire Area,</span> 46 FLRA 161 (1992) (gain-sharing awards <span id="Page_260"></span>can be based on official time duties); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Fed. Union of Scientists &#x0026; Eng'rs, Local R1-144,</span>42 FLRA 1285 (1991) (performance awards cannot be based on official time duties); <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 65,</span> 25 FLRA 373 (1987) (official time can be used to earn credit time); <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 19 FLRA 43 (1985) (official time cannot be used to earn compensatory time); and <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Assoc.,</span> 21 FLRA 580 (1986) (official time cannot be used to earn overtime). The Judge did not explain, and the record does not disclose, how this fact establishes a statutory right to use official time to distribute literature. Thus, there is no basis for finding that <span class="Italic">HUD</span> supports the Judge's conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Judge erred in finding that the Charging Party had a statutory right to use official time to distribute literature and concluding that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by prohibiting such a use of official time.</p>
