<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained the award of an arbitrator who sustained a violation of 5 USC 7116(a)(1) when a supervisor refused to accept, purportedly for privacy reasons, a medical certificate from an employee that a union representative attempted to deliver to the supervisor, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-040.html">62 FLRA 153</a>, 153, 156-57 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beginning in March 2002, due to a medical condition, the affected employee began receiving a temporary reasonable accommodation that permitted her to work from home. The temporary reasonable accommodation was scheduled to end August 2, 2004. In April 2004, the affected employee began working with a new supervisor. In May 2004, the new supervisor notified the affected employee that she would have until August 2, 2004, to submit information about her medical condition directly from the doctor who examined her, or the reasonable accommodation would come to an end on that date. On August 6, 2004, the affected employee's Union representative attempted to hand-deliver the requested medical information to the affected employee's supervisor. The supervisor believed that the delivery of the medical certificate by a third party implicated the affected employee's privacy rights, and informed the Union representative that he would not accept the medical certificate. After refusing to accept the delivery of the medical information, the supervisor e-mailed the Union representative, and requested that any medical information submitted by the affected employee through the Union representative or any third party be accompanied by a valid signed waiver by the affected employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Arbitrator found that the Union representative was acting in his official capacity because the Union representative was attempting to assist the affected employee in meeting her requirements under the parties' collective bargaining agreement to submit medical documentation in support of sick leave requests. The Arbitrator also found that the supervisor "surely understood" and "knew" the purpose of the Union representative's action in attempting to deliver the medical certificate. The Arbitrator acknowledged testimony by the affected employee that the Union representative was acting as a "courier." However, the Arbitrator did not find this testimony dispositive, because in the Arbitrator's view, "a Union agent surely can discharge his representative responsibilities by serving as a messenger for a needy employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that the Union representative was not acting in his official capacity when delivering the medical information is based solely on the same testimony referenced by the Arbitrator--the affected employee's testimony that the Union representative was acting as a "courier." This argument ignores the Arbitrator's reasoning that the Union representative was attempting to assist the employee in complying with her responsibilities under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The Agency also overlooks that in the same testimony where the affected employee referred to the Union representative as a "courier," she also testified that the Union was engaged in ongoing attempts to represent her regarding her requested accommodation. In these circumstances, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is deficient because the Union representative was not acting in his official capacity when he attempted to deliver the medical documentation. <span class="Italic">See Local 2612</span>, 55 FLRA at 486 (union failed to demonstrate that award finding that an employee was not acting as a union representative was deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the supervisor prevented the Union representative from delivering medical documentation on behalf of the affected employee.&#x2003;Consistent with the foregoing discussion, the Union representative was exercising rights protected by the Statute when undertaking this activity. In this regard, &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise of any right provided by the Statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). Section 7102 of the Statute sets forth certain employee rights including the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal and that each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. Such right includes the right to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative. <span class="Italic">Congressional Research Employees Association, IFPTE, Local 75, </span>59 FLRA 994, 1001 (2004). Thus, by preventing the Union representative from delivering the medical documentation, the supervisor "interefere[d]" with the Union representative's right, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute, and the award finding a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) is not contrary to law.

That determination was affirmed, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Michigan Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 878 F.3d 171, 174-79 (6th Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arises from the Guard's decision to terminate two "dual-status" technicians. Under federal law, dual-status technicians occupy a "hybrid military-civilian position." <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Peters</span>, 249 F.3d 433, 438 (6th Cir. 2001). They are military employees in that they must be members of the National Guard, hold a military grade, and wear an appropriate military uniform while performing military duties. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b). But they are also "Federal civilian employee[s]" who are "assigned to a civilian position." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216(a). As a result, dual-status technicians are "afforded the benefits and rights generally provided for federal employees in the civil service," <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard v. FLRA</span>, 677 F.2d 276, 279 (3d Cir. 1982), including rights under the FSLMRS. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 284; <span class="Italic">see also Lipscomb v. FLRA</span>, 333 F.3d 611, 620 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In February 2014, the Guard concluded an investigation into misconduct at its training base in Grayling, Michigan. Based on its findings, the Guard terminated two dual-status technicians. The terminated technicians appealed this decision through the Guard's internal administrative process, in which they were represented by their union, the Laborers' International Union of North America, Local 2132, AFL-CIO (the "union").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 12, 2014, in connection with the administrative appeal, the Guard's deputy general counsel (and prosecuting attorney against the technicians), Captain David Bedells, sent a letter to the technicians' union representative, Ben Banchs. The letter read as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Please be advised that this office will represent the interests of [the Guard] at the administrative hearing requested by your client. Accordingly, any and all communications with employees or representatives of [the Guard] regarding this matter should be directed to this office. Any communications with employees or representatives of [the Guard] outside the presence of a[&#8197;] [Guard] attorney are improper until such time as the administrative hearing examiner determines that further pre-hearing interviews are necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Banchs responded to this letter by email on March 17, claiming that the Guard had "no legal authority to regulate communications between bargaining unit employees...and the Union concerning this or any other employment matter." Banchs' email also expressed his concern that the Guard's directive would prohibit the terminated technicians from contacting any union employees, including "Family Services, the Human Resources Office, the Chaplain, or even an [Inspector General]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On March 20, Captain Bedells responded with another letter. He disputed Banchs' broad interpretation of the original letter, arguing that its "express reference to 'regarding this matter'" indicated that its scope was limited to "communications [that] concern matters related to the subject of the 'administrative hearing requested by your client(s).'" Captain Bedells also contended that "no reasonable interpretation" of his first letter would suggest that the technicians were "prohibited from 'making contact with Family Services, the Human Resources Office, the Chaplain or even the [Inspector General].'" Finally, the second letter also made clear that the directive from the original letter "remain[ed] in place."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union responded by filing an unfair-labor-practice charge with the FLRA's Chicago Regional Office, which subsequently issued a complaint. On October 23, 2015, an Administrative Law Judge for the FLRA granted the motion for summary judgment brought by the FLRA's General Counsel, determining that the Guard committed an unfair labor practice in violation of the FSLMRS. The Guard then filed exceptions to the ALJ's decision. The FLRA denied these exceptions, relying on its interpretation of Captain Bedells' original letter as a "sweeping command...[that] prohibited private communications with <span class="Italic">all</span> bargaining-unit employees." <span class="Italic">Mich. Army Nat'l Guard and Laborers' Int'l Union of N. Am., Local 2132, AFL-CIO</span>, 69 FLRA 393, 397 (May 25, 2016) (emphasis in original). The FLRA ordered the Guard to cease and desist from "[p]rohibiting private communication between bargaining-unit employees and their Union representatives," and to post notice of its violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Guard refused to comply. The FLRA then petitioned for enforcement of its order in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(b). On February 7, 2017, the Fourth Circuit transferred the case to this court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis ultimately depends on the scope of the letter.&#x2003;Here, the FLRA's interpretation of the letter as a "sweeping command...[that] prohibited private communications with <span class="Italic">all</span> bargaining unit employees" is supported by substantial evidence. On its face, the letter purports to forbid "[a]ny communications with employees or representatives of [the Guard] outside the presence of [a Guard] attorney...until such time as the administrative hearing examiner determines that further pre-hearing interviews are necessary." The letter's plain text thus appears to ban temporarily all private union-employee communication, regardless of subject matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The letter's scope is a question of fact. Accordingly, the FLRA's interpretation of the letter's scope is conclusive if it is "supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). The Guard argues that the sentence of the letter relied upon by the FLRA must be read in conjunction with the preceding sentence, which states that "all communications with employees or representatives of [the Guard] <span class="Italic">regarding this matter</span> should be directed to this office" (emphasis added). According to the Guard, this narrowed the letter's scope, such that it only prohibited private union-employee communications about the subject matter of the termination proceedings, and even then only temporarily. Therefore, says the Guard, the FLRA drastically misinterpreted the letter's scope when it characterized the letter as a "sweeping command" that "extended far beyond the scope of the internal administrative hearings concerning the technicians' misconduct and prohibited private communications with <span class="Italic">all</span> bargaining-unit employees." <span class="Italic">Mich. Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 69 FLRA at 397.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However plausible the Guard's argument may be, it was on balance reasonable, under the substantial evidence standard applicable to this case, for the FLRA to rely on the explicit language of the letter, particularly in light of the way it was understood by the recipient. Substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Perales</span>, 402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S. Ct. 1420, 28 L. Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <span class="Italic">Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S. Ct. 206, 83 L. Ed. 126 (1938)). In making this determination, we "consider the evidence contrary to the [agency's] conclusions, but may not conduct <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the record." <span class="Italic">Turnbull Cone Baking Co. of Tenn. v. NLRB</span>, 778 F.2d 292, 295 (6th Cir. 1985). If the evidence in the record reasonably supports more than one resolution of a question of fact, we will not disturb the FLRA's "choice between two fairly conflicting views." <span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S. Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951); <span class="Italic">W.F. Bolin Co. v. NLRB</span>, 70 F.3d 863, 870 (6th Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the plain text of the letter is sufficient evidence to support the FLRA's broad interpretation. As explained below, in view of the scope attributed to the letter by the FLRA, the letter does not fall outside of FLRA jurisdiction, and substantial evidence supports the finding of a violation of the FSLMRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Guard's first argument is that the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 precludes the FLRA from entertaining challenges to the Guard's technician-termination procedures. This argument fails because the Guard's broad ban on all private union-employee communications, including those wholly unrelated to the subject matter of the termination proceedings, cannot fairly be described as a regulation of the termination proceedings, and therefore falls outside the scope of the Technicians Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress enacted the Technicians Act to accommodate the competing interests created by the National Guard's "unique position in the federal structure." <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 278. While each state unit of the National Guard is "a state agency, under state authority and control," the "activity, makeup, and function of the Guard is provided for, to a large extent, by federal law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 279. The Technicians Act recognizes the federal nature of the National Guard by granting dual-status technicians "the benefits and rights generally provided for federal employees in the civil service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At the same time, however, it reserves to state adjutants general broad authority to make personnel decisions regarding technicians. In particular, the Act provides that "a technician may, at any time, be separated from his technician employment for cause by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(2). It also states that "an adverse action involving discharge from technician employment...shall be accomplished by the adjutant general," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(f)(3), and prohibits any "right of appeal" in a technician-termination proceeding from extending beyond the adjutant general, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(f)(4). This reservation of authority to state adjutants general "can be viewed as a virtual <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for the [Act's] grant of federal employee status." <span class="Italic">N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 284.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Guard contends that &#x00A7; 709(f) places its technician-termination procedures in the unreviewable discretion of the adjutant general, and therefore that the FLRA may not review those procedures to determine whether they comport with federal labor law. However, the Technicians Act will only insulate the Guard's communications ban from review if the ban was in fact a regulation of termination proceedings. If it was not, then it falls outside the scope of the adjutant general's exclusive authority outlined in the Technicians Act. Assuming as we do that the Guard's letter was a "sweeping command" that proscribed private communications <span id="Page_1371"></span>between the union and "all bargaining-unit employees," <span class="Italic">Mich. Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 69 FLRA at 397, the FLRA's exercise of jurisdiction did not violate the Technicians Act. It is true that "the Technicians Act reserves exclusive review of personnel actions affecting technicians for the state adjutants general." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 3936, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 239 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 2001). However, the Guard's letter falls outside this reservation of authority because it extends beyond the regulation of technician-termination proceedings. As interpreted by the FLRA, the letter bans <span class="Italic">all</span> union-employee communications, including those completely unrelated to the termination proceedings. Such a blanket ban on private union-employee communications cannot fairly be understood as regulating the termination proceedings, because it would also prevent employees from discussing unrelated concerns with their union representatives. Were it otherwise, the simple fact that the Guard had initiated disciplinary proceedings against a technician would permit it to temporarily proscribe all protected union-employee communications, including those having nothing to do with the proceedings, and which thus would be unlikely to affect the proceedings' outcome. The Technicians Act does not require such an extraordinary result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case does not require us to decide whether the Technicians Act would preclude review of a more narrowly tailored directive.&#x2003;The Guard asserts that its letter was a "key procedural safeguard" intended to protect its legitimate interest in preventing advocates from engaging in "improper contact with potential witnesses." <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. Model Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 cmt. 7 (prohibiting lawyers from contacting certain employees of a represented organization); Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.4(b), (f) (prohibiting lawyers from "counsel[ing] or assist[ing] a witness to testify falsely" and from "request[ing] a person other than a client to refrain from voluntarily giving relevant information to another party"). The Guard may well have an interest that would justify some regulation of private union-witness contact before a termination proceeding. But because the FLRA found that the letter in this case was not so tailored, we need not address the question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cases cited by the Guard are distinguishable.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3936, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 239 F.3d 66 (1st Cir. 2001), for instance, was a direct challenge to the adjutant general's termination decision, which is not the case here. Similarly distinguishable are cases holding that a state National Guard is not obligated to bargain over union proposals to submit technician personnel decisions to binding arbitration. <span class="Italic">See N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 282; <span class="Italic">Ind. Air Nat'l Guard, Hulman Field, Terre Haute, Ind. v. FLRA</span>, 712 F.2d 1187, 1191 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">State of Neb., Military Dep't, Office of the Adjutant Gen. v. FLRA</span>, 705 F.2d 945, 952 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Cal. Nat'l Guard v. FLRA</span>, 697 F.2d 874, 879 (9th Cir. 1983). These cases rest on the idea that the personnel decisions of state adjutants general cannot be submitted to binding arbitration, because to do so would effectively be to permit an appeal from the adjutant general's decision in plain violation of &#x00A7; 709(f)(4). <span class="Italic">See N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 282. That is not the case here. The Guard also cites a D.C. Circuit opinion for the proposition that the FLRA may not review "a decision that was 'indispensable' or 'integral' to, or 'inextricably intertwined' with, [an] unreviewable agency action." <span class="Italic">Fla. Health Scis. Ctr., Inc. v. Sec'y of Health and Human Servs</span>., 830 F.3d 515, 519 (D.C. Cir. 2016). However relevant this decision might have been to the case of a narrowly tailored letter, it says little about a letter with the "sweeping" nature that the FLRA found in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Guard makes a more general argument that the court should exercise caution before "intruding on the military authority and personnel decisions of state adjutants general." In support, the Guard points to our previous observation that dual-status technicians operate in a capacity that is "irreducibly military in nature." <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Peters</span>, 249 F.3d 433, 439 (6th Cir. 2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Leistiko v. Stone</span>, 134 F.3d 817, 821 (6th Cir. 1998)). But <span class="Italic">Fisher</span> and <span class="Italic">Leistiko</span> were very different from this case. Both involved challenges to an adjutant general's termination decision, in <span class="Italic">Fisher</span> under Title VII and in <span class="Italic">Leistiko</span> under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Fisher</span>, 249 F.3d at 437; <span class="Italic">Leistiko</span>, 134 F.3d at 820-21. These cases hold that because dual-status National Guard technician positions are irreducibly military, Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act simply do not apply to such positions. <span class="Italic">See Fisher</span>, 249 F.3d at 439, 443. A parallel conclusion would be that FSLMRS protections do not apply to dual-status Guard technicians, but that is clearly not the case. <span class="Italic">See N.J. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 286 ("[U]nder the Labor-Management Act, the Guard still must engage in collective bargaining with a union representing Guard technicians'"); <span class="Italic">Lipscomb</span>, 333 F.3d at 620. Assuming that the FSLMRS provides labor rights of any sort to dual-status technicians, which it clearly does, it is hard to see how the basic ability of union members to talk with union officers could not be protected. Military status, in short, does not flatly deprive dual-status technicians of their statutory right "to form, join, or assist any labor organization,...freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finding a ULP based on a record of a complaint and admissions to the allegations by reason of an untimely response to the complaint, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 1184 (2010), determined that 18 USC 1913, making it a crime to use appropriated funds to directly or indirectly pay for communications to influence a member of Congress as to legislation, did not apply preclude union representatives from asking employees, during nonworking time, to support the union's views and positions on legislative issues. FLRA distinguished the analysis of a Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel Memorandum of November 23, 2005, analyzing "grass roots" lobbying by union officials who, on behalf of the union, ask members of the public to communicate with government officials in support of, or in opposition to, legislative matters. Also distinguished was a Comptroller General case, B-202787(1) (unpublished 1981). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-11-048.html#sec3-49">Lobbying</a>."]</p>
