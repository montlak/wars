<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-233"><span class="space">2.</span> Effect of Disability Retirement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An individual does not qualify for restoration upon partial recovery if the employee obtained workers compensation, the compensation ceased upon reemployment of the appellant, and the appellant was then separated by disability retirement. The provisions of 5 CFR Part 353 apply to those who receive benefits from the Employees' Compensation Fund, not from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 217, 219 (1985) (distinguished by <span class="Italic">Brumley</span> and <span class="Italic">Miyashiro</span>,<span class="Italic"> post).</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 188, 190-91 (1986), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has stated in <span class="Italic">Brooks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 217 (1985), that although the term "compensable injury" is not specifically defined under either the statute or the regulations, the statute does however define "compensation" as "the money allowance payable to an employee or his dependents and any other benefits paid for from the Employees' Compensation Fund...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101(12). Because appellant was not receiving a money allowance or other benefits from the Employees' Compensation Fund, he was not receiving compensation under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81. Instead, appellant has presented evidence showing that he had been awarded disability retirement annuity payments. Such payments are made under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 83, which provides that annuity payments are made from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8348(a)(1)(A). Therefore, since the appellant was not receiving compensation under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81, he was not suffering a "compensable injury" under the meaning and intent of that chapter. We conclude, therefore, that the appellant was not entitled to priority consideration for restoration under the provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.307 (1985). Since the appellant has no right to priority consideration for restoration, the presiding official properly dismissed the appeal as not being within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barry v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 432, 436 (1990) (implying that if an individual who has received an OWCP award declines a valid restoration offer in a different job at a lower grade and accepts disability retirement instead, there is no further claim for restoration rights when there was no recurrence of a compensable injury).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, however, the employee receives disability retirement benefits and then shifts to workers compensation, at the terminus of the workers compensation, the employee has restoration rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Metsopulos v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 536, 540 (1987). If the employee elects disability retirement instead of receipt of OWCP benefits, the employee may exercise reemployment rights, according to <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 40 MSPR 1, 3-4 (1989) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 46 MSPR 666 (1991), <span class="Italic">post</span>), distinguishing <span class="Italic">Brooks</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the appellant correctly asserts that the current FPM contains the provision he relies upon in seeking restoration. FPM Ch. 353, Subch. 2-4 (Feb. 24, 1988) states that the election of disability retirement in lieu of compensation does not affect restoration rights so long as the individual applies for restoration as soon as he or she overcomes the specific job-related injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this provision is not binding law or regulation, and only constitutes the Office of Personnel Management's guidance to agencies,...we find that it is entitled to weight in this appeal because it is consistent with congressional policy regarding this restoration issue. The legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 shows Congress' intent to provide reemployment priority rights for those employees who have sustained on-the-job injuries. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 812 F.2d 705, 709 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">citing</span> 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 5341, 5344. We find that the appellant here is such an employee.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although previous judicial and Board decisions in this area have focused on where the benefits are actually paid from, in determining restoration rights, those cases are distinguishable from the present case because the employees there were not awarded OWCP benefits. For example, the employee in <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 812 F.2d at 706-07, was denied OWCP benefits while the appellant in this appeal received benefits prior to electing disability retirement. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Brooks v. United States Postal Service,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 217, 218 (1985), the employee had accepted a permanent light-duty position after having received OWCP benefits in connection with an earlier injury, but then elected to receive a disability retirement annuity instead of accepting a suitable position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Further adjudication is necessary to determine whether the appellant has recovered from his injuries.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who suffers a compensable injury and partially recovers or fully recovers more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation is entitled to certain reemployment rights, and may appeal to the Board the denial of such rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8141(b)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.306, 353.307, and 353.401(a)(3). <span class="Italic">See also Watson v. Department of the Army,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 435, 437 (1984). An employee is generally deemed "fully recovered" when OWCP benefits are terminated, because such benefits end when an individual regains his or her earning capacity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102(e). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Detherage v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 411, 413 (1986); <span class="Italic">Carter v. United States Postal Service,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 252, 254-55. An employee is considered to be "partially recovered" when there is an improvement in the individual's condition from the time that he or she ceased working for the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.306; <span class="Italic">Iverson v. United States Postal Service,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 581, 583 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the extent of the appellant's recovery, if any, is unclear. First, although OWCP terminated the appellant's benefits, that decision was based on the appellant's election of disability retirement benefits, not on any determination that the appellant was recovered or partially recovered from his work-related illness. Second, the appellant has not explained the nature and extent of his recovery, or submitted any supporting documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we REMAND this appeal for further adjudication, including a hearing, to determine whether the appellant is a fully recovered or partially recovered employee, and, if so, whether the agency violated his restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 46 MSPR 666, 470-75 (1991), that if an employee who received compensation then secures disability retirement benefits, he may seek restoration based on full recovery from the compensable injury even if the disability retirement has not terminated; in that and other circumstances, "we will examine whether the employee was in fact recovered, and whether the agency acted reasonably in ascertaining the medical status of the employee and in providing that employee the restoration rights warranted under the circumstances":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 provides Federal employees with restoration rights upon recovery from an on-the-job compensable injury. It states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management...the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2). The term "compensation" is defined as including the money allowance payable to an employee and any other benefits paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101(12).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with this statutory mandate, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) promulgated 5 C.F.R. Part 353. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303 (1988) provides restoration rights for injured employees who take longer than 1 year to recover from their injuries. It states that an employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date compensation began is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left, or an equivalent one, provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401 states that an individual who "fully recovers" from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation began may appeal an agency's failure to restore or improper restoration to the Board. The regulations also define "fully recovered" as meaning that compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he left or an equivalent one. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, by using the term "compensation," the statutory and regulatory provisions pertaining to the restoration rights in question in this case focus on the receipt of benefits from the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101(12). Under certain circumstances, however, an employee entitled to OWCP benefits may elect to receive other benefits for his injury, including disability retirement, in lieu of OWCP benefits. <span id="Page_4510"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8116(b). Further, as we held in <span class="Italic">Brumley,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. at 3, an employee's election of disability retirement in lieu of OWCP benefits does not affect his restoration rights. Because the regulatory framework for restoration rights and appeals focuses only on the award of OWCP benefits, the question presented is, therefore, how an employee may show that he is "fully recovered" for restoration purposes where he has exercised his statutory right to elect benefits other than those provided by OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge tried to answer this question by drawing a parallel between workers' compensation and disability retirement. The administrative judge found that allowing a disability annuitant to be deemed "fully recovered" in the absence of a termination of retirement benefits would unduly favor such annuitants over OWCP recipients, who can only show "full recovery" through a cessation of compensation benefits. The administrative judge also found that the relevant provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) suggest that OPM did not contemplate different recovery standards for disability annuitants and OWCP recipients. Finally, the administrative judge relied upon the deposition of Raleigh M. Neville, a Program Manager with OPM, and the author of 5 U.S.C. Part 353, in concluding that a cessation of disability retirement benefits is required for a finding that the appellant is "fully recovered." According to the administrative judge, Mr. Neville stated that, where a person elected disability retirement in lieu of compensation, one must look at the cessation of disability retirement benefits, even though the regulations do not specifically say that. The administrative judge also found that Mr. Neville specifically stated that he agreed that the right to restoration to duty is triggered by the termination of payments of either OWCP or disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed below, we find that the administrative judge's conclusion, that the cessation of disability retirement benefits is a prerequisite for showing that the employee is "fully recovered," is unduly restrictive, and that, in cases such as this, an appellant may establish that he or she is "fully recovered" through other evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions do not require the cessation of disability retirement benefits as a prerequisite for restoration rights for employees such as the appellant. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) does not specifically require the cessation of any benefits as a prelude to restoration. It only states that agencies must make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, employees in former or equivalent positions where the employees overcome their injury within a period of more than 1 year after the date compensation commenced. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 5 C.F.R. Part 353 requires the termination of compensation to satisfy the definition of "fully recovered," it does not speak to cases where the employee has not been receiving compensation from OWCP because of an election to receive disability retirement. Indeed, Mr. Neville stated that, in drafting Part 353, he never anticipated that an employee would elect disability retirement in lieu of OWCP, and that the term "fully recovered" in Part 353 only applies to someone who is receiving compensation from OWCP. Thus, while termination of OWCP benefits triggers restoration rights where the employee has been receiving such benefits, there is neither statutory nor regulatory authority to support the proposition that a disability annuity must be terminated for a vesting of restoration rights under the circumstances of the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the FPM supports the proposition that restoration rights may be triggered through other means. With respect to the circumstances presented in the instant case, it states that the election of disability retirement in lieu of compensation does not affect an individual's restoration rights provided he or she applies for restoration as soon as the specific job-related injury has been overcome. FPM Chapter 353, Subch. 2-4 (1988). Thus, the application for restoration upon recovery, rather than a termination of benefits, triggers the employee's entitlement to restoration rights under the FPM. This conclusion is further supported by other provisions of the FPM. For example, in discussing the purpose of the instructions contained in the FPM with respect to restoration rights, it states that to protect his or her restoration rights, an employee is expected to seek restoration as soon as he or she is able. FPM Chapter 353, Subch. 2-1(b) (1988). It also states that employees have an obligation to keep the agency informed of their medical status and to seek restoration as soon as the medical condition permits. FPM Chapter 353, Subch. 2-3(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conclusion that restoration rights are triggered by the recovery from the compensable injury, rather than from the cancellation of benefits, is further supported by the Neville deposition. Although, as found by the administrative judge, Mr. Neville stated that he agreed that restoration rights are triggered by the termination of either disability retirement or OWCP payments, he also stated that overcoming the injury triggers restoration rights, that termination of benefits is not the only way to qualify for such rights, that employees have an obligation to return to work without a termination of their benefits when they believe that they have recovered from their compensable injury,[7] that Part 353 was aimed at getting employees back on the rolls when they overcome their injuries, and that determining whether someone is "fully recovered" is a factual determination to be made under the particular circumstances of each case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. 10.124(a) (stating that an employee whose disability has ceased and who is able to resume regular Federal employment has the obligation to do so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Kinler v. General Services Administration,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 197 (1990), further supports the conclusion that a termination of disability retirement benefits is not required as a threshold for restoration entitlement. In <span class="Italic">Kinler,</span> the appellant suffered a stroke while employed as a GS-12 Supervisory Traffic Management Specialist, and applied for both disability retirement and OWCP benefits. OWCP at first approved benefits, finding that the appellant's job stresses aggravated his previously existing medical condition. It later determined, however, that the appellant's medical condition was no longer work-related and terminated his compensation benefits. The appellant received disability retirement following OWCP's termination of compensation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While still receiving disability retirement benefits, Kinler sought restoration to the vacant position of GM-13 position of Traffic Manager. When the agency refused this request he appealed the matter to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On review of the administrative judge's conclusion that Kinler lacked restoration rights to the position in question because it was graded higher than the position he had previously occupied, we held that Kinler may have had restoration rights to the GS-13 position if his former GS-12 position had been upgraded. We therefore remanded the case for further adjudication on this matter. In doing so, we stated that OWCP's termination of benefits was not dispositive of the issue of whether Kinler was fully recovered, and that, on remand, the appellant must show that he was fully recovered at the time he sought restoration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude in this appeal that the continued receipt of disability retirement benefits does not preclude the appellant from exercising his restoration rights, and showing before us that he was "fully recovered" from his compensable injury and capable of performing the duties of his former position, or an equivalent position, when he sought restoration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we note that agencies have both the obligation and the authority to ensure that employees seeking restoration upon recovery from a compensable injury, such as the appellant, are medically able to perform the duties of the position in question. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 339,301 and 831.502, and FPM Supplement 831-1, Subch. 15-3, agencies have the responsibility and authority to ensure that such individuals meet all of the qualifications for the position in question, and may order them to undergo a medical examination to make this determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301 contains several provisions with respect to medical examinations for individuals seeking restoration following a compensable injury. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(a)(1) provides agencies with authority to require an individual applying for or occupying a position which has physical/medical standards for selection or retention, or which is part of an established program of medical surveillance related to occupational or environmental exposure or demands, to undergo a medical evaluation prior to appointment or selection, including reemployment on the basis of recovery from a medical condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection (d) of this regulation also allows an agency to offer a medical examination to an individual seeking reemployment on the basis of full or partial recovery after it determines that it cannot grant, support, or act on the reemployment request without verification of the individual's current clinical status. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(d). Thus, agencies have direct regulatory authority to ensure that individuals seeking restoration are in fact sufficiently recovered to perform the duties of the positions in question, and may properly refuse to act on such restoration requests in the absence of clinical information regarding the individual's status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. 831.502(f)(1) enables agencies to work in conjunction with OPM to ensure that a disability annuitant seeking reemployment is qualified for the position in question. It states that a disability annuitant may be reemployed in any position for which he or she is qualified, and that the employing agency shall notify OPM of the reemployment, including the nature of the position and the type of appointment. OPM may then review the notification of reemployment, and order the annuitant to undergo an examination under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(d). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(f)(4). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(d)(2), OPM may order a medical or other examination at any time to determine the facts relative to the nature and degree of disability of an annuitant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the FPM makes clear that agencies should determine whether a disability annuitant is able to perform the duties of the position in question prior to reemploying him. It states that OPM Form BRI 46-10 is sufficient evidence of recovery, and that, unless the annuitant presents this form, the agency should determine whether the annuitant meets all qualifications for the position in question. FPM Supplement 831-1, Subch. 15-3. It further states that if the agency has its own medical examining facilities, it should conduct a medical examination to determine whether <span id="Page_4511"></span>the applicant has recovered from the disability and is able to do the work of the position in question. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the agency does not have such facilities, it should request OPM to arrange for a medical examination and return the report of the examination to the agency. If the examination reveals that the annuitant can perform the duties in question, the agency should send OPM the report and request to reemploy the annuitant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, therefore, conclude, that, in balancing a former employee's duty and right to return to Federal employment as soon as possible after recovery from a compensable injury, with the agency's duty and right to ensure that the employee is able to perform the duties of the position in question, when restoration is sought in the absence of a cessation of benefits on the basis of a full recovery from a compensable injury, we will examine whether the employee was in fact recovered, and whether the agency acted reasonably in ascertaining the medical status of the employee and in providing that employee the restoration rights warranted under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Raicovich v. United States Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417, 424 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Kinler,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. at 203<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the employee received OWCP benefits both before and after he was awarded a disability retirement annuity, and if his separation was substantially related to or resulted from his disability, he may have a claim for restoration rights upon recovery. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miyashiro v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 199, 202 (1995) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Brooks v. USPS,</span> 26 MSPR 217 (1985), and <span class="Italic">Pryor v. USPS,</span> 61 MSPR 202 (1994), and noting that "[a] retroactive award of OWCP benefits, covering the period of receipt of disability retirement benefits based on the same illness or injury that was the basis of the separation by disability retirement, would be effective to give the employee the status of an employee injured on-the-job and entitled to the restoration rights of such an employee when he recovered, notwithstanding the intervening grant of disability retirement.").</p>
