<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">In re Gurwit</span>, 63 Comp. Gen. 99, 104 (1983), there should be no deduction from back pay of unemployment compensation benefits paid to an employee. The state that paid the benefits may require its repayment from an employee who receives a back pay award. <span class="Italic">Bridgeman v. DHUD</span>, 25 MSPR 518, 519 (1984). According to <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 45 MSPR 580, 584-85 (1990), however, the rule barring deductions of compensation benefits is not so hard and fast. The Board observed that the state paying the compensation may have a role in the manner of its recoupment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the repayment of unemployment benefits, in <span class="Italic">In re Gurwit</span>, 63 Comp. Gen. 99, 104 (1983), the United States Comptroller General determined that, because "unemployment compensation received from a State by an employee during a period of unjustified or unwarranted separation from the Federal service may be required to be refunded" to the state by the employee, "no deduction should be made by a Federal agency from back pay to which the employee is otherwise entitled on restoration." <span class="Italic">See also</span> 50 Comp. Gen. 180 (1970) (where an employee might have been required to refund unemployment compensation to the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission unemployment compensation was not to be deducted from his back pay award). In <span class="Italic">In re Kassel</span>, 65 Comp. Gen. 865, 869 (1986), the Comptroller General modified the decision in <span class="Italic">Gurwit</span>, finding that "unemployment benefits must be deducted from back pay awards where the appropriate state agency has determined that an overpayment has occurred and has notified the employer, rather than the employee, to refund overpayments."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, when an employee has received unemployment compensation and then is awarded back pay, the state unemployment compensation fund must be replenished by an amount equal to the unemployment compensation benefits received by the employee, <span class="Italic">either</span> by the employer deducting that amount from the back pay award and paying it into the fund <span class="Italic">or</span> by the State collecting from the employee himself.[5]...It is mandatory that the unemployment compensation fund be replenished, but it is not mandatory that this be done by the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The agency was informed by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry that it could repay the Pennsylvania Unemployment Fund for the unemployment compensation received by the appellant. The Department of Labor and Industry, however, did not indicate that this was the mandatory or sole method of recoupment of unemployment compensation by the state....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the agency properly deducted overpayment of unemployment compensation benefits from the appellant's back pay.... Further, because the agency has refunded the Pennsylvania unemployment compensation fund, the state will not seek further repayment of the unemployment compensation from the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holtgrewe v. FDIC</span>, 65 MSPR 137, 140 (1994) (if the appellant directly reimbursed the state for unemployment benefits, the agency was not required to reimburse the appellant unless the agency deducted those benefit payments from the appellant's back pay); <span class="Italic">Lucas v. DOD</span>, 64 MSPR 172, 181 (1994) (applying the law of Pennsylvania); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 274, 275-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-6 (2001) (tracing the agency's compliance efforts to demonstrate the repayment of unemployment compensation benefits to the state government); <span class="Italic">Tippetts v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 497, 503-04 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) (settlement agreement may stipulate whether the employer or employee will be responsible for refunding unemployment compensation benefits to the state; appellant apparently did not object when, despite a contrary provision in the agreement, the agency deducted the benefits he received and refunded them to the state; the agency was required to correct the erroneous information it provided to the state).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shobert v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 122 MSPR 367, 2015 MSPB 25 (2015)), explained how an agency is to justify an offset from the employee's back pay for restored unemployment compensation benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, the Board rejected the appellant's argument that unemployment compensation should not be withheld from his back pay award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 181. The Board noted that under Pennsylvania law, when an employee has received unemployment compensation and then is awarded back pay, the state unemployment fund must be replenished by an amount equal to the unemployment compensation benefits received by the employee, either by the employer deducting that amount from the back pay award and paying it into the fund or by the state collecting from the employee himself. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the employing agency shared liability for reimbursement of the unemployment compensation funds under Pennsylvania law, the Board found that the agency could properly deduct the amount of the appellant's unemployment compensation if it shows that it has reimbursed the Pennsylvania unemployment fund in the same amount. <span class="Italic">Id. Accord: Baughman v. Department of the Army,</span> 45 MSPR 580 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency has not shown that it is required to reimburse unemployment compensation monies pursuant to Oklahoma law. Moreover, a memorandum from DFAS provided by the agency states that "[a]s of this date DFAS has not paid the Oklahoma Security Commission." Accordingly, if the agency offsets the appellant's unemployment compensation, it must provide the Board with evidence that it was required to do so pursuant to Oklahoma law and that payment in the amount of the offset was in fact made to the State of Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand to the AJ for further consideration of the dispute over the agency's decision to deduct from the appellant's back pay the unemployment compensation he received, a decision of a state tribunal to the effect that no overpayment occurred was binding on the employing agency, <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 91 MSPR 572, 576-77 &#x00B6; 13 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of whether the appellant received an overpayment of UCFE benefits is a matter governed by the unemployment compensation law of Oklahoma. The UCFE statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agreement [between the Secretary of Labor and the State] shall provide that compensation will be paid by the State to a Federal employee in the same amount, <span class="Italic">on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as the compensation which would be payable to him under the unemployment compensation law of the State</span> if his Federal service and Federal wages assigned under section 8504 of this title to the State had been included as employment and wages under that State law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8502(b) (emphasis supplied). The Department of Labor's UCFE regulations specifically provide that, with the exception of cases involving false statements or representations, state law applies to the recovery or waiver of overpayments. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 609.11(f). <span class="Italic">See also id</span>. at &#x00A7; 609.11(g) (recovery of any overpayment of UCFE shall not be enforced until a final determination or redetermination establishing the overpayment has been made). As the Comptroller General has observed, States may specifically exclude unemployment compensation from the definition of wages or earnings to be offset. <span class="Italic">In re Gurwit</span>, 63 Comp. Gen. 99, 104 (1983).[3] The Comptroller General found that the UCFE statute and regulations grant to the States the right to determine when and how to recover overpayments of unemployment compensation paid to Federal employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Neither the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, nor Office of Personnel Management regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.801, <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span>[4] permit the agency to make a deduction for UCFE benefits on its own authority. Accordingly, the agency must pay the appellant the amount of the offset, with the applicable interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">In re Gurwit</span>, the Comptroller General held that no deduction should be made by a Federal agency from the back pay to which the employee was otherwise entitled. The basis for the Comptroller General's decision was that unemployment compensation received by an employee during a period of unjustified or unwarranted separation from the Federal service may be required to be refunded to the State, creating liability on the part of the employee. The Comptroller General later modified this rule, stating that "unemployment benefits must be deducted from back pay awards where the appropriate state agency has determined that an overpayment has occurred and has notified the employer, rather than the employee, to refund overpayments." <span class="Italic">In re Kassel,</span> 65 Comp. Gen. 865 (1986). Both Comptroller General decisions are discussed in <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Department of the Army</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 580, 584-85 (1990).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency can properly offset workers' compensation from appellant's back pay award. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 USC 8116(a), prohibits an employee receiving workers' compensation payments from receiving any type of remuneration from the Federal government. Since the receipt of back pay is part of appellant's right of restoration, he is entitled only to that pay he would have received beyond the worker's compensation payments he actually received. Additionally, appellant would only be owed interest on that portion of his compensation that was wrongfully denied him: the difference between his salary and the workers' compensation payments he received.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Garcy v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-08-0528-C-1 (NP 11/3/2010), added as to deduction of OWCP received from back pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an agency can properly offset OWCP payments from an appellant's back pay award. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 9 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Boomer v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 540, 544 (1991); <span class="Italic">Gay v.

Therefore, the appellant is entitled to a back pay award with an offset for the OWCP payments he received during the relevant period and the agency properly offset that award from his back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's assertions that the agency is garnishing his wages, the Secretary of Labor has authority to recover overpayments of OWCP benefits and the Board has no jurisdiction to review that matter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8129; <span class="Italic">Riley v.

Thus, the appellant must pursue any appeal of the reduction of his wages to repay OWCP through the Department of Labor. Accordingly, we find the agency has established its compliance with the Board's final decision on the merits of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an employee's removal is rescinded by the agency, the employee is not entitled to back pay or to incidental benefits of back pay if he is on workers' compensation status during the period covered by the rescinded adverse action, <span class="Italic">Hagan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ informed the appellant during the telephonic status conference, he is not entitled to any back pay or interest for the period between his removal and the date of the rescission of his removal. The Federal Employees Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8116(a), prohibits an employee who is awarded OWCP benefits from receiving any other remuneration from the Federal government. Further, the Supreme Court declared that this statute was enacted for the purpose of providing the exclusive remedy for injured employees of the United States. <span class="Italic">See Johansen v. United States</span>, 343 U.S. 427, 439-41 (1952).

S<span class="Italic">ee</span> <span class="Italic">Roja</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 621. Thus, the appellant's claims to entitlement to back pay and interest on the back pay under the Back Pay Act are wholly without merit. Similarly, the Board has no authority to award compensation for any additional expense he incurred to obtain a private life insurance policy because the Back Pay Act does not provide for compensatory damages or incidental expenses. <span class="Italic">See Cunningham v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that Steen is barred from receiving back pay by 5 USC &#x00A7; 8116(a), which prohibits an employee who is receiving OWCP benefits from receiving salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States, the CALJ relied on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Roja v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 618, 621 (1992), wherein it found that an employee who received OWCP benefits between the time of his removal and the time that action was rescinded was not entitled to back pay because he had received those benefits. We disagree with the CALJ's finding, and conclude that his reliance on <span class="Italic">Roja</span> was misplaced because, unlike the instant case, there was no indication in <span class="Italic">Roja</span> that the OWCP payments the appellant received were a result of, or in any way related to, an illegal action taken against him. To deny Steen full back pay in this case because he received lesser OWCP payments has the effect of putting him, a victim of a prohibited personnel practice who thereafter became ill and unable to work as a result of the prohibited personnel practice, in a worse position than a similarly-situated victim who remained able to work. This is both illogical and unjust, and the Board has recognized this anomaly and addressed it directly. In <span class="Italic">Gay v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 MSPR 1, 3 (1990), the Board acknowledged that 5 USC &#x00A7; 8116(a) prohibits an employee receiving OWCP payments from receiving remuneration from the Federal Government, and found that, since the receipt of back pay is part of an appellant's right to restoration, he is entitled only to that pay he would have received beyond the OWCP payments he actually received. Thus, the Board found that an agency can properly offset OWCP payments from an appellant's back pay award. <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 3-4; <span class="Italic">see also Boomer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 540, 544 (1991). The courts have reached a similar result in the case of a victim of sex discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Nichols v. Frank</span>, 42 F.3d 503, 515 (9th Cir. 1994). These cases are consistent with and reflect the notion that, in computing back pay, an agency may not include any period during which the employee was unavailable to perform the duties of his job, and his unavailability was not related to, or caused by, the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(2); <span class="Italic">see also Sexton v.

<p class="Body-Text">Receipt of OWCP benefits does not block a back pay recovery if the employee was the victim of disability discrimination, according to <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 123, 126-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (2001), adopting an EEOC decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant was entitled to back pay minus OWCP wage replacement benefits received during the period of the constructive suspension, the EEOC relied primarily upon <span class="Italic">Nichols v.</span> <span class="Italic">Frank,</span> 42 F.3d 503 (9th Cir. 1994), in which the court held that a Postal Service employee who proved <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> sexual harassment was entitled to recover payments for discriminatory harm to the full extent allowed by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including the difference between the employee's OWCP benefits and 100% of the salary she would have received during her disability period. In reaching this conclusion, the court in <span class="Italic">Nichols</span> found that the FECA provision making OWCP benefits the exclusive remedy for a federal employee's workplace injury, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8116, applies only to additional payments for work-related injuries, and does not preclude equitable relief, including back pay, authorized by Title VII<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 515-16. Relying on <span class="Italic">Nichols,</span> the EEOC implicitly found in the present case that given that the agency discriminated against the appellant, he should have been accommodated during the period of the constructive suspension, and that he was therefore entitled to recover back pay under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(1) as make-whole relief for the agency's discrimination during that period with an appropriate offset for OWCP wage replacement benefits he received during that time.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Compensatory damages do not include back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of relief authorized under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g). <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Schultz II</span> [<span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 159 (1998)], the Board relied upon <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 31 MSPR 604, 606 (1986), in reaching its determination that the appellant was not entitled to back pay under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, for the period of the constructive suspension because of the appellant's receipt of OWCP wage replacement benefits during that time. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Board held that the issue of whether the appellant was involuntarily placed in a leave without pay status for more than 14 days constituted a constructive suspension was moot because he received OWCP benefits for the period in question. The Board therefore implicitly found in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> that the appellant's receipt of OWCP benefits during the relevant period precluded his receipt of back pay for the period because he was not ready, willing and able to work at that time. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 MSPR 453, 456 (in order to be entitled to back pay, it is the appellant's burden to prove that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the duties of his position at all relevant times), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 104 F.3d 376 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Unlike the present case, however, there was no finding in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> that the agency committed disability discrimination and was therefore required to accommodate the appellant. Therefore, as implicitly found by the EEOC, the Board's reliance on <span class="Italic">Williams</span> in <span class="Italic">Schultz II</span> was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC's finding that the appellant is entitled to back pay with an offset <span id="Page_4914"></span>for OWCP wage replacement benefits he received during the period of the constructive suspension is consistent with several Board decisions that were issued after <span class="Italic">Williams</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Brownlow v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 85 MSPR 349 &#x00B6; 9 (2000); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel</span>. <span class="Italic">Steen v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 MSPR 1, 3 (1990). The EEOC decision is therefore consistent with civil service law as well as discrimination law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the EEOC found that the appellant was entitled to an award of back pay pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g), we find that the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596 is the appropriate authority under which to award back pay here. Although 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g) is a general statute that authorizes an award of relief, including reinstatement with or without back pay, against an employer who has intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the Back Pay Act is a more specific statute that applies to cases arising in the Federal employment context, including cases which involve preference-eligible employees of the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">See Andress v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 56 MSPR 501, 508 (1993). Given the appellant's preference-eligible status, <span class="Italic">see Schultz I,</span> 70 MSPR at 635, the Back Pay Act is the appropriate authority under which to award back pay here.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although the appellant is arguably entitled to back pay under both statutes, we note that the Back Pay Act is the more generous of the two statutes. An agency's back pay liability under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g) is limited to a period of 2 years prior to the filing of a charge with EEOC, and may be reduced by interim earnings or "amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against..." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(1). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, back pay may be awarded for the period up to 6 years before the date of the filing of a timely appeal or, absent such filing, the date of the administrative determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4). In addition, the Back Pay Act does not require that a back pay award be offset by what an employee reasonably should have earned during the relevant period; rather, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596 requires only that an award of back pay be offset by amounts actually earned by the employee through other employment during the period at issue<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;For those periods during which the appellant received OWCP wage replacement benefits after the agency demoted her to a PS-04 position, the record does not indicate whether OWCP awarded the appellant wage replacement benefits based on the pay of the PS-04 position or based on the pay of the EAS-17 position the appellant occupied prior to her demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8101(4) ("monthly pay" means the monthly pay at the time of the injury, or the monthly pay at the time disability begins, or the monthly pay at the time the compensable disability occurs), 8105(a) (the basic monthly compensation for total disability is 66 2/3% of the employee's monthly pay), 8111(b)(1) (a disabled employee with one or more dependants [sic] is entitled to have his compensation augmented at the rate of 8 1/3% of his monthly pay). If the appellant is ultimately entitled to back pay for the periods during which she received OWCP wage replacement benefits while her demotion was in effect, the back pay with the offset for the OWCP wage replacement benefits she received during these periods should be sufficient to make her whole for these periods, regardless of the level of OWCP benefits she might have received while her demotion was in effect. However, if the appellant is not entitled to back pay for those periods because she was not ready, willing, and able to work in her Supervisor position for reasons unrelated to her demotion, and if the OWCP wage replacement benefits the appellant received during this period were based on the monthly pay for her PS-04 position, rather than the EAS-17 position to which the Board has ordered the appellant retroactively reinstated, the appellant may ultimately receive less in the form of OWCP wage replacement benefits than she would have received if the agency had not demoted her, unless OWCP adjusts her benefits to account for the higher monthly pay the appellant would have received as an EAS-17 supervisor. Accordingly, if the agency determines that the appellant is not entitled to back pay for any period of time she was receiving OWCP wage replacement benefits while her demotion was in effect, its narrative should describe the steps it has taken to ensure that OWCP will make the proper adjustment to the benefits the appellant received. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v.

In this case, however, we find OPM's interpretation of the Back Pay Act--precluding an award of back pay to an employee who suffered an unwarranted personnel action, for a period of time during which he was receiving state workers' compensation benefits for injuries suffered during interim employment--to be unreasonable. OPM's interpretation does not harmonize with the intent of the Act. The purpose of the Act was to "consolidate and liberalize existing law on the restoration of an employee to his position after an adverse action against him has been found by appellate authority to have been erroneous or unjustified." S. Rep. No. 89-1062, 1 (1966), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1966 USCCAN 2097. More specifically, the Act "puts the employee in the same position he would have been in had the unjustified or erroneous personnel action not taken place." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. And the basic principle of back pay, adopted by Congress in 1948, "holds that an employee is entitled to be made whole whenever an erroneous personnel action which has terminated or reduced his compensation is corrected by appropriate authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The main issue before us is whether the Board must look at the cause of a disability before excluding the period of time a wrongfully terminated employee was disabled and unable to work from the back pay period. According to the language of the Act itself, a wrongfully terminated employee is entitled to back pay equal to an amount he <span class="Italic">"normally would have earned or received</span> during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period." 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596 (emphasis added). This statutory language does not explicitly require a causation analysis. However, the Congressional intent of the Back Pay Act, along with the requirement of a causation analysis in connection with the back pay provisions of similar federal statutes lead us to hold that denying an employee back pay for a period of disability without looking at the cause of the disability is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree that the cases interpreting the back pay provisions of other federal statutes, such as the National Labor Relations Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are not controlling in this case, we may look to them for guidance. The back pay provisions of the NLRA and Title VII are closely related, <span class="Italic">see Albemarle</span> <span class="Italic">Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 419 &#x0026; n.11 (1975) (finding that "the backpay provision [of Title VII] was expressly modeled on the backpay provision of the National Labor Relations Act..." and analyzing legislative history of Title VII), and under both statutes, a causation analysis has been adopted in determining whether periods <span id="Page_4915"></span>of disability are to be included in a back pay period. The Supreme Court recognized that the purpose of both acts was to make workers whole who had suffered on account of unfair labor practices. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. This is also the stated purpose of the Back Pay Act as explicitly recognized in the legislative history of the Act. Furthermore, we have stated that in enforcing compliance of a Board cancellation of an employee's termination, we "cannot distinguish, in this regard, the MSPB's remedial powers from those of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).... the basic purpose of a reinstatement or back pay order is 'restoration of the situation, as nearly as possible to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination."' <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (quoting <span class="Italic">Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 313 U.S. 177 (1941)). In determining whether periods during which an improperly discharged employee was unable to work should be included in a back pay calculation, the NLRB has stated that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]t is thus apparent that the practice of disallowing backpay without inquiry as to the nature of the physical disability, <span class="Italic">the cause thereof</span>, the probability of similar illness in the Respondent's [employees] employ, etc., may be convenient but is not always equitable. Rather, we think that equity and reason require that periods of unavailability for work because of illness or accident must be considered on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Where an interim</span> <span class="Italic">disability is closely related to the nature of the interim employment or</span> <span class="Italic">arises from the unlawful discharge and is not a usual incident of the</span> <span class="Italic">hazards of living generally, the period of disability will not be excluded</span> <span class="Italic">from backpay</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">American Mfg. Co. of Tex.</span>, 167 NLRB 520, 522 (1967) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given that the purpose of the Back Pay Act is to place a wrongfully discharged employee back in the position he would have been in had the termination not occurred and to make the employee whole, equity and reason require that if such an employee is unable to work because of an accident or illness closely related or due to interim employment or arises because of the unlawful discharge, the period of disability should be included in a back pay period. In this situation, an interpretation of the Back Pay Act denying Martin back pay, with appropriate offsets, for the period during which he was receiving workers' compensation benefits, would be contrary to Congressional intent. Denying Martin back pay for the period between September 9, 1993 and January 10, 1994 would not place him in the same position he would have been in had he not suffered the unjustified personnel action. Martin's injury was closely related to the nature of his interim employment and was not a "hazard of living generally." In order to be made whole, as is the intent of the Back Pay Act, Martin should be awarded back pay for the time he suffered an "abnormal" interim work-related injury.[6] An interpretation of the Act that precludes the award of back pay for this time period is contrary to Congressional intent and would be unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;There are no doubt situations in which the injury suffered by a removed employee is so remote from the circumstances of removal that back pay could not be deemed equal to what "normally would have been earned." A possible example might be one who suffers from a congenital defect that emerges as disabling after a removal action is taken. When it is clear, as in this case, however, that a person would not have sustained an injury had the removal action not been taken, OPM by regulation or otherwise cannot block the statutory right to back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final issue before us is the amount of back pay Martin should be awarded for the period in question. At the same time Martin was pursuing this enforcement action, he was also engaged in a parallel civil suit with the employee who struck him. It is unclear from the record whether the resulting settlement was considered in calculating Martin's net back pay award. The Board should be given the opportunity to address this issue and to determine what part of the settlement is attributable to lost wages, and what part is attributable to damages for physical pain and suffering.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We agree with the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Martin I</span> that only the part of the settlement agreement attributable to lost wages should be included in the offset.</p>
