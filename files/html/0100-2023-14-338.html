<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-339"><span class="space">a.</span> Union Participation</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3434 and NASA Marshall Space Flight Ctr.</span>, 49 FLRA 382, 385 (1994), deemed nonnegotiable a proposal for a union representative on a panel. The proposal was not a negotiable arrangement because it was not tailored to meet a specific adverse impact of the exercise of a management right. That reasoning (although not the precise result) was overruled by <span class="Italic">NTEU and PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 571 (1997), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, 55 FLRA 1233, 1236-37 (2000), reviewing an arbitration award precluding management from unilaterally changing a past practice of permitting union representatives to participate in panels involved in rating, ranking, and interviewing employees for positions within the agency, ascertained that the proposal was a negotiable arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, under certain circumstances, selection panels permitting union participation may be negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 1815 and U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, U.S. Army Aviation Center and Fort Rucker, Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Rucker, Alabama, </span>53 FLRA 606, 615 (1997) (Provision 6); <span class="Italic">cf. National Association of Agriculture Employees and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Hyattsville, Maryland</span>, 48 FLRA 599, 606 (1993) (Proposal 2) (Authority stated that it would not address whether labor-management committee that directly interfered with management's rights was nevertheless an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3), when there was no contention to that effect).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority applies the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, </span>37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>), to determine whether an arbitrator enforced an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Under that framework, the Authority determines whether an award violates management's rights under section 7106 by examining whether the provision of the collective bargaining agreement enforced by the arbitrator: (1) constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, and (2) does not abrogate the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Warner</span> <span class="Italic">Robins Air Force Base, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, </span>53 FLRA 1344, 1348 n.4 (1998) <span class="Italic">(Warner Robins).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A collective bargaining provision constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute if it is intended to provide relief to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a <span id="page_882"></span>management right. <span class="Italic">See BEP, 53 </span>FLRA at 155. The Authority has held that union proposals for selection panels are designed to ameliorate the adverse effects on employees that can result from unfair or inaccurate ratings in the selection process. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees</span> <span class="Italic">Union and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and</span> <span class="Italic">Trademark Office, </span>53 FLRA 539, 569-73 (1997) <span class="Italic">(PTO)</span> (Article 12, Section 4(G)) (provision specifying the qualifications of selection panel members was intended to protect employees by ensuring that they were rated fairly and objectively on their qualifications for performing the work of vacant positions and constituted an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute). Similarly, the Arbitrator in this case enforced a prophylactic measure designed to prevent employees from being harmed by unfair or inaccurate ratings. Such measures come within the purview of section 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See PTO, </span>53 FLRA at 570. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator enforced an arrangement designed to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from management's right to select and assign work. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 569-73.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second part of the <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service </span>test, an award "abrogates" a management right when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" that right. <span class="Italic">Warner Robins, </span>53 FLRA at 1349 (citation omitted). In this case, the Agency argues that the past practice enforced by the Arbitrator is contrary to law because "[a] union presence at any stage of the selection process, and particularly seated on panels, interferes with management's right to assign work and make selections." The Arbitrator found, however, that "[t]he Agency's argument that [the Union's] participation on selection panels interferes with the Agency's reserved rights to assign work and make selections is unpersuasive[,]" and emphasized that "[n]othing in this [o]pinion and [a]ward should be construed as providing the Union the right to make selection decisions." Under the Arbitrator's interpretation, the Agency's past practice does not preclude the Agency from exercising its right, or from choosing not to exercise its right, to assign work and select employees. Rather, the Union's presence on selection panels only gives the Union the right "not to be excluded from the selection process<span class="Italic">...." Id. </span>Based on these factual findings as to the nature of the past practice, the award does not abrogate management's right to assign work and select employees under sections 7106(a)(2)(B) and (C) of the Statute. As such, we find that this portion of the award satisfies Prong 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy, </span>22 FLRA 385. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> the Authority found that a proposal requiring participation of a union representative on a selection panel was nonnegotiable because it would "interfere" with the agency's right to freely engage in discussion and deliberations prior to making decisions involving management rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 386. The Authority has held, however, that negotiability cases employing an "interference" analysis do not control the abrogation analysis required under <span class="Italic">Customs Service. See BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 155 n.9. Similarly, we find that the Agency's cite to <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 5 FLRA 763, is inapplicable to the circumstances presented here. In <span class="Italic">FAA, </span>the Authority found that the arbitrator enforced a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement that constituted an "absolute prohibition" on management's right to take disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 768. Consequently, the Authority held that the award violated section 7106 of the Statu[t]e. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 769. In contrast, the past practice in this case does not preclude the Agency from exercising its rights, and is therefore an enforceable arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under decisions predating <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, a proposal interfered with the right of management to make selections for appointments under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) that provided the union the right to participate at any stage in the ranking process and to have a representative on the ranking panel. The provision allowed the union to participate in the development of selective factors and ranking the candidates. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3488 and FDIC, N.Y. Region</span>, 17 FLRA 538, 540 (1985). A nonnegotiable proposal required management to select one member of a ranking panel from a union-compiled list. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1437 and Army Armament Research, Dev. and Eng'g Ctr., Picatinny Arsenal</span>, 35 FLRA 1052, 1057, 1061 (1990) (Proposal 2). A proposal providing a purely passive union observer of the rating and ranking panels was nonnegotiable, because it interfered with management's right to engage in internal discussion and deliberation prior to making management decisions on selection of employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1815 and Army Aviation Ctr., Ft. Rucker</span>, 53 FLRA 606, 614-15 (1997) (Provision 6); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1437 and Army Armament Research, Dev. and Eng'g Ctr., Picatinny Arsenal</span>, 35 FLRA 1052, 1057 (1990) (Proposal 2) (members of panel selected from list of union nominees would improperly interject union into management's internal deliberative processes); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 85 and VAMC, Leavenworth</span>, 30 FLRA 400, 409-10 (1987) (Proposal 8 nonnegotiable as infringement on right to assign work and to select: "A panel considering candidates for a position encumbered by more than one individual will include one member who currently holds the position."

It was immaterial to its negotiability that a proposal required management to select an observer from a list provided by the union as opposed to an observer directly appointed by the union. <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 100 and DHHS, Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Ctr., Carville</span>, 34 FLRA 704, 704-05 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals requiring promotion panels to be staffed so as to include technical experts in career fields, one to be chosen by the union, were nonnegotiable. Union representatives would participate both in deliberations and discussions concerning the decision to select a particular candidate. The management right to select employees also includes the right to deliberate on and discuss factors relevant to the action to be taken. Union participation in the substantive decisionmaking process directly interfered with the right to make selections for appointments under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C). <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1001 and Dept. of Air Force, Vandenberg AFB</span>, 15 FLRA 804, 809 (1984). A provision setting out the functions and operations of a selecting panel composed of management representatives and a union observer was nonnegotiable because it interfered with the right of the agency to assign work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 78 and VA Reg'l Office, Indianapolis</span>, 9 FLRA 819, 819-20 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l VA Council 53 and VA Clinic, Vista</span>, 58 FLRA 8, 10 (2002), a proposal for a union observer at performance-based interviews infringed upon management's right to make selections for appointments: it was not a negotiable procedure and as an arrangement it was not likely to achieve the objective of reducing the stress of individuals being interviewed. FLRA's position was upheld on judicial review, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l VA Council 53 v. FLRA</span>, 352 F.3d 433, 434-37 (D.C. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The American Federation of Government Employees, National Veterans Affairs Council 53 (Union) petitions for review of a decision of the Federal Labor Relations Board (FLRA, Board) which declared nonnegotiable the Union's proposal to require that the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Vista Clinic (Agency) permit a Union observer to be present at any performance-based interview (PBI) conducted to fill a bargaining unit position.[1] The FLRA concluded that the proposal affects management's right to "make selections for appointments" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C). Because the FLRA's decision is not "'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,'" we deny the petition for review<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-2">When performance-based-interviewing is used for Title 5 bargaining unit positions, the local Union will be given the opportunity for an observer throughout the interviewing process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Nat. VA Council 53</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. 8, 2002 WL 31123857 (2002). The FLRA based its decision that the proposal is not negotiable on three separate determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the FLRA determined the proposal affects the Agency's management rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C), which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Subject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(C)&#x2003;with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from--</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(i) among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion; or</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(ii) any other appropriate source;...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA reasoned that "when conducting PBIs, the Agency is involved in the decision-making process for making selections for appointments" and, in particular, that the Agency "gathers information about the candidates and, based on the information gathered, makes evaluations concerning them." 58 F.L.R.A. at 10. The "information-gathering and evaluative aspects of PBIs," the FLRA explained, "demonstrate that PBIs are an integral part of the 'discussions and deliberations' that lead to selection decisions," 58 F.L.R.A. at 9 (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. 1405, 1442, 1992 WL 126586 (1992)), and the Authority had previously held such "discussions and deliberations" affect management rights, <span class="Italic">see</span> 58 F.L.R.A. at 10 ("The Authority has long held that proposals providing for union participation in 'discussions and deliberations leading to decisions' involving the exercise of management's rights affect those rights.") (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. at 1442 (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1437,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. 1052, 1990 WL 123247 (1990))). Because the information-gathering PBIs are an integral part of the deliberative and decisionmaking process, it was reasonable for the FLRA to conclude that union presence at the PBIs, without management consent, will interfere <span id="page_883"></span>with management's authority to make selections for appointments and therefore to declare the Union's proposal nonnegotiable<span class="Italic">. See Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1745 v. FLRA,</span> 828 F.2d 834, 838 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("We sustain the FLRA in its holding that the right of selection conferred on management by Section 7106(a)(2)(C) extends to the entire selection process, as conducted in accordance with subsections (C)(i) and (ii).").[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We recognize that the PBI itself would not ordinarily include discussions or deliberations by decisionmakers but is instead, as the Authority indicated, designed to elicit information on which such discussions and deliberations, and the selection decision itself, are based. As the Union notes, the Authority's decision cites precedent in which a proposal was found nonnegotiable because it directly interfered with management's discussions and deliberations<span class="Italic">. See Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1437,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. 1052, 1061-62, 1990 WL 123247 (1990) (proposal requiring management to select member of Agency's rating and ranking panel from union-compiled list nonnegotiable). The Authority cites <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1437</span> only to support the underlying principle that under its precedent "discussions and deliberations leading to decisions" are protected under section 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) and not as direct authority for the ultimate determination that PBIs are protected because they form a part of the same deliberative and decisional process. We are unaware of any precedent that extends section 7106(a)(2)(C)'s protection of the process only to discussions and deliberations<span class="Italic">. See Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1437,</span> 35 F.L.R.A. at 1061-62 ("The Authority consistently has held that the exercise of management's rights also <span class="Italic">encompasses actions integral to the exercise of the right, including</span> discussion and deliberation on the relevant factors upon which the decision to act is made.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the FLRA determined that the proposal is not negotiable as a "procedure" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section;....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). As with the management rights determination, the Authority relied on its precedent addressing "discussions and deliberations pertaining to the exercise of management's right [to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C)]," which it has concluded "are not procedures, but concern management's substantive decision-making process." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union,</span> 28 F.L.R.A. 647, 649, 1987 WL 90757 (1987). Again, we find the Authority reasonably applied its precedent to prevent interference with the information-gathering portion of the process. The Union points to other FLRA decisions finding negotiable proposals which allowed union representatives at meetings where employees received "opportunity to improve performance" letters or which required priority consideration in filling vacancies to be given to bargaining unit employees (but which did not require selection of such employees or limit selection to them). In each case, however, the Authority made clear that the subject of the proposal was merely a "procedure" and that it did not affect the substance of the selection process.[3] As we explained above, the proposal here <span class="Italic">does</span> interfere with the selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 3354,</span> 34 F.L.R.A. 919, 926, 1990 WL 120452 (1990) (because performance improvement letter "applies only after the Agency's internal deliberative process concerning application of performance standards has been completed," it "does not permit the Union to interject itself into the Agency's internal deliberations concerning the performance appraisal process"); <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Volunteer Ch. 103,</span> 55 F.L.R.A. 562, 565, 1999 WL 455314 (1999) ("proposal that requires an agency to give first consideration to bargaining unit employees when filling vacant positions, but does not prevent management from timely considering other applicants or expanding the area of consideration once bargaining unit employees are considered, does not directly interfere with management's right to select from any appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C)"); <span class="Italic">Laurel Bay Teachers Ass'n,</span> 49 F.L.R.A. 679, 687 (1994) (same) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. 1405, 1442, 1992 WL 126586 (1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Authority determined that the proposal is not negotiable as an "appropriate arrangement" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). This section provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). In applying this provision, the FLRA first determines whether "an adverse effect is reasonably foreseeable" and if "the disputed proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected"; if so, the Authority then "will examine whether the proposal excessively interferes with management's rights." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R1-100,</span> 39 F.L.R.A. 762, 766, 1991 WL 42218 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 2096,</span> 36 FLRA 834, 841, 1990 WL 155354 (1990)). The Union did not make the threshold showing that the proposal "is in fact intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights" by "articulat[ing] how employees will be detrimentally affected by management's actions and how the matter proposed for bargaining is intended to address or compensate for the actual or anticipated adverse effects of the exercise of the management right or rights." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R14-87,</span> 21 F.L.R.A. 24, 31, 1986 WL 54613 (1986). There is no dispute that any employee is free to have a Union representative present at a PBI if he chooses. Thus, the only effect of the Agency's assertion of its management right by rejecting the infringing proposal is to prevent the Union from demanding that its observer be allowed to be present without regard to the employee's wishes. We do not see how this effect can be characterized as adverse to employees whose choice could otherwise be overridden by the proposal. The Union identifies two adverse effects it asserts will result from conducting a PBI without its representative present: it will add to the stress of those being interviewed and it will increase the likelihood that improper questions will be asked. The Authority reasonably concluded, however, that "for candidates who do not want a Union observer present, such presence would increase stress." The Authority further noted that the Union already has the ability to prevent improper questioning because it "will be provided an advance copy of PBI questions and will be allowed to consult with candidates after PBIs to ensure that appropriate questions were asked." 58 F.L.R.A. at 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the FLRA reasonably declared the Union's proposal to be nonnegotiable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106.</p>
