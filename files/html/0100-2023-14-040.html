<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-41"><span class="space">4.</span> Overtime Assignment, Holiday Work Limitations and Requirements</h4>
<p class="noindent">A provision allowing employees to indicate their interest in overtime work was negotiable. It did not interfere with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2272 and DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span>, 9 FLRA 1004, 1009 (1982). But overtime assignments need not follow democratic principles. <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU and VAMC, Dept. of Memorial Affairs</span>, 40 FLRA 657, 675-77 (1991), considered nonnegotiable Provision 5, calling on management to agree that Saturday overtime would begin at a particular time unless a majority vote of employees approved a different time.</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonnegotiable proposal required that employees may be requested to perform a reasonable amount of overtime during a week. It limited management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1622 and Commissary, Ft. Meade</span>, 16 FLRA 998, 998-99 (1984). Another proposal was nonnegotiable that prevented management from assigning additional work to unit employees unless it could be established that the work could not be accomplished without overtime or temporary augmentation of the workforce. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-89 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Army Air Defense Ctr.</span>, 15 FLRA 14, 14-15 (1984). The right to assign work was infringed by a proposal that mandatory overtime be limited to emergency situations. <span class="Italic">NFFE Council of Consol. SSA Locals and SSA</span>, 13 FLRA 422, 423 (1983). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 85 and VAMC, Leavenworth</span>, 30 FLRA 400, 405-06 (1987), determined to be nonnegotiable restrictions on overtime assignment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 5</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Article XV-overtime</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Section 6.</span> Emergency overtime shall not be compulsory, except when official requirements must be met. If overtime is necessary, available volunteers will be asked first. If sufficient volunteers are not available or no volunteers, reverse seniority shall be used. Failure of the employer to properly notify the employee of overtime requirements shall relieve the employee of the obligation to work overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of this proposal is to the same effect as Provision 8 in <span class="Italic">International Plate Printers, Die Stampers and Engravers Union of North America, AFL-CIO, Local 2 and Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C</span>., 25 FLRA 113 (1987). Provision 8 provided that overtime would not be assigned on a compulsory basis unless there were unusually heavy workloads. We found that the provision prevented management from assigning overtime work to particular employees under certain circumstances. Similarly, the first sentence of this proposal prevents management from requiring employees to work overtime in all but one circumstance. Thus, based on <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, we find this sentence to be outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next two sentences, read together, provide that overtime will be assigned first to volunteers and then, if insufficient volunteers exist, to nonvolunteers based on inverse seniority. It is well established that the right to assign work includes the right to determine the particular qualifications and skills necessary to perform the work and the right to make judgments in determining whether particular employees meet those qualifications. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Fort Knox Dependent Schools</span>. It also is clear that proposals which provide a procedure for selecting the particular employee who will perform the work from a group of employees who are determined to be qualified are negotiable. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span> (Provisions 5 and 9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, there is nothing in the language of the proposal or in the record which indicates that management would be able to make qualification determinations when assigning overtime. Rather, the second and third sentences would result in overtime being assigned solely according to the requirements set out in those sentences. Thus, by precluding management from taking into account valid considerations in making overtime assignments, the second and third sentences are inconsistent with management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(B) to assign work. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 32 and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 26 FLRA 612 (1987) (Proposal 3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the last sentence of this proposal infringes on management's right to assign work because it limits management's ability to assign overtime work. The last sentence removes an employee's obligation to perform the assigned overtime duties unless he or she had been notified in advance. By so doing this sentence deprives the Agency of its right to assign work unless the required notification had taken place. Consequently, this sentence infringes on management's right and is, thus, outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span> (Provision 8).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that overtime for nurses be used only if necessary functions could not be performed through planned coverage during their regular basic workweek. <span class="Italic">VA Staff Nurses Council, Local 5032 and VAMC, Wood</span>, 29 FLRA 849, 861-62 (1987) (Proposal 7); <span class="Italic">see AFGE Local 1658 and Dept. of Army, Army Tank-Automotive Command</span>, 44 FLRA 1375, 1384-86 (1992) (nonnegotiable portions of Provision 7: precluding assignment of overtime unless it concerned "mission-related emergencies," or if it required employees to perform duties below their grade levels). It was immaterial that the proposal was similar to agency regulations. A requirement that an agency not require a teacher to attend after-hours PTA meetings was nonnegotiable.

<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">ACT Granite State Chap. And DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, 55 FLRA 476, 478-79 (1999), was a proposal that, unavoidable inequalities aside, no greater overtime will be involuntarily assigned to unit employees during any calendar year than is involuntarily assigned to available and similarly qualified nonunit personnel. The nonunit employees included Active Guard Reserve personnel, as to whom, the agency argued, the proposal would effectively establish the working conditions for military personnel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that "the military aspects of civilian technician employment" are not subject to negotiation. <span class="Italic">ACT-Montana</span>, 20 FLRA at 739.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As interpreted, the proposal does not prevent the Agency from assigning AGR members or unit employees to any particular task at any particular time. Rather, it seeks to limit the amount of involuntary overtime required of unit employees over the course of a calendar year, as compared with involuntary overtime worked by non-unit personnel. Consequently, the proposal does not regulate the assignment of overtime work to non-unit personnel, but addresses the inequality of involuntary overtime assignments to bargaining unit employees. Thus, the proposal does not require the Agency to negotiate on behalf of the United States concerning the terms of service of military personnel in violation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976I. That statutory provision prohibits any member of the armed forces or any civilian officer or employer from negotiating on behalf of the United States with anyone representing, or purporting to represent, members of the armed forces concerning the conditions of military service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Civilian Technicians, Pennsylvania State Council and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Adjutant General of Pennsylvania, Fort Indiantown Gap, Annville, Pennsylvania,</span> 54 FLRA 552, 557-58 (1998) (proposal requiring agency to alter its method of filling vacancies did not require the agency to select AGR candidates for any particular position and, therefore, did not require the agency to negotiate on behalf of the United States concerning the terms of service of military personnel in violation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976I). That the proposal may affect non-unit personnel, AGR members, does not, in and of itself, constitute a violation of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that directly determines the conditions of employment of non-unit employees, including supervisors, is outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of State, County &#x0026; Municipal Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2910 and Library of Congress, </span>53 FLRA 1334, 1338 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>), citing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point and American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1997) <span class="Italic">(AFGE I). </span>However, the fact that a proposal affects non-unit employees' conditions of employment is not sufficient to remove it from the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id.; International Federation</span> <span class="Italic">of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 35 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard,</span> <span class="Italic">Portsmouth, Virginia, </span>54 FLRA 1377, 1381 (1998) <span class="Italic">(Department of the Navy). </span>In this regard, "[n]early every bargaining proposal, if accepted, will have some effect on non-unit personnel." <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>, 53 FLRA at 1338 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, 110 F.3d at 815). That a proposal has an indirect effect on non-unit employees may relate to its reasonableness or merits, but does not render the proposal outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE I and Cherry Point</span>). <span id="page_647"></span>Accordingly, proposals that directly implicate the working conditions of unit employees, and that are otherwise within the duty to bargain, are not removed from the duty simply because they also affect non-unit employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, nothing on the face of the proposal indicates a direct effect on non-unit personnel. The Union's proposal would only require the Agency to assign bargaining unit members the same or less involuntary overtime than it assigned to non-bargaining unit persons. It would not directly determine the amount of involuntary overtime that non-unit personnel (the AGR members) would be required to perform. Although the proposal may well result in additional overtime work for AGR members, that effect is not enough to lead to the conclusion that the proposal directly determines the conditions of employment of non-unit personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Library of Congress, </span>53 FLRA at 1338-39 (although a proposal requiring an agency to provide a proportionate number of parking spaces to unit employees would reduce the number of spaces available to non-unit employees, that effect was not sufficient to remove the proposal from the agency's duty to bargain); <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, </span>54 FLRA at 1381-82 (the fact that a proposal that designated the location of an agency restaurant also affected non-unit personnel, such as military personnel, did not remove the proposal from the scope of bargainable conditions of employment and did not implicate the vitally affects test). In this regard, where a proposal does not directly determine the conditions of employment of nonunit personnel, the vitally affects test is not implicated. As such, we do not determine whether in this case the proposal vitally affects the conditions of employment of unit employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">id. </span>At 1382.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the proposal does not directly determine the terms or conditions of service of AGR members, it is within the duty to bargain unless it is removed from the duty for some reason other than the effect of the proposal on AGR members. Other than the assertion that the proposal is inconsistent with 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976, the Agency presented no further reason for finding the proposal outside the duty to bargain. For the reasons discussed at the beginning of this section, that argument lacks merit. Accordingly, we conclude that the proposal is within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA approved arrangements bargaining on a proposal that overtime normally be scheduled in eight-hour blocks on Saturdays. The purpose of the proposal was to avoid exhaustion of employees involved in manual labor, <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU and VAMC, Dept. of Memorial Affairs</span>, 40 FLRA 657, 671-74 (1991) (Provision 4):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to the question of whether Provision 4 constitutes an "appropriate arrangement" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As noted above, in order to determine whether a proposal is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights, we look to "the effects or foreseeable effects on employees which flow from the exercise of those rights, and how those effects are adverse." <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA at 31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Provision 4 is intended to lessen the effects on employees, during the regular workweek, of having to perform hard physical work beyond the normal 8-hour shifts. The Union also states that "work beyond the 8-hour shift is potentially dangerous to employees because of exhaustion." Provision 4, therefore, is intended to ameliorate the adverse effects on employees of more than 8 hours of hard physical work in a regular workday by providing that overtime will normally be performed in 8-hour blocks on Saturday. We reject the Agency's contention that there are no adverse effects on employees flowing from the assignment of overtime....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that Provision 4 constitutes an arrangement, it is necessary to determine whether the arrangement is "appropriate."... An arrangement is appropriate if it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of a management right under section 7106 of the Statute. As noted above, in making this determination we consider whether the negative impact on management's right to assign work is disproportionate to the benefits conferred on employees by the provision....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 4 would ameliorate the adverse effects on employees of being required to do more than 8 hours of physical labor by requiring the Agency "normally" to postpone work which could not be completed during the regular workday until it could be scheduled in an 8-hour block on Saturday. We interpret the term "normally" to mean that the Agency would not be precluded from requiring employees to work overtime where that would be necessary to complete work by a given deadline or to complete a particular task. We conclude, therefore, that the effect of the provision is to require the Agency to delay the completion of overtime work which does not need to be finished at any particular time until it can be completed during an 8-hour overtime workday on a Saturday. Moreover, the provision would not delay the completion of the overtime work indefinitely if circumstances such as inclement weather preclude doing the work on Saturday, but would permit the agency to schedule the work in addition to the regular workday during the following week. The issue is whether the benefit to employees of the delay in overtime work required by the provision outweighs the effect of that delay on management's ability to schedule and complete work assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[B]y requiring only that overtime work "normally" be scheduled in 8-hour blocks on Saturday, the provision affords the Agency flexibility in scheduling overtime that must be completed by a given time. Moreover, the Agency has not offered any evidence which is inconsistent with the Union's specific claim that the overtime work that is usually performed by the employees in this case is the physically demanding work of setting headstones....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based upon the foregoing and taking into account the Union's undisputed contention that the provision reflects the Agency's existing practice as to the scheduling of overtime, we conclude that the burden imposed on management's ability to schedule and complete work on overtime does not outweigh the benefit to employees of that practice in alleviating the physical demands of the overtime work. Consequently, we find that Provision 4 does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work and conclude that the provision is a negotiable appropriate arrangement...</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable procedure called on the agency to agree that when overtime is required on Saturdays and Sundays for a continuing period, the employee normally will not be required to work two consecutive weekends. Management retained the right both to determine when overtime was required and to identify the employees who were qualified to perform the work. Nothing allowed employees to refuse to perform overtime. <span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC and Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 31 FLRA 131, 137-39 (1988) (Provision 5). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and DOD Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Sch.,</span> 64 FLRA 953, 959-60 (2010), resolved as negotiable arrangements Provisions 6 and 7, calling for equitable distribution of overtime, compensatory time, and school extracurricular duty assignments for teachers. The proposal mitigated adverse effects on employees of assignment of too much, or too little, overtime work and extracurricular duties; the agency did not challenge those effects; the proposals were sufficiently tailored; the proposals permitted management to determine whether employees were qualified to perform work; the agency failed to demonstrate that the provisions excessively interfered with management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonnegotiable proposal provided that employees called back to work outside of their regular hours of duty be excused on completion of the task that required their callback. It directly interfered with the right to assign work of equal or greater importance to the employee that the agency might need to have performed immediately. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Dependent Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 493, 504-05 (1987). A proposal that management assign overtime prior to leaving any post vacant, emergencies excepted, infringed management's right to assign work. No argument was advanced supporting the proposal as a negotiable arrangement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1302 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons</span>, 55 FLRA 1078, 1079 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that permitted certain employees to be scheduled for overtime assignments, even if the assignments resulted in employees working 16-hour shifts. FLRA became involved in a discussion of the physical effects of overtime work and concluded that management had not demonstrated that employees working the long shifts would be unable to perform their work. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth FEMTC and Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 31 FLRA 1006, 1007-08 (1988) (the disputed portion of the proposal was: "[t]he Employer further agrees that it will not be its practice to deny an employee the opportunity to 16 hour shifts." In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1041-43 (1988), FLRA declared nonnegotiable a proposal, Provision 13, that employees not be required to work combinations of straight time and overtime exceeding 12 hours in a day. FLRA brushed aside the union's explanations of the need for the proposal to ameliorate adverse effects of long workdays, i.e., problems related to child care, transportation, and fatigue, with the observation that these intrusions were mitigated by the premium pay the employees received. Allowing the proposal, FLRA reasoned, restricted the agency's ability to meet work Needs and the need to assign employees with particular skills to work when their skills were needed.</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal called on management to relieve an employee, on request, from an overtime assignment if another qualified employee was available for assignment and willing to work. If management determined that two or more employees are equally qualified to perform a task, the selection of any of those employees is consistent with management's discretion to assign work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1622 and Commissary, Ft. Meade</span>, 16 FLRA 998, 999-1000 (1984). The reasoning of <span class="Italic">Local 1622</span> was extended to a negotiable proposal that if there are too few overtime volunteers, the agency, using inverse seniority, may require overtime work of qualified employees, including apprentices, capable of doing the work. The proposal also permitted an employee to refuse overtime for a "legitimate reason" if the agency could secure a replacement who was both available and qualified to perform the work. It was not, however, negotiable to permit an employee flatly to refuse overtime assignments. <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 118-20 (1987) (Provisions 5 and 9; Provision 6). A proposal was not <span id="page_648"></span>bargainable that precluded the employer from disciplining employees who could not be contacted for overtime work through no fault of their own: the proposal was too broad and might preclude discipline of employees who were "on-call." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1815 and Army Aviation Ctr., Ft. Rucker</span>, 28 FLRA 1172, 1175 (1987) (Provision 3).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal infringed the right to assign work because it precluded the employer from requiring overtime of employees who felt that it would affect their efficiency, health, or emotional stability. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2094 and VAMC, New York, N.Y.</span>, 22 FLRA 710, 715-16 (1986) (Proposal 4). Despite that determination, FLRA approved a proposal in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1631 and VAMC, Chillichothe</span>, 25 FLRA 366, 370 (1987) (Provision 2), seeking management's agreement that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Overtime, whether scheduled or unscheduled, will be fairly and equitably assigned, first, to qualified volunteers, if available and/or time permits; or second, in the event no volunteers are available, fairly and equitably assigned to those available with the requisite skills, except that overtime should not be required of employees when it will impair their health or efficiency or cause extreme hardship to them.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of that proposal, FLRA decided, 25 FLRA at 371-72:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2 is to the same as [sic] effect as Provision 2 in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1622 and U.S. Commissary, Fort Meade, Maryland</span>, 16 FLRA 998 (1984). Provision 2 in that case required that the employer would, upon request, relieve an employee from an overtime assignment if there was another qualified employee available and willing to work. The Authority held that the provision did not interfere with management's rights...but instead constituted a negotiable procedure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's contention, there is nothing in the record which indicates that this provision would require management to assign work outside of an employee's normal job responsibilities. Instead, the clear language of the disputed provision refers to "qualified" volunteers and requires other employees to have the requisite skills for the job. If, in the Agency's judgment, a volunteer is not qualified and capable of performing the work, management would retain the right to assign overtime work to another employee which it determined had the requisite skills....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Agency did not specifically address the last clause of the portion of Provision 2 in dispute which provides that "except that overtime should not be required of employees when it will impair their health or effeciency [sic] or cause extreme hardship to them." This clause expressly provides that overtime <span class="Italic">should</span> not be assigned in the circumstances described and does not actually prevent the Agency from assigning overtime in those circumstances. Thus, since there is nothing in the express language of Provision 2 assigning overtime in the circumstances described and since the Agency has made no claim concerning this clause, we will interpret this portion of Provision 2 as being consistent with management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2354 and Air Force 90th CSG, Warren AFB</span>, 30 FLRA 1130, 1136-37 (1988), approved Provision 3, requiring that overtime be excused or modified when, in the judgment of agency medical authorities, assignment of overtime would endanger an employee's health or safety. The provision was a negotiable procedure in accordance with the analysis in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1625 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Oceana</span>, 30 FLRA 1105 (1988) (discussed as to negotiability of light duty assignments). Negotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 405 and Dept. of Army, Army Info. Sys. Command, St. Louis</span>, 42 FLRA 1112, 1136 (1991), was Proposal 23 (Article 16, Overtime, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3a and 3c):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees shall not be required to work under the following conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;When unable to work for medical reasons, continuing or prolonged medical conditions will be certified in writing....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">c.&#x2003;If the employee has a justifiable emergency or unavoidable personal situation.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained, 42 FLRA at 1137-40:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work encompasses the assignment of work which is performed on overtime.... Further, the Authority has held that proposals which limit management's right to assign overtime work directly interfere with that right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 3a and 3c, read in conjunction with the introductory wording "[e]mployees shall not be required to work[,]" prevent the Agency from assigning an employee overtime when the employee is "unable to work for medical reasons" or has "a justifiable emergency or unavoidable personal situation." By preventing management from assigning overtime in these situations, sections 3a and 3c directly interfere with management's right to assign work. Consequently, Proposal 23 is nonnegotiable unless it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that Proposal 23 is intended to excuse an employee from working overtime when "certain compelling personal circumstances are present." Section 3a, the Union asserts, "seems only logical" because it would excuse an employee from work when he or she is unable to work for medical reasons. Section 3c is intended, according to the Union, to relieve an employee from overtime if the employee has a justifiable emergency or unavoidable personal situation. Based on the Union's statements, we find that sections 3a and 3c are intended to ameliorate the effect of management's right to assign overtime and, therefore, they constitute arrangements within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 3a would benefit employees by excusing them from overtime work when they are unable to work for medical reasons.&#x2003;It is reasonably foreseeable that if employees are ill or injured, section 3a would contribute to employees' improved health and decrease the possibility that they would aggravate injuries. Furthermore, because employees would not be working when they are ill or injured, employees' work would be less likely to be evaluated as unsatisfactory. Similarly, section 3c would benefit employees who are unable to work overtime because of personal reasons. This section lessens the possibility that employees would be disciplined for their failure to report for duty when situations occur that are unavoidable or beyond their control. Sections 3a and 3c, we conclude, would provide significant benefits to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, sections 3a and 3c would prevent the assignment of overtime in certain circumstances. Section 3a restricts management's right to assign overtime when employees are unable to work for medical reasons. It is unclear from the wording of section 3a whether management may require that all medical reasons be certified in writing or whether certification is limited to "continuing or prolonged" medical conditions. In this regard, the Union asserts that "[t]he proposal itself allows [m]anagement to insist on medical documentation." Consistent with the Union's assertion, which is not limited to continuing or prolonged medical conditions, we find that, under section 3a, management may require medical certification whenever employees assert that they cannot work for medical reasons. It follows, in our view, that management may refuse to excuse employees from overtime assignments when such medical certification is not supplied or does not demonstrate that, under the proposal, employees are "unable to work for medical reasons."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's ability to require medical certification does not eliminate the proposal's direct interference with the Agency's right to assign work.... However, the Agency's ability to require the submission of, and review of the sufficiency of, medical documentation mitigates the effect on the Agency's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to section 3c, we reject the Agency's claim that it "totally" bans overtime assignments if an employee has a justifiable emergency or unavoidable personal situation. Nothing in section 3c prevents management from deciding whether an emergency is justifiable or a personal situation is unavoidable. Finally, we note the Union's argument: "what legitimate interest could the Agency have in assigning work to an employee who is unable to work for medical reasons, or who has a justifiable emergency or unavoidable personal situation?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the significant benefits that employees would gain from sections 3a and 3c outweigh the burden on management's right to assign overtime work. In reaching this conclusion, we note, particularly, that management retains the right to determine the adequacy of the medical documentation and whether an employee has a justifiable emergency or an unavoidable personal situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that section 3a is an appropriate arrangement, we reject the Agency's argument that section 3a is nonnegotiable because it does not provide that medical certification will "be accomplished by the base medical authority...." In <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 36 FLRA at 839, we held that although proposals which require an agency to observe medical restrictions independent of those imposed by its own authorities directly interfere with management's right to assign work, they may be considered as arrangements under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we find that Proposal 23, sections 3a and 3c do not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to assign work and are negotiable appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonbargainable proposal required employees on call-back overtime to be released from duty when they had completed the specific task necessitating their call back. It limited the right of the agency to assign work during an emergency. It was not an appropriate arrangement, because it excessively interfered with the right of the agency to assign work that the agency legitimately needed to have performed while the employee was on call-back status. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2317 and Marine Corps Logistics Base, Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality, Albany</span>, 29 FLRA 1587, 1596-97 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 53 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Material Transp.

A proposal was proper for bargaining that management limit overtime assignments to FLSA-exempt employees, to the extent possible, so that they would not exceed earnings caps imposed under the Federal Employees Pay Act, 5 USC 5547. The agency was not precluded from assigning overtime under the limitations of the provision if no other qualified employee was available. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 3 and Naval Sea Sys. Command Detachment</span>, 25 FLRA 714, 715-16 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Holiday work could not be demanded so as to force the employer to pay overtime rates. Ruled nonnegotiable was a proposal that employees not be scheduled to work on a holiday set by federal law or executive order solely to avoid overtime work that would otherwise be performed on a day outside the basic workweek. The proposal infringed the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1815 and Army Aviation Ctr., Ft. Rucker</span>, 28 FLRA 1172, 1175-76 (1987) (Provision 4). A similar proposal was not an appropriate arrangement because it had a disproportionately negative impact on management's right to assign work compared to the benefits derived by employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2298 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Resale Activity, Navy Exch., Naval Weapons Station, Charleston</span>, 35 FLRA 1128, 1130-31 (1990) (Proposal 1) (relying on <span class="Italic">IAM, Local 726 and Naval Air Rework Facility, North Island</span>, 31 FLRA 158, 169 (1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Some negotiation is permissible concerning avoidance of overtime by management and scheduling of holiday work. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot</span>, 44 FLRA 738, 742, 744-46 (1992), decided as partially negotiable Provision 2: "The Employer agrees that employees will not have their tour of duty changed to work on holidays to avoid paying overtime." FLRA explained that, for a group of NAF employees not subject to 5 CFR 610.121, the proposal constituted an appropriate arrangement, even though it interfered with management's right to assign work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also held that proposals that preclude management from changing work schedules to avoid the payment of overtime are inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, a Government-wide regulation and, therefore, are nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 85 and Veterans Administration, Medical Center, Leavenworth, Kansas</span>, 30 FLRA 400, 413-14 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Medical Center, Leavenworth</span>); <span class="Italic">Tidewater Virginia Federal Employees Metal Trades Council and Department of the Navy, Navy Public Works Center, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, 25 FLRA 3, 5-7 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Navy Public Works Center</span>). The Authority held that the proposals in those cases would prevent management from changing work schedules to avoid the payment of overtime even where management determined, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, that the Agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased if it did not change work schedules to avoid the payment of overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2 would preclude management from scheduling employees to work on a holiday in order to avoid the payment of overtime.&#x2003;Provision 2 is broadly worded and would preclude management from changing work schedules to avoid the payment of overtime even where management determines, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, that the Agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased if it did not change work schedules to avoid the payment of overtime. Consequently, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">Medical Center, Leavenworth</span> and <span class="Italic">Navy Public Works Center</span>, that Provision 2 is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note in this connection the Union's statement that Provision 2 is intended to apply to NAF employees. Some, but not all, NAF employees are subject to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121.

Although the Union claims that the provision applies to NAF employees, the Union does not indicate, and there is no basis in the record for determining, whether those employees are NAF employees who are subject to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that Provision 2 applies to NAF employees who are subject to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, it is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute. Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to address the Union's contention that Provision 2 is an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. We do not reach an appropriate arrangement issue when, as in this case, a proposal or a provision is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 79, 88 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that Provision 2 applies to NAF employees who are not subject to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, the negotiability of the provision depends upon resolution of the Union's claim that the provision is an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, we determine whether the proposal is: (1) intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's right.... We determine whether a proposal excessively interferes with a management right by weighing the benefits of the proposal to unit employees against the burden on management's rights imposed by the proposal.... We conclude that Provision 2 does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that Provision 2 is an arrangement for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work. Specifically, the Union argues that employees whose workweek is changed so as to include a holiday in their normal workweek and to require them to work on that holiday are adversely affected by the loss of their usual day off work as well as the loss of overtime pay that they would otherwise receive. Provision 2 is intended to alleviate the adverse effects on employees of such changes in work schedules by restricting management's right to schedule work on holidays so as to avoid the payment of overtime. We conclude that Provision 2 is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2 would benefit employees by ensuring that they will not have their tour of duty changed by being scheduled to work on a holiday in order to avoid the payment of overtime.&#x2003;Provision 2 would not preclude management from changing work schedules to assign work to employees on a holiday so long as management's decision to change the workweek was not based solely on the avoidance of overtime. Management retains the right to assign work, specifically to assign work on a holiday. In short, the burden imposed on the Agency by the provision is that it will not be able to schedule work solely to avoid the payment of overtime for work on a holiday.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Provision 2, employees have the benefits of: (1) knowing that they will not have their tour of duty changed to work on a scheduled holiday in order to avoid the payment of overtime; and (2) receiving overtime pay for working on a holiday outside their normal workweek. Management still retains the right to assign employees work on the holiday. The only restriction on the exercise of that right is the requirement that management not change the employees' tour of duty to avoid paying overtime for work on the holiday. When the benefits to employees set forth above are balanced against the restriction on management's ability to change employees' schedules to avoid paying overtime for work on a holiday, we find that the benefits to employees outweigh the burden on management's right to assign work. Consequently, insofar as the provision applies to NAF employees who are not subject to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, we find that the provision is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
