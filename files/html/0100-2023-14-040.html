<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-41"><span class="space">a.</span> By Agency; Decision Notice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no requirement that the agency's decision notice itself contain specific, detailed information demonstrating that the deciding official considered the relevant mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">See Wynne v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 127, 135 (1997). However, if the record evidence does not show that the agency deciding official considered any specific, relevant mitigating factors before selecting a penalty, his penalty selection is not entitled to Board deference. The Board then independently weighs the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to assess the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Wynne v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 127, 135 (1997); <span class="Italic">Gmitro v. Dept. of Army</span>, 95 MSPR 89, 92 &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (if the Board independently assesses the penalty because the agency deciding official failed to consider a specific, relevant mitigating factor, and, making that determination, the Board determines the agency's penalty to be unreasonable, the Board then mitigates the penalty to the maximum reasonably penalty); <span class="Italic">cf. Adams v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 112 MSPR 288, 298 &#x00B6; 22, 2009 MSPB 185 (2009) (failure of the deciding official to testify did not impair the agency cases when the decision letter incorporated by reference the mitigation analysis contained in the removal proposal). <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210812139">8 F.4th 1290</a>, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2021), said of the deciding official's responsibility to consider mitigating factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with the government's argument is that a penalty may be overturned not only because it is unreasonable on its face by being "unconscionably disproportionate" to the offense, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987), but also because the deciding official did not weigh the relevant factors bearing on the appropriateness of the penalty, including the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Higgins</span>, 955 F.3d at 1353. <span class="Italic">See also Koester v. U.S. Park Police</span>, 758 F. App'x 925, 929-31 (Fed. Cir. 2019) ("We review arbitration decisions [under the same standards as if reviewing a decision from the Board]....There is no reason to believe that the arbitrator failed to consider or independently assess any relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor. Moreover, the Park Police's removal penalty is not so harsh and grossly or unconsciously disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion for the arbitrator to have considered it reasonable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> the agency final decision notice shows that the agency considered all relevant circumstances in reaching its decision to impose specific disciplinary action, the decision will be entitled to more deference by the Board than a decision that contains no explanation of the factors leading to the penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Littledyke v. USDA</span>, 6 MSPR 430, 432-33, 6 MSPB 365 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Poczkalski v. Dept. of Interior,</span> SF-0752-09-0886-I-1 (NP 7/2/2010) ("In this case, the administrative judge noted that the agency's decision letter contained a detailed analysis of the relevant and material aggravating and mitigating factors, and she summarized the deciding official's testimony regarding his penalty determination. ...Overall, the record shows that the deciding official was aware of and conscientiously considered all of the relevant factors which were applicable to this case."); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. GSA</span>, 82 MSPR <span id="Page_2333"></span>259, 263 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (sufficient that "[t]he decision letter state[d] that there were 'no mitigating factors sufficient to outweigh, under these circumstances, a proposal of removal and [to] justify a lesser penalty.'"); <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 425, 432-33 (1994) (agency decision letter failed to specify a consideration of mitigating factors, and the deciding official's testimony did not show a consideration of relevant mitigating factors, so it fell to the Board to undertake a mitigation analysis of factors claimed by the appellant to be relevant to mitigation); <span class="Italic">Daniels v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 272, 285 (1993) (as to an agency that did not describe its consideration of mitigating factors in the proposal or decision letters, it was up to the Board to determine the reasonableness of the penalty through notes of the reply session, or through testimony of the deciding official at the hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency decision letter need not contain an explicit recitation of reasons that might detract from the penalty determination, as opposed to reasons for taking the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Ahr v. DOJ</span>, 23 MSPR 238, 242 (1984). <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 502, 506 (1993), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erred in concluding that the deciding official inadequately considered mitigation because he did not specifically mention the apparent lack of a prior record of sexual misconduct on the part of the appellant. It is not a deciding official's responsibility to provide a list of every circumstance that might have caused him to adopt a lesser penalty.... Rather, the deciding official is only required to consider all of the relevant mitigating factors that actually exist in a given case and exercise management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Spearman v. United States Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 135, 141 (1990)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ is to rely upon agency consideration of mitigating factors and agency officials do not testify as to the scope of their review of the penalty, the AJ does not have leave to surmise whether mitigating factors were conscientiously considered by the agency, <span class="Italic">Banez v. DOD</span>, 69 MSPR 642, 649-50 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In imposing the penalty of removal, contrary to the administrative judge's assertion, the agency does not appear to have considered the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981). The administrative judge quoted from the proposal notice in determining that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors had been considered; however, the question is whether the agency's deciding official considered such factors. In the final decision letter of January 24, 1995, Commissary Officer Charles J. Blackburn states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As the Deciding Official, it is my responsibility to review all the evidence available and provide you a written decision. After judiciously, reviewing and considering all pertinent facts and available information, including your oral reply, it is my determination to remove you from Federal Service for the efficiency of the government. Accordingly, be advised that your removal is effective close of business January 24, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, this statement does not necessarily evidence consideration of the mitigating factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> and is equivocal in that regard. Also, the record contains other evidence that despite its guidelines permitting a penalty of a 14-day suspension to removal for a first offense of theft, the agency may, in fact, have a policy of not considering alternative sanctions to removal, <span class="Italic">see</span> the agency's memorandum advising Commissary employees that they could be liable for dismissal even for a first offense of theft, signed by the appellant on November 2, 1993.... We note also the proposed removal notice that states: "it is DCA policy that any employee found to have engaged in theft and/or misappropriation of government property or related offenses is liable for dismissal." Thus, we find that the agency has not shown that it gave substantive consideration to a lesser penalty and to the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Where the agency has failed to balance the relevant factors, the Board has held that it may do so without deference to the agency-imposed penalty....</p>

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 109 MSPR 301, 306-07 &#x00B6; 11, 2008 MSPB 151 (2008) (deciding official's statement in the adverse action decision that he considered all relevant factors raised during the reply did not convince the Board that a proper <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis was conducted, a conclusion buttressed by evidence that the deciding official effectively testified that he had no discretion relative to the level of the penalty for an offense relating to the responsibility of an IRS employee as a taxpayer); <span class="Italic">Toth v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 36, 39 (1997) (no deference to a removal penalty for the nondelivery of mail when the agency's deciding official considered nothing less than removal and stated that removal was the only appropriate penalty for throwing away mail); <span class="Italic">Wynne v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 127, 134-35 (1997) (agency penalty received no deference when the decision letter made a passing reference to the consideration of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, but the record did not demonstrate the specific mitigating factors considered by the deciding official). <span class="Italic">But see Lewis v. GSA</span>, 82 MSPR 259, 264 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (noting that in <span class="Italic">Wynne</span>, "lack of discussion by deciding official as to why lesser penalty was inappropriate did not, in itself, warrant mitigation").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may demonstrate through means other than the decision letter that they have carefully considered mitigating factors, <span class="Italic">Mertins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 157, 160 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here is no requirement in 5 USC 7513(b)(4), in 5 CFR 752.404(f), or in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> that written agency decisions or proposals contain specific, detailed information demonstrating that the agency has considered all of the pertinent mitigating factors in a given case. Whether the agency has selected a reasonable penalty is a question of proof. In meeting its burden on this issue, the agency is not, after all, limited to these letters.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some agencies use checklists or worksheets that enumerate the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Deciding officials tick off the various points that they have considered, or provide narrative descriptions of what they have considered as to various potential points of mitigation, and they then sign the forms. The forms become part of the adverse action record that is placed before the Board. That a deciding official does not sign a form does not diminish the weight the Board will give to testimony by the deciding official that mitigating factors were considered. <span class="Italic">See Casteel v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 97 MSPR 521, 525-26 &#x00B6; 10 (2004); <span class="Italic">cf. Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 23 MSPR 554, 557 (1984) ("The agency's act of reconsidering the penalty is in and of itself some evidence that the agency officials conscientiously considered the relevant factors and attempted to strike a responsible balance within the limits of reasonableness.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One means of presenting evidence of agency deliberations is at the Board hearing. <span class="Italic">Wright v. FAA</span>, 31 MSPR 473, 475-76 (1986), considered what evidence concerning the reasonableness of the penalty must be presented by the agency during the adverse action hearing. The deciding official (who was also the proposing official) apparently testified, but said nothing about the selection of the penalty or consideration of mitigating factors. The appellant moved for and was granted summary judgment for failure of the agency to make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reasonableness of the penalty. On the agency's PFR, the Board remanded; the AJ should have allowed the agency the opportunity to provide evidence opposing the motion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>...the Board stated that an agency may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case supporting the appropriateness of its penalty by presenting evidence of the facts on which selection of the penalty was based, a concise statement of its reasoning from those facts or information otherwise to show that its reasoning is not on its face inherently irrational, and by showing that the penalty conforms to law or regulation. When no issue has been raised concerning the penalty, such a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case will normally suffice to meet the agency's burden. After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the agency has presented evidence of probative value sufficient to establish an unimpeached <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The witness' testimony that he issued the proposal to remove the appellant for the reasons stated in the notice, plus two documents that the agency intended, but did not have the opportunity, to introduce [an employment program and the appellant's position description, documents the Board noted addressed the question of what action may be taken against an employee who fails to progress through a training program], constitute at least some evidence in support of the agency's chosen penalty. Appellant failed to introduce any evidence to impeach either the witness' testimony or the documents, and therefore failed to show that the agency had not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Although the presiding official gave the agency representative an opportunity to spontaneously respond to the appellant's motion, the presiding official did not permit full evidentiary development of the issue since he did not "call upon" the agency representative to submit such further evidence as he deemed necessary to rebut the appellant's challenge [the motion was made and granted before the agency had completed the presentation of its case-in-chief].... Therefore, it is unreasonable for the appellant, having surprised the agency with a motion challenging the penalty, to then suggest that the record should reflect proof the same as the agency would have offered had it known in advance of the challenge....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official further erred by reversing the action after he concluded that the agency had not considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. He should have allowed both parties to present evidence and argument before determining whether the charges were sustained. If they were, and if he then still concluded that the agency had failed to support its choice of penalty, he was required to "specify how the agency's decision should be corrected to bring the penalty within the parameters of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Douglas, supra</span>, at 306.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board takes into account the deciding official's failure thoroughly to consideration mitigating factors, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-14-0816-I-1 (NP 1/19/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge's implicit conclusion that the deciding official's evaluation of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors was lacking and that the agency had not proven the reasonableness of the removal penalty. We have reviewed the decision letter, which contains a cursory review of some of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, and the deciding official's testimony. The decision letter recites that the deciding official considered the appellant's length of service and lack of prior discipline as mitigating factors. However, the deciding official appeared to admit in his testimony that he did not consider, in the context of the proper penalty for the submitting false reports charge, the appellant's job level, record of experience, length of service, lack of prior discipline, ability to <span id="Page_2334"></span>get along with her coworkers, and any stress, job tensions, or personality issues. The deciding official's failure to consider these mitigating factors in the context of the most serious charge undermines the agency's argument as to the reasonableness of the removal penalty. <span class="Italic">See Wynne v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 127, 135 (1997) (finding that, where the record evidence fails to show that the agency deciding official considered any specific, relevant mitigating factors before selecting the penalty, his penalty selection is not entitled to deference, and the Board must independently weigh the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to evaluate the reasonableness of the penalty).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Evidence of proper consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors may be indirect. That a deciding official considers other penalties in an adverse action does not suggest that the one chosen was unreasonable; it indicates that the official acted prudently and with care. <span class="Italic">Bradbie v. EEOC</span>, 705 F.2d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1983). If the agency acts to reconsider the penalty proposed, that is evidence that agency officials conscientiously considered relevant factors in mitigation of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 23 MSPR 554, 557 (1984); <span class="Italic">see Lindsey v. DOJ</span>, 16 MSPR 310, 312 (1983) ("The fact that removal was proposed by the appellant's supervisor and then mitigated by the agency to permanent demotion does not diminish the seriousness of each individual charge but rather, reflects the agency's willingness to consider the appellant's previously unblemished record.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency does not consider any mitigating factors, the defect is cured by the Board's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> determination of the propriety of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Trent v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 83-1317); <span class="Italic">cf. Peterson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 178, 185 (1992) (although the proposing and deciding officials did not consider mitigating factors, the error was not harmful because the AJ considered the relevant mitigating factors and found that the removal penalty was within the bounds of reasonableness); <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 334, 344 (1987) (although the deciding official had an overly restrictive view of his options, there was no error because "the appellant's removal clearly was within tolerable limits of reasonableness").
