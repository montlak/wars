<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-247"><span class="space">M.</span> REVIEW OF ARBITRATION AWARDS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Arbitration decisions (known as "awards") are the product of grievance and arbitration provisions of collective bargaining contracts. The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) reviews most challenged arbitration awards in the federal sector. Postal Service arbitration awards are outside the jurisdiction of FLRA. Also outside the review authority of FLRA (through exceptions) are arbitration awards in matters otherwise appealable to the Board, generally adverse actions and performance-based actions. As to awards involving matters otherwise appealable to the Board, MSPB is empowered to review awards involving non-Postal Service employees who allege discrimination as an affirmative defense. Under the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 389 (1986), discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>, the Board conducts a record review, not a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing, on cases coming to it from arbitrators' awards. "In Board terminology, a petitioner submits to the full Board a "request for review" of an arbitrator's decision, whereas she submits a "petition for review" of an administrative judge's initial decision." <span class="Italic">Cirella v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 63 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP). If an issue of discrimination arises in an arbitration review and there was no factfinding or insufficient factfinding by the arbitrator, the Board may assign the case to one of its AJs to develop a factual record on the EEO claim. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-252.html#sec5-251">Remand for Resolution of EEO Issue</a>"; refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-263.html#sec1-258">Appeal Right With Arbitration Award; Employees of Agencies Other Than Postal Service</a>"; refer to Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Labor Relations Authority Law and Practice</span> (Dewey Publications, Inc. 2023) and Broida's, <span class="Italic">Principles of Federal Sector Arbitration Law</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/21POA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Postal Service employees who have available to them both a contract grievance procedure and the Board appellate processes may invoke both under specified conditions. The Board does not review the Postal employee's arbitration award, but the Board will generally defer to that award in the course of evaluating the employee's Board appeal. Discussed below are, first, cases involving employees outside of the Postal Service, and then cases involving Postal employees. The Board's review of arbitration awards should not be confused with an expedited hearing process the Board once used called Voluntary Appeals Arbitration Program (VAAP or VEAP), long abandoned. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Reyman v. EPA</span>, 20 MSPR 403, 404 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For employees in agencies other than the Postal Service, the authority of the Board to review arbitration awards is described, not entirely clearly, by 5 USC 7121:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first. Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1)&#x2003;Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. Similar matters which arise under other personnel systems applicable to employees covered by this chapter may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures, if any, applicable to those matters, or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise a matter either under the applicable appellate procedures or under the negotiated grievance procedure at such time as the employee timely files a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, whichever event occurs first....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7702:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1)Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who--</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board has jurisdiction over a request for review of an arbitration decision when the following conditions are met: (1) the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction; (2) the appellant either (i) raised a claim of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) with the arbitrator in connection with the underlying action, or (ii) raises a claim of discrimination in connection with the underlying action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) for the first time with the Board if such allegations could not be raised in the negotiated grievance procedure; and (3) a final decision has been issued. <span class="Italic">Scanlin v.

Further, a request for review of an arbitrator's decision is timely if filed 35 days from the issuance of the arbitration decision or, if the appellant shows that she received the decision more than 5 days after it was issued, within 30 days after the date she received the decision. <span class="Italic">Kirkland v.

<p class="Body-Text">Clear? From all this, it is seen that the Board's review of arbitrators' awards involves cases ordinarily within the Board's jurisdiction, involving agencies and personnel to whom 5 USC 2302(b)(1) applies, leading to a final arbitration decision (award), and a review request to the Board based on an allegation of discrimination covered by 5 USC 7702. Review authority does not extend to a grievance decision that is not a final decision (award) under the grievance procedure, <span class="Italic">Knuckles v. Dept. of Army,</span> CB-7121-14-0025-V-1 (NP 5/27/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Specifically, under the applicable Labor-Management Agreement, the May 20, 2014 step three grievance decision was not a final decision appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). Article 34 of the Labor-Management Agreement provides that if the appellant or the union was not satisfied with the agency's decision on the appellant's step three grievance, the union could refer the matter to arbitration within 20 workdays of its receipt of the decision. It is undisputed, however, that the union declined to elect arbitration pursuant to the negotiated grievance procedure. Under these circumstances, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's request for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under similar circumstances, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Farmer v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 17 F.3d 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), affirmed a Board final decision that dismissed the appellant's appeal of his removal by reduction in force for lack of jurisdiction. The court determined that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because the appellant made a binding election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) to grieve the adverse action through a negotiated grievance procedure and that he, therefore, "retain[ed] no statutory right to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the action" by the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *2. The court also found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal as a request for review of a final grievance decision because, due to the union's withdrawal of its request for arbitration in the matter, the appellant lacked an arbitrator's final decision on which to base a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In so finding, the court rejected the appellant's argument that his step three grievance decision should constitute a final grievance decision for purposes of Board review. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court found that, because the collective bargaining agreement provided for arbitration as a last resort, his step three grievance decision was not a final decision on his grievance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Specifically, the court found:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, if Farmer were dissatisfied with Navy's decision at step three of the grievance proceeding, his only remaining option was to have the Union initiate arbitration proceedings, a decision at the end of which would constitute a final decision within the meaning of section 1201.154(d).[5] Any other decision in the grievance proceeding, if not satisfactory to Farmer, merely provided Farmer with an opportunity to pursue a "final decision" on which he could appeal to the Board. That Farmer ultimately surrendered his opportunity through the Union's actions, however, does not render the decision at step three "final" such that he can then appeal to the Board without first following through on a request for arbitration, because the agreement specifically provides for the next procedural step to be followed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Farmer</span> is also consistent with the Board's approach in removal appeals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e), in which the Board has long held that, where an appellant undisputedly elected to first challenge his removal through the negotiated grievance procedure, the Board will not assert jurisdiction over the matter even in cases where the union decided not to arbitrate the appellant's grievance of his removal. <span class="Italic">See Martinez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that, if the Board modifies or sets aside the arbitration decision, the Board should reinstate the agency-selected penalty of removal. It contends that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in analyzing whether the agency proved a "charge of menacing," which is not one of the two charges upon which the appellant was removed, and in failing to defer to the agency-selected penalty where, as here, all of the actual charges were sustained.

The bottom line is that the Board has jurisdiction to review a final arbitration award involving a personnel action otherwise within the Board's appellate jurisdiction if one of the challenges to the award involves a prohibited personnel defense based on discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (as amended), under the ADEA, under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act prohibiting certain types of sex discrimination, and under the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The subject of Board review of an arbitrator's decision is one of first impression and the Board must consider whether, and if so under what circumstances, it has jurisdiction to review such cases. Consideration of this question begins with examination of the pertinent statute, turning to review of the legislative history, and finally to the particulars of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title VII of the Reform Act governs labor management relations in the federal government. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) requires any collective bargaining agreement to provide procedures for the settlement of grievances. The negotiated procedures are to be the exclusive procedures for resolving negotiable grievances with two exceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first exception is contained in subsection (d) of that section. It allows an employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) to raise the matter under the applicable statutory or negotiated procedure, but not both. The subsection further provides, however, that selection of the negotiated procedure does not prejudice the right of an employee to request the Board "to review that final decision pursuant to section 7702...in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other exception is provided in subsection (e), which allows employees the right to pursue matters covered under sections 4303 (certain performance based actions) and 7512 (disciplinary actions), through either a negotiated procedure or the appellate procedures of section 7701. Unlike the exception provided in subsection (d), however, an arbitrator's decision under this subsection is not appealable to the Board, but is judicially reviewable as if it had been rendered by the Board. Section 7121(f). Except for cases under this subsection, either party to arbitration may file exceptions to an arbitrator's award with the FLRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of the statute provides for Board review of an arbitrator's decision only when there is an allegation of prohibited discrimination raised in connection with a matter otherwise appealable to the Board as set forth in section 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title VII of the Reform Act was introduced in the House as an amendment to H.R. 11280, 95th Cong., 2d. Sess. (1978). Section 7121 of the proposed amendment provided for negotiated grievance procedures and gave employees the right to pursue a grievance through a negotiated procedure or, when applicable, through existing statutory procedures. An appellant could not use both procedures, except when the matter involved prohibited discrimination as set forth in section 2302(b)(1).[2] In such cases the employee could request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to review the arbitrator's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;2302(b)(1) of the proposed Reform Act, made it a prohibited personnel practice to take or influence any personnel action which unlawfully discriminates "for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of political affiliation, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or handicapping condition."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As passed, the section extends to discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;On the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as prohibited under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;on the basis of age, as prohibited under sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 USC 631, 633A);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;on the basis of sex, as prohibited under section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 USC 206(d));</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;on the basis of handicapping condition, as prohibited under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 791); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003;on the basis of marital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under any law, rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">H.R. 11280, as reported on July 31, 1978, by the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, provided for similar negotiated grievance procedures in section 7121. As in the original proposal, the employee could appeal an arbitrator's decision to the EEOC. However, the House version allowed an appeal to the EEOC pursuant to section 3 of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, or when provided for by EEOC regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate version of section 7121, as reported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs, contained several notable differences from the administration and House versions. One such difference was subsection (f), which allowed an employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review an arbitrator's decision involving "discrimination matters listed in 5 USC 2302(b)(1)," pursuant to section 7702. The Senate bill also provided that an arbitrator's decision in matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 would be treated as though it had been rendered by the Board for purposes of judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Conference Committee adopted the presently codified version of section 7121, and it was passed by the Senate and the House as reported. The Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference did not comment on section 7121(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, subsection (d) of the statute gives employees the right to appeal an arbitrator's decision to the Board pursuant to section 7702. Therefore to correctly interpret section 7121(d), it is necessary to read it in conjunction with section 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7702 sets forth the appellate procedures for appeals to the Board of actions involving discrimination. The Board has jurisdiction to decide the discrimination issue if the appellant raises the issue in conjunction with a matter otherwise appealable to the Board. The appellant can then petition the EEOC to consider the Board's decision. The EEOC may concur with the Board or it can render a different decision on the discrimination issue; if the EEOC issues a different opinion, the Board must then adopt the decision or reaffirm its prior decision, with modifications if necessary. If the Board does not adopt the EEOC decision, a panel composed of one Board member, a Commission member, and a Chairman appointed by the President would consider and decide the case. Thus a "mixed case" can receive varied consideration under section 7702, which balances the respective expertise of the Board and the EEOC in an effort to protect the integrity of each.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1824"></span>One of the House conferees indicated that section 7121 did not allow an employee to appeal an arbitrator's decision to the Board. Mr. Ford of Michigan, in a statement entered in the Congressional Record after the Reform Act was passed, said that section 7121(d) gave an employee the right to request the EEOC to review a final decision under a grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He said that section applied to mixed cases, and explained that "if the conferees had agreed to have 'mixed' cases proceed from arbitration through the Board to EEOC and, ultimately, to court" they would have vitiated the benefits of arbitration. He also explained that the compromise reached on section 7702 was designed "to avoid an apparent denigration of the Board in the mixed cases," implying that due to this compromise it was decided that there was no need to involve the Board in section 7121 cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ford's remarks are deserving of attention since he was involved in the passage of Title VII as a House conferee. We can not, however, agree with his interpretation of the statute in light of its text and legislative history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In regard to section 7702, it was said in the Joint Conference Report that, "in all mixed cases, that is cases involving any action that could be appealed to the MSPB and which involve an allegation of discrimination, the MSPB will hold hearings and issue a decision on both [issues]." Conference Report, <span class="Italic">supra</span> at 140. The section clearly requires that any mixed case must be presented to the Board before it is reviewed by the EEOC. Any interpretation of section 7121 must be consistent with this requirement, especially since 7121 refers to 7702 in subsection (d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the foregoing, we conclude that section 7121(d) provides an exception which allows arbitrator decisions to be reviewed by the Board. This exception, however, is confined to cases in which the employee has been affected by a prohibited discriminatory action as set forth in section 2302(b)(1), and which could have been appealed to the Board pursuant to section 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering this case in light of our conclusion, we note that in the request for review it is alleged that "a review of this decision is warranted since it involves a decision which is not in accordance with law...and, the decision was based on a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)...." This assertion, for reasons set forth below, is insufficient to establish the Board's jurisdiction pursuant to section 7121(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispute in this case centered on whether management had violated an article of the union/management agreement. More specifically, the union position is that management improperly excluded the grievants from participation in Project Mainstream, which gives certain employees special opportunity to compete for transfer or promotion. The union contends that management designated the grievants positions as "bridge positions" when they should have been designated as "dead-end positions." Since grievants were not in positions designated as dead-end positions, they were not eligible for participation in Project Mainstream. The threshold issue, then, is whether the grievants initially could have appealed management's action to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a), "[a]n employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." The regulations of OPM in effect in 1979, at Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 300, governed employment practices in the civil service. Section 300.104(a)(1) provided that, a "candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him and which is administered or required by the Commission [now OPM] violates a basic requirement in section 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Commission [now the Board]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The union does not assert that Project Mainstream was required or applied by the Office of Personnel Management or CSC, its predecessor. The union complains of implementation of an upward mobility program which management established. Accordingly, implementation of the program is not appealable to the Board since the employment practice complained of was not administered or required by OPM.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The review scheme is exclusive and requires an <span id="Page_1825"></span>allegation of prohibited discrimination. 5 USC 7121(f) does not independently confer review jurisdiction on the Board, <span class="Italic">Morin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 396, 398 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121(f) provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that section 7121(f) does not confer a right to appeal to the Board from an arbitrator's decision. The plain language of that section states that "judicial review" of an arbitrator's award may be sought in the same manner "as if the matter had been decided by the Board." Thus, section 7121(f), by its terms, provides only for court review of arbitrators' awards in the same manner as court review of the Board's decisions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303 and 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See Ogden Air Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Center and American Federation of Government Employees Local 1592,</span> 6 MSPB 531, 6 MSPR 630, 632 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Board may only review the decision of an arbitrator if an allegation of prohibited discrimination has been raised in the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b); <span class="Italic">Stickles v.

<p class="Body-Text">An arbitration award is reviewable for errors of civil service and EEO law as well as for analysis of penalty mitigation. The review standard is deferential to the arbitrator's analysis. Several principles, discussed below, guide the Board's analysis of an award: (1) an award will be modified or set aside only where the arbitrator has erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation; (2) factual determinations are entitled to deference unless the arbitrator erred in his legal analysis, e.g., by misallocating burdens of proof or employing the wrong analytical framework; (3) the arbitrator's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision; (4) an arbitrator is uniquely qualified to interpret the collective bargaining agreement; (5) a finding that an appellant did not prove his discrimination claim is also a factual determination entitled to deference unless the arbitrator erred in his legal analysis; (6) an arbitrator should provide a reasoned decision, following the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis, if she mitigates a penalty. [Refer below to "Standard of Review."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's deference to an arbitrator's decision was summarized, <span class="Italic">Hidalgo v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 645, 651 &#x00B6; 7 (2003):</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The basic determinants of the Board's review were set out in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 389, 392-98 (1986) (recon. den. 31 MSPR 479 (1986)), a case that also determined that in cases not involving Postal Service employees (whose grievance arbitration and Board review rights are discussed in Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-154.html#sec1-153">Postal Service</a>," and later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-12-257.html#sec5-256">Method and Scope of MSPB Review</a>"), the Board generally conducts an appellate or paper review, not a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing, on cases coming to it from arbitrators' awards or decisions. The Board defers to arbitrators' factual findings, ensures that legal findings conform to civil service law, and resolves both issues of civil service and discrimination law arising directly or by implication from an arbitrator's award and challenged through Board review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board's authority to review arbitration decisions in mixed cases is established, it has not determined the extent of that review. In <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Center and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1592,</span> 6 MSPB 531, 6 MSPR 630 (1981), the Board found that it has authority to review arbitration decisions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) where the employee has been affected by a prohibited personnel practice as set forth in &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and where the action could have been appealed to the Board pursuant to &#x00A7; 7702. The Board, however, also found that the matter in question in <span class="Italic">Ogden</span> did not meet the jurisdictional test of &#x00A7; 7121(d) and denied the request for review. Thus, the Board did not reach the issue of the scope of review of cases meeting the requirements of &#x00A7; 7121(d).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In discussing the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act, the Board interpreted the statement in the Joint Conference Report that in all mixed cases under &#x00A7; 7702 the Board will hold hearings and issue a decision on both issues, to mean that the mixed case under &#x00A7; 7121(d) must be presented to the Board before it is reviewed by EEOC. Thus, the Board did not decide how it would treat the case once presented. <span class="Italic">Ogden, supra,</span> at 534, 6 MSPR at 634.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, appellant has satisfied the jurisdictional requirement of &#x00A7; 7121(d) because she has alleged that the agency action was based upon racial and sex discrimination, and the action could have been appealed to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303(e), 7702(a)(1). We find that the relevant statutory provisions do not provide for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of arbitration decisions appealable under &#x00A7; 7121(d) in light of the statutory language, legislative history and the policy considerations of the Civil Service Reform Act (the Act).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) provides that employees affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may "raise the matter" under the statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. The statute then provides the manner of the election of the forum and further provides that selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the employee's right to request the Board to "review the final decision" rendered in the negotiated procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear, therefore, that the statute distinguishes between an employee's right to originally "raise the matter" under the negotiated or statutory procedure, and the later right to request the Board "to review" the final arbitration decision. This difference in language supports the conclusion that the "review" before the Board does not encompass the type of full <span class="Italic">de novo</span> adjudication an appellant may originally receive by electing to "raise the matter" before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, affording a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review before the Board would render the statutory bar against proceeding in both forums meaningless. Under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d) and 7121(e), an employee may raise the matter in either forum, "but not both." Subsection (e) allows an aggrieved employee to raise a matter covered under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512 under the Board or negotiated procedures, "but not both." Unlike subsection (d), however, subsection (e) does not allow the Board to "review the final decision." The Board has recognized that the prohibition against proceeding in both forums set forth in &#x00A7; 7121(e) divests it of jurisdiction where an employee first elects the negotiated procedure. <span class="Italic">See Carreno v. Department of the</span> Army, 22 MSPR 515 (1984); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3(b). Similarly, treating the request "to review" the final decision under &#x00A7; 7121(d) in the same manner as an election to "raise the matter" would in effect abrogate the prohibition against pursuing the action in both forums.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we do not find that the relationship between &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d), 7702, and 7701 requires <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Board. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) provides that the Board shall decide mixed cases in accordance with its procedures under &#x00A7; 7701. This latter provision provides appellant the right to a hearing before the Board. In interpreting these provisions, however, the specific provisions of &#x00A7; 7121(d), prevail over the more general references to &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702 and 7701. <span class="Italic">See Castaneda-Gonzales v. Immigration and Naturalization Service,</span> 564 F.2d 417, 423 (D.C. Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the statutory scheme should be interpreted in a manner producing reasonable results, consistent with the policy of the legislation as a whole. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 504, 1 MSPR 505, 525 (1980), <span class="Italic">citing United States v. American Trucking Association, Inc.</span>, 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S. Ct. 1059, 1063, 84 L. Ed. 1345 (1940). The Act's primary policy considerations and goals include improving labor-management relations through the collective bargaining process, and simplifying and expediting procedures in actions against employees who perform unacceptably. <span class="Italic">See Cornelius v. Nutt,</span> [472 U.S. 648], 105 S. Ct. 2882, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In transmitting the proposed draft of the Act to Congress, President Carter stated that one goal of the Act was to improve labor-management relations. To achieve this goal, the President stated that the purpose of the Act was to improve the collective bargaining process establishing grievance and arbitration systems which would largely displace the multiple appeals systems then in existence. <span class="Italic">See</span> Message from the President of the United States Transmitting a Draft of Proposed Legislation to Reform the Civil Service Laws, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII</span> <span class="Italic">of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978,</span> at 623, 626 (1979). Congress enacted 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101(a) and 7121(a) and (b), providing that labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest, and that any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for grievance settlements, including questions of arbitrability. They also provide that any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Congress clearly considered arbitration a significant mechanism for promoting improved labor-management relations. The nature and role of arbitration, therefore, comprise important factors in determining the Board's role in reviewing such decisions. Arbitration has been described as a traditionally informal proceeding in a bargained-for system of self-government created by the parties, providing the therapeutic function of resolving disputes in a speedy and inexpensive manner while preserving the ongoing relationships of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Devine v. White,</span> 697 F.2d 421, 432, 435 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Affording the appellant an opportunity for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review would significantly undermine these advantages by allowing one party covered under the collective bargaining agreement to unilaterally determine that the bargained-for system of adjudication is not binding, contrary to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(b)(3)(C). Further, the advantages of speed and inexpensive processing would be lost since the Board would not be bound by the previous arbitration determination. <span class="Italic">De novo</span> review before the Board would, therefore, unnecessarily increase the cost and effort needed to resolve the dispute and substantially delay final resolution of the matter.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Although not necessary to the result here, the Congressional purpose of Chapter 43 also merits consideration, since the policy of the Act as a whole provides a basis for resolving the issue in question. <span id="Page_1826"></span><span class="Italic">See Parker, supra</span>. One of the Act's primary aims was to simplify and expedite procedures to take action against an employee whose performance is unacceptable. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1978) <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> House Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Civil Service</span> <span class="Italic">Reform Act of 1978,</span> at 1466 (Comm. Print No. 96-2, 1979) U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, 2723. Congress, therefore, created Chapter 43, a streamlined statutory scheme for actions based upon acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Federal Home Loan Bank Board,</span> 23 MSPR 633 (1984). Providing an additional level of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review for Chapter 43 cases following the negotiated procedure would complicate this Congressional attempt at simplification and frustrate this primary aim of the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review is not required to protect employees' statutory trial rights on discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Gardner Denver</span>, 415 U.S. 36, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed.2d 147 (1974). Under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(e) and 7703, employees still have a right to a trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span> in federal district court on their discrimination claims if the Board fails to issue a judicially reviewable decision within 120 days or upon issuance of a final Board order or decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the above considerations, we find that appellants are not entitled to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of final arbitration decisions appealable to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We find that this conclusion does not denigrate an employee's right to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of mixed cases before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Ogden, supra,</span> 6 MSPB at 534, 6 MSPR at 634; Committee Report at 40. As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Ogden, supra,</span> the requirement in the legislative history that the Board hold hearings and decide all mixed cases which are appealed only requires that the case be presented to the Board prior to review by EEOC. Further, limited review of arbitration decisions does not abrogate an employee's right to have the Board conduct a full evidentiary determination of a mixed case since the employee is free to choose such a proceeding in lieu of the negotiated procedure. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining its scope of review of arbitration decisions, the Board recognizes arbitration's unique role in labor-management relations. Due to this role, and the federal policy favoring arbitration, courts have traditionally accorded great deference to arbitration decisions in the private sector. <span class="Italic">White, supra,</span> at 435. The courts have also recognized that while this private sector policy is not fully incorporated into the federal system, arbitration decisions in the public sector should be accorded deference and should only be set aside or modified where the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 437-40; <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt,</span> 718 F.2d 1048, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds, sub nom</span> <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt, supra</span> (deference is inappropriate where award conflicts with federal statute).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress also recognized this policy of judicial deference in providing for review of arbitration decisions by the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). In 5 USC &#x00A7; 7122(a), Congress provided for FLRA modification of an award if it is: (1) contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or (2) deficient on other grounds, similar to those applied by federal courts in private sector labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2425.3(a). Thus, according arbitration decisions deference is consistent with judicial and Congressional policy favoring arbitration, promotes the Act's goal of utilizing arbitration as a means of improving labor-management relations, and recognizes the differences between the role of arbitrators and that of the Board's presiding officials. The proper scope of Board review must also ensure that arbitrators correctly decide issues of law which fall within the Board's area of expertise. We, therefore, find that unlike initial decisions subject to Board review under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115, arbitration decisions are entitled to deference and the deferential standard of review is appropriate for the Board. The Board will, therefore, only set aside or modify an arbitration award where the appellant establishes that the arbitrator has erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Nutt, supra,</span> at 1053; <span class="Italic">White, supra,</span> at 440.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the statutory language, legislative history, and practical considerations, the Board will decide both allegations of discrimination and otherwise appealable matters in reviewing arbitration decisions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d). That provision specifically states that Board review of the arbitration decision is pursuant to &#x00A7; 7702. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) provides that the Board shall "decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action." Thus, the statute plainly requires the Board to decide both issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion is also supported by the Act's legislative history. The Senate Report on the Act stated that in mixed cases, questions of the employee's inefficiency or misconduct and discrimination by the employer will be two sides of the same question and must be considered together. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Army,</span> 715 F.2d 1485, 1490 (Fed. Cir. 1983) <span class="Italic">citing</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 53, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2775. The report also recognized that bifurcation at the administrative level would preclude the government from effecting a single unified personnel policy which takes into account the requirements of all the various laws and goals governing Federal personnel management. The report also expressed congressional concern that bifurcation would result in forum shopping and inconsistent decisions. <span class="Italic">See Hayes v. United States Government Printing Office,</span> 684 F.2d 137, 139 (D.C. Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">citing</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 53, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2775.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Comptroller General also expressed his view in a letter to the House of Representatives, that bifurcation at the administrative level was undesirable. The Comptroller General stated that a clear distinction between an equal employment and merit principle complaint would be difficult, if not impossible, and that employees frequently perceive their problems to be both. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, citing H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 107 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, practical considerations also favor the Board deciding both issues on review. For example, if the Board were limited to deciding only the discrimination issue, it might be required to approve an award which is correct on that issue while clearly in error with respect to the applicable civil service law on the nondiscrimination issue. Further, Board resolution of discrimination cases and dual motivation discrimination cases often involves a determination on the nondiscrimination issue to resolve whether the agency had a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the action<span class="Italic">. See Bechtel v. Office of Personnel</span> Management, 10 MSPB 269, 11 MSPR 309 (1982); <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 8 MSPB 599, 603, 605, 9 MSPR 268, 274, 276 (1981). We, therefore, conclude that the Board will decide both discrimination issues and other appealable issues in conducting its limited scope of review of arbitration decisions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt, supra,</span> the Supreme Court stated that Congress clearly intended that arbitrators apply the same substantive rules as the Board in reviewing agency disciplinary actions. The Court, therefore, found that arbitrators must apply the harmful error standard in the same manner as the Board. The Court held that different interpretations of this substantive provision between forums would lead to inconsistent results and forum shopping which Congress specifically sought to avoid. The Court also found that the Board interpretation of that rule was required to remain faithful to the Act's central purpose of preserving the federal manager's ability to maintain an effective and efficient work force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the considerations set forth in <span class="Italic">Cornelius,</span> the Board will review arbitration decisions to ensure conformity with civil service law based upon Board precedent. This will promote the congressional aim of lessening the likelihood of inconsistent results between arbitration and Board adjudication, and will discourage forum shopping. It will also further the Act's aim of preserving the federal manager's ability to maintain an efficient and effective work force since these managers will be more confident that a particular action would be reviewed similarly in either forum.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As to the role of EEOC, for the ordinary case appealed to and within the jurisdiction of the Board, 29 CFR 1614.303(a) (2022) provides for EEOC review of a Board final decision on a mixed case appeal. As to an arbitrator's award in a case that would otherwise be within the Board's jurisdiction, 29 CFR 1614.401 (2022), describes the EEOC review route:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;A grievant may appeal the final decision of the agency, the arbitrator or the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) on the grievance when an issue of employment discrimination was raised in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits such issues to be raised. A grievant may not appeal under this part, however, when the matter initially raised in the negotiated grievance procedure is still ongoing in that process, is in arbitration, is before the FLRA, is appealable to the MSPB or if 5 U.S.C. 7121(d) is inapplicable to the involved agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From the regulation, the route of EEOC review depends on a prior request to MSPB for review of the arbitrator's award of an action otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Time limits for the EEOC appeal are stated at 29 CFR 1614.402 (2022) ("Appeals described in &#x00A7; 1614.401(d) must be filed within 30 days of receipt of the final decision of the agency, the arbitrator or the Federal Labor Relations Authority."). As to the issue of whether review of an award in a case otherwise within the Board 's jurisdiction must be by MSPB prior to EEOC review, the question may be whether the award is a substantive determination on the merits (it should go through the Board) or not (with the possibility of a direct EEOC appeal), and that is a matter of complexity. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Cantrell v.

<p class="Body-Text">The provisions of the Reform Act permitting Board review of arbitrators' awards provides an advantage to employees compared to agencies. Arbitration is chosen because it is a forum that is considered to be more favorable to employees than MSPB. If an employee prevails through arbitration in a challenge to an adverse action or performance-based action, the agency has no appeal to the MSPB or to the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The best that the agency can do is try to persuade OPM to become involved and seek reconsideration from the arbitrator and then, if unsuccessful, to take the case to the Federal Circuit. That is not a likely outcome. If the employee loses at arbitration, the employee can take the case to the Federal Circuit or, by asserting discrimination before the arbitrator and the Board, the employee can take the matter to the Board for review of civil service and EEO issues. If the employee still does not obtain desired relief, the employee can still seek review of the case on civil service issues with the Federal Circuit or, on EEO issues, the employee may seek relief with EEOC or in a federal district court.</p>
