<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-86"><span class="space">2.</span> Provision of, Modification to, Job Equipment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Overton v. IRS</span>, 6 MSPR 439, 449-50, 6 MSPB 373 (1981), examined the problem of an employee who was denied a step increase because a hand injury impaired her ability to operate a film reader. The agency could have but did not make a minor alteration in the machine to allow it to be operated efficiently by the employee. Nor did the agency consider reassignment of the employee, who demonstrated that she was a qualified disabled employee. The agency failed to provide as reasonable accommodation the job engineering needed to use the remaining unimpaired assets of the disabled employee. The denial of the step increase was reversed. An agency unwilling to take an appellant out of a shipboard supervisory mechanic rotation and to undertake the minimal cost of purchasing a few chairs to permit the appellant to work while seated failed to prove that it was an undue hardship to accommodate the appellant's disability. <span class="Italic">Mallard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 27, 32 (1985) (appeal from the agency's failure to reinstate an employee following a compensable injury). But an appellant will not succeed in a disability discrimination defense if he proposed that the agency supply equipment, e.g., an air-supplied respirator, that would not permit the appellant to perform the regular functions of his job even if the equipment were used. <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 154 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Guillory v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 244, 252 (1991) (use of a respirator, as suggested by the appellant, did not qualify as appropriate accommodation because the record medical evidence did not rule out the possibility that chemical irritants affecting the appellant might be absorbed through the skin).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brocks v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 101, 106-10 (1998), concluded that the agency failed to accommodate a disability by permitting a postal worker to use a mail cart to relieve the burden of the constant lifting of a mailbag. The agency failed to support through evidence its claim that use of the cart would so delay or jeopardize mail delivery as to constitute an undue hardship on its operations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who raises a claim of disability discrimination may establish that she is disabled by showing that she is substantially limited in a major life activity, that she has a record of such a limitation, or that she is regarded as having such a limitation. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 552, 558-59 (1997). The term "major life activity" means "functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning or working." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 558-59. Here, the evidence shows that the appellant suffers from a physical disability which causes her to <span id="Page_3484"></span>be unable to perform a portion of her duties without accommodation, and that the agency removed her because of this physical disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, issued after the administrative judge issued the initial decision here, the Board held that the burden-shifting analytical framework under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <span class="Italic">Texas</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 255-57, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1094-96, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981), was inappropriate in situations where there was direct evidence of discrimination, e.g., where the action taken was based explicitly on the alleged disability. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 559-60 (citing <span class="Italic">Monette v. Electronic Data</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Corp.,</span> 90 F.3d 1173, 1184-86 (6th Cir. 1996)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's charge of inability to perform a primary function of her duties is directly related to the appellant's disability. Because the agency explicitly based its action on the appellant's disability, thus presenting direct evidence of discrimination, and did not assert any independent, nondiscriminatory reason for the action, we find that the burden-shifting analytical framework is inappropriate<span class="Italic">. See Clark,</span> 74 MSPR at 559-60; <span class="Italic">see also Monette,</span> 90 F.3d at 1180, 1182; <span class="Italic">Barth v. Gelb,</span> 2 F.3d 1180, 1186-87 (D.C. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 511 U.S. 1030, 114 S. Ct. 1538, 128 L. Ed.2d 190 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only question left for resolution is whether the appellant is a qualified disabled person against whom the agency may not discriminate and whether the agency has shown that the reasonable accommodation at issue would create an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Clark,</span> 74 MSPR at 561; <span class="Italic">Monette,</span> 90 F.3d at 1180, 1182, 1183 &#x0026; n.9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, the appellant must prove that she is a "qualified" disabled person, e.g., a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of her position, with or without reasonable accommodation, without endangering the health and/or safety of herself and/or others. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a); <span class="Italic">Clark,</span> 74 MSPR at 561. However, to meet her burden of proof with respect to establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where, as here, it is undisputed that the appellant could not perform her job without some form of reasonable accommodation, the appellant need merely articulate a reasonable accommodation under which she believes she could perform the necessary duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be assigned<span class="Italic">. Clark,</span> 74 MSPR at 561. If the appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the agency must produce evidence to rebut the appellant's claim. If the employer claims that the disabled individual is unqualified to perform the job, even with the proposed accommodation, the disabled individual must prove that she would, in fact, be qualified to perform the essential elements of the job if the employer were to adopt the proposed accommodation, and that the proposed accommodation is objectively reasonable. The burden of proof remains with the appellant in such a case. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 560-61. If the appellant does prove that she can perform her job, however, or a position to which she can be reassigned, with reasonable accommodation, and/or the agency concedes this point, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show that the reasonable accommodation at issue would create an undue hardship. In determining whether a proposed accommodation would create an undue hardship for the agency, the Board will consider: (1) The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of the agency operation, including the nature and composition of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and cost of the accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(c); <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Put simply, if the employer claims that a proposed accommodation will impose an undue hardship, the employer must prove that fact. If the employer claims instead that the disabled individual would be unqualified to perform the essential functions of the job even with the proposed accommodation, the disabled individual must prove that he or she would in fact be qualified for the job if the employer were to adopt the proposed accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Clark,</span> 74 MSPR at 561, <span class="Italic">citing Monette,</span> 90 F.3d at 1184.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as noted above, it is undisputed that the appellant suffered from a physical impairment, i.e., chronic low back pain. It is further undisputed that, as a consequence of her impairment, the appellant is substantially limited in the major life activity of lifting. Further, the agency regarded her as having such an impairment. There is also no question that the appellant's disability caused her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching its determination with respect to the appellant's ability to perform the essential functions of her position with accommodation, the agency is obligated to fully assess the appellant's medical condition, her job skills, the work environment, and the agency's resources. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 561-62. The burden of persuasion is on the employer to present credible evidence that a reasonable accommodation would impose an undue hardship in a particular situation; determining whether the employer has demonstrated that the proffered accommodation imposes an undue hardship on its operations requires an individualized inquiry to ensure that the employer's justifications reflect a well-informed judgment grounded in a careful and open-minded weighing of the risks and alternatives<span class="Italic">. Hall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 857 F.2d 1073, 1080 (6th Cir. 1988). Further, before excluding an individual from the workplace on the basis of her disabling condition, the employer must independently assess both the probability and severity of potential injury to the individual which might be expected to result from her employment in a particular position; absent such an independent assessment, a good faith or rational belief on the part of the employer that the disabled individual cannot safely perform in a particular position will not be a sufficient defense to an allegation of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Mantolete v. Bolger</span>, 767 F.2d 1416, 1422-24 (9th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 561-62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, an appellant is not required to prove conclusively that specific job modifications are reasonable, but must only make a facial showing that her disability can be reasonably accommodated. <span class="Italic">Clark,</span> 74 MSPR at 562. Here, the record supports a finding that the appellant has articulated a reasonable accommodation under which she can perform her current job or a position to which she could be reassigned. She suggested, and her physicians recommended, that she could perform her duties with the use of a mail cart. Further, there is evidence that mail carts are available and that carts have been used by other carriers to deliver mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thelma C. Whitehurst, Manager, Customer Services, at the Ocean View Station testified that she denied the appellant's requested accommodation because if the appellant had been allowed to use a mail cart (1) she could not have delivered her route in a timely manner and (2) the safety and security of the mail would have been compromised. Whitehurst also stated that one or more other employees have been allowed to use a mail cart on a temporary basis and that those individuals were unable to deliver their routes within established time standards thus requiring overtime and other assistance. Whitehurst estimated that five to ten hours of overtime would cost the agency an average of $150 per week. She testified further that she is very familiar with the appellant's routes and that they are not appropriate for the use of a mail cart, because it cannot be rolled over a lawn or into an apartment building, as the appellant's routes required. She also stated that the Ocean View Station is in a high crime area and that if a carrier left the mail cart to make deliveries, the mail would be unguarded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">James Rollins, Manager, Customer Service Operation, Norfolk Post Office, testified that he was aware of a carrier who was allowed to use a mail cart to make deliveries inside a mall, but he was unaware of any carrier who was allowed to use a mail cart to make street deliveries. J.L. Cheeks, Postmaster, Norfolk Post Office, testified that both Whitehurst and Rollins persuaded him that time and safety factors precluded the assignment of a mail cart to the appellant's routes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the letter of proposed removal contains only a general response to the appellant's suggested modification, e.g., that the routes were not conducive to the use of a cart, and did not cite to any statistical or cost-related evidence that would support the conclusion that the suggested accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Further, there is no evidence that the agency conducted any independent studies, individualized assessments, or even a trial run with the appellant using the cart on her route before initiating the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Virgil Cross, City Carrier, testified that he was allowed to use a cart to deliver mail on route 321, which was one of the appellant's routes. He stated that, although his request was for permanent use of the cart, his actual use of the cart was only temporary. He also stated that, during the approximately two to three months that he used a cart, there was very little difference in the time it took him to complete his duties, he performed his duties within the allotted time, and there were no complaints regarding his work during this period. We note that Whitehurst testified that Cross was unable to deliver the mail within the allotted time while using the cart and overtime was required to complete his duties. However, the agency failed to provide any evidence to support her claim, e.g., overtime lists, time cards, or pay statements. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 560-61. Thus, there is no corroborating evidence to substantiate Whitehurst's statements that additional costs and delays resulted when Cross used a mail cart. Because the burden of persuasion is on the agency to prove any claims that such an undue hardship would occur, Whitehurst's unsubstantiated testimony that the appellant's use of a mail cart would cause an undue hardship to the agency lacks probative value. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 560-61; <span class="Italic">Caseres v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 642, 645-46 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, Lionel Bullock, Union President, testified that there was no policy against the use of carts and that other carriers, including himself, had used carts on the routes and that he was unaware of any complaints. Bullock also testified that the agency refused to allow the appellant the opportunity to demonstrate that she could perform her duties with the use of a cart within the time allotted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, on the basis of the evidence of record, we find that the agency failed to meet its burden of persuasion with respect to its claim that <span id="Page_3485"></span>the requested accommodations would be unduly burdensome. Alternatively, to the extent that the agency argued that the appellant could not safely perform the essential functions of her job with the requested accommodation, or that the requested accommodation was not reasonable, the appellant has rebutted the agency's evidence and argument by showing that mail carts are available, that mail carts have been used by other carriers to deliver mail on walking routes, and that the use of a mail cart is a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 565. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has established a claim of disability discrimination, and is entitled to reinstatement to the Carrier Technician, PS-6, position with reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schrodt v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 609, 614, 616-20 (1998), determined that the Postal Service failed to accommodate and discriminated against an employee when it discharged him for physical inability to perform his position of distribution clerk and when the agency could readily have modified the employee's equipment, a light duty chair, in a manner that would have permitted him to do the work without substantial risk to himself or others:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In removing an employee for physical inability to perform the duties of his position, an agency may not rely solely upon a showing that he has a physical disability<span class="Italic">. See Sargent v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 387, 391 (1992). Rather, it must establish a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability of hazard that his condition may result in injury to himself or others<span class="Italic">. See Spencer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 15, 21 (1997); <span class="Italic">Yates v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 172, 176 (1996); <span class="Italic">Sargent</span>, 55 MSPR at 391. Here, as discussed in the section relating to disability discrimination, the agency has not met this burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...John Dooley, Senior Plant Manager, corroborated Erichsen's testimony, stating that it was not reasonable to continue accommodating the appellant because he was not as productive as other employees in the area. However, while the agency witnesses testified regarding the appellant's alleged difficulties and awkwardness in performing certain functions, they never documented insufficient performance or deficiencies by the appellant in performing his job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's evidence is unpersuasive. Erichsen acknowledged that the appellant never requested to be relieved of carrying his own mail, casing the top two rows of his distribution case, or doing tie-outs. In fact, she stated that she and the appellant never discussed this arrangement, but that it was "something that just evolved." Further, she admitted that although it was not in the appellant's physical restrictions not to stretch, "it just worked out best for us." Moreover, although she stated that the light-duty chair, which was provided by the agency's own office of industrial compensation, allegedly slowed the appellant's production, she did not indicate why the agency could not have modified this device to make its use less cumbersome. In addition, although Erichsen characterized tie-outs as an essential part of a distribution clerk's duties, she then indicated that they took only 30-45 minutes out of an eight-hour workday, and that the appellant did, on occasion, do tie-outs. Dooley's testimony was similarly unpersuasive with regard to actual deficiencies in the appellant's productivity. He stated that the agency maintains records of productivity by operation. The agency, however, never provided such evidence with regard to the appellant's operation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the appellant's allegation that the agency's action in removing him constituted disability discrimination. At the outset, we are aware that under the Rehabilitation Act, federal employers are charged with a greater duty to ensure the employment of disabled workers than are federal grantees or private employers. 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 701, 791, 794. <span class="Italic">See Woodman v. Runyon</span>, 132 F.3d 1330, 1337 (10th Cir. 1997)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying the above principles to the instant case, we disagree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant did not meet his burden of establishing disability discrimination because he failed to "articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he could perform the essential duties of his position." In a disability discrimination case where the appellant seeks some form of accommodation, he must demonstrate that he is a qualified handicapped person, and that the action appealed was based on his disability, and he must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant funded position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 MSPR 490, 493 (1995); <span class="Italic">Savage v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988). To meet his burden where, as here, it is undisputed that some form of accommodation is necessary, the appellant need merely articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes he could perform the necessary duties of his position, or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 552, 558-62 (1997). The appellant here was not required to prove conclusively that specific job modifications would be reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 562. Rather, he needed only to make a facial showing that his disability could be reasonably accommodated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In order to show that it could not accommodate the qualified handicapped employee, the agency was obligated to fully assess the appellant's medical condition, his job skills, the work environment, and the agency's resources. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 562, citing <span class="Italic">McKinney v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01940021 (Mar. 16, 1995); <span class="Italic">Hall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 857 F.2d 1073, 1080 (6th Cir. 1988) (the burden is on the employer to present credible evidence that a reasonable accommodation is not possible in a particular situation; determining whether the employer has demonstrated that the proffered accommodation imposes an undue hardship on its operations requires an individualized inquiry to ensure that the employer's justifications reflect a well-informed judgment grounded in a careful and open-minded weighing of the risks and alternatives). <span class="Italic">See Robinson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> (to be reported at) 77 MSPR 486 (1998); <span class="Italic">Woodman</span>, 132 F.3d. at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant met his burden of establishing disability discrimination. It is undisputed that he suffers from physical impairments, i.e., patellar chondromalacia and patellofemoral pain syndrome in both knees. It is further undisputed that, as a consequence of these impairments, the appellant is substantially limited in the major life activities of prolonged standing, kneeling, and climbing<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1)-(3). Moreover, the agency regarded him as having such impairments<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. There is also no question but that the appellant's disability caused his removal. In addition, he articulated a reasonable accommodation under which he believed he could perform the essential duties of his position, i.e., that the agency allow him to continue performing the duties of a manual distribution clerk as modified by allowing him to use a chair so that he would be in a sitting position during his shift. Further, on cross examination, Dooley admitted that, under certain circumstances, it would be possible to accommodate a distribution clerk who was confined to a wheelchair, but failed to explain why it would be possible to accommodate such an employee, but not the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contended that the appellant was unable to perform the essential duties of his position, even with the proposed accommodation. For the reasons stated above as well as those set forth...regarding our finding that the agency did not prove its charge that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of a distribution clerk, we find that the agency also failed to prove its inability to accommodate the appellant or any undue hardship in attempting such accommodation. Thus, the medical report upon which the agency's decision allegedly was based did not refer to the appellant's specific duties and the inability to accommodate the appellant's condition in carrying out such duties, but rather to a general position description which "could" have involved duties not germane to the appellant's position. The report did not consider the possibility of any accommodations. Further, the agency does not indicate that it provided the appellant with an opportunity to suggest another accommodation. With respect to the appellant's performance in his position as accommodated, we note that the appellant did not request to be relieved of any duties and the agency did not explain why the accommodation proposed by the appellant was not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next contended that the appellant's medical condition posed a safety risk. In this regard, Cindy Erichsen, Supervisor of Distribution Operations, and the appellant's first-line supervisor, testified that the work space could become congested. Further, she stated that the floor tended to become messy because the previous tour would leave bits of plastic string and rubber bands on the floor after sorting third-class mail, and that, although she would "police the area for good housekeeping," there was a possibility of having a string or rubber band on the floor that might cause the appellant to trip and fall. Moreover, she expressed concern that the appellant might have difficulty evacuating the building in case of emergency, because it would be difficult for him to descend four flights of stairs from his duty station to the exit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These contentions lack merit. To exclude an employee from employment based on the risk of a possible future injury, there must be a showing of a reasonable possibility of substantial harm, which is determined in light of the individual's work history and medical history. <span class="Italic">See Yates,</span> 70 MSPR at 176-77; <span class="Italic">Mantolete v. Bolger,</span> 767 F.2d 1416, 1422-24 (9th Cir. 1985) (before excluding an individual from the workplace on the basis of his disabling condition, the employer must independently assess both the probability and severity of potential injury to the individual which might be expected to result from his employment in a particular position; absent such an independent assessment, a good faith or rational belief on the part of the employer that the disabled individual cannot safely perform in a particular position will not be a sufficient defense to an allegation of discrimination). Such a determination cannot be based merely on an employer's subjective evaluation, or, except in cases of a most apparent nature, merely on medical reports. Here, there is no evidence, apart from Erichsen's subjective assessment, that the alleged congestion in the work area, or the supposed strings and rubber bands on the floor, constituted a serious threat to the appellant's safety, or demonstrated a reasonable possibility of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">See Mantolete,</span> 767 F.2d at 1422. Further, the possibility that the appellant might find it difficult to climb down the <span id="Page_3486"></span>stairs to evacuate the building appears to be speculative, inasmuch as his physical restrictions, which preclude climbing, do not include descending stairs. Therefore, we find that the agency has failed to establish a high probability of hazard that the appellant's condition could result in injury to himself or others. <span class="Italic">See Spencer,</span> 73 MSPR at 21; <span class="Italic">Yates,</span> 70 MSPR at 176.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To reach the point of an analysis of whether the agency is required to supply equipment, there must be a clearly stated disability discrimination claim, coupled with an assertion that the agency failed in its accommodative responsibilities. The necessity for careful pleading to the Board is exemplified by <span class="Italic">Spigner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 70, 72 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that appellant, due to a permanent foot injury, was unable to wear the safety footgear required of his Pipefitter position. For this reason, he was assigned light duties for approximately four years before ultimately being removed. Although he asserted that custom-made shoes might have enabled him to meet the requirements of his position, neither appellant nor the agency attempted to acquire and try such shoes. While the record does not evidence any certainty as to the efficacy of custom-made shoes, the essential issue of this appeal was--which of the parties, if either, had the burden of acquiring such shoes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant claimed that because his disability results from an on-the-job injury, "the government" should pay for the resultant necessary supplies under 5 USC 8103. The Board notes that compensation under 5 USC Chapter 81, Subchapter I, is allowed only upon an employee's timely claim therefor to the Secretary of Labor, 5 USC 8121, and that it is for the Secretary of Labor to administer and decide all questions arising under 5 USC Chapter 81, Subchapter I. 5 USC 8145. The U.S. Department of Labor is not a party to this case. Consequently, appellant's reliance upon 5 USC Chapter 81, Subchapter I, is inappropriate in his appeal before this Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the presiding official found that a Navy policy and a Navy memorandum cited by appellant did not support his position that the Navy had been obliged to procure custom-made shoes for him. The Board finds that appellant's petition fails to demonstrate error in that conclusion. Finally, since appellant, represented by an attorney, did not raise the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination and since, consequently, no evidence has been presented on that issue, the Board will not <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> determine, at this point, whether appellant is a "qualified handicapped employee" and, if so, whether he is entitled to a custom-made shoe as a "reasonable accommodation" to his disabling foot condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(1)(D); 29 CFR 1613 Subpart G; <span class="Italic">McKowen v. DLA</span>, 9 MSPB 365, 366, 10 MSPR 98, 100 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon examining the record of this case, the Board concludes that the efficiency of the service is promoted by the removal of an employee who has long remained physically unable to meet the requirements of his position.</p>
