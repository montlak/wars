<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-134"><span class="space">h.</span> MSPB Settlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The reasoning of <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> and <span class="Italic">Vandesande</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was applied by the Federal Circuit to affirm Tucker Act jurisdiction over a suit for damages for lost private sector employment as a result of an improper disclosure by a federal agency that violated a confidentiality clause contained in a settlement agreement accepted by the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. United States</span>, 748 F.3d 1172, 1174-81 (Fed. Cir. 2014), sent the suit back to the Court of Federal Claims for a merits determination, refusing to apply <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to the MSPB determination that Mr. Cunningham's remedy was limited to rescission of the settlement and reinstatement of his MSPB appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cunningham worked as a criminal investigator in the Inspector's Office of OPM from February 23, 2004 until his termination on January 22, 2005. He appealed his termination to the MSPB, alleging that OPM discriminated against him based on his marital status. During the second day of an administrative hearing at the MSPB, Mr. Cunningham and OPM agreed to a settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Mr. Cunningham agreed to withdraw his appeal with prejudice, while OPM agreed to pay him $50,000. The agreement designated the Director of OPM's human resources office as the contact point for reference inquiries about Mr. Cunningham's service as a criminal investigator. In response to such inquiries, the Director was permitted to disclose only Mr. Cunningham's "date of employment and years of Federal service." The agreement also required OPM to remove Mr. Cunningham's termination letter from his personnel file. Furthermore, the agreement included a confidentiality provision that prohibited both parties from disclosing the terms of the agreement and prohibited Mr. Cunningham from disclosing information about his grievance. On October 28, 2005, the MSPB entered the settlement agreement on the record for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In July 2006, Mr. Cunningham was offered a position as a background investigator with the United States Investigation Service ("USIS"), a private company that contracts with federal agencies to perform background investigations. After completing a background investigation, USIS told Mr. Cunningham to report to the next training class in the fall of 2007. USIS also informed Mr. Cunningham that it anticipated receiving a new contract from OPM, and that OPM would conduct its own background investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cunningham reported for training on October 22, 2007. Less than one week after Mr. Cunningham had commenced initial training, the general manager of USIS informed Mr. Cunningham that he was being suspended without pay at the direction of OPM's security office. Mr. Cunningham remained suspended until February 1, 2008, when he was terminated by USIS. Following his termination, he contacted OPM and requested a copy of his personnel file. The file contained a document showing that two OPM employees--neither of whom was the Director of Human Resources--had discussed Mr. Cunningham's termination and subsequent appeal to the MSPB with OPM's background investigator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 24, 2008, Mr. Cunningham filed a petition with the MSPB to enforce the settlement agreement with OPM. On July 16, 2008, an administrative judge found that OPM had materially breached the agreement. The administrative judge explained, however, that enforcement would not be an effective remedy because the MSPB lacked authority to award damages for OPM's breach. Instead, Mr. Cunningham was only entitled to rescind the agreement and reinstate his initial appeal. The administrative judge noted that, if Mr. Cunningham elected to rescind the settlement agreement and reinstate his appeal, he would be required to reimburse the government for the $50,000 payment made to him under the terms of the settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 23, 2009, the MSPB issued a final order adopting the findings of the administrative judge. The MSPB sent the case back to the administrative judge to provide Mr. Cunningham with the option of rescinding the agreement and reinstating his appeal. On February 9, 2009, Mr. Cunningham informed the administrative judge that he only wanted compensation for his damages caused by OPM's breach of the settlement agreement; he did not want his appeal to be reinstated. The next day, the administrative judge dismissed Mr. Cunningham's petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 19, 2010, Mr. Cunningham filed a breach-of-contract suit in the Claims Court, seeking monetary damages for OPM's breach of the settlement agreement.[1] Although the Claims Court found that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 108 Fed. Cl. at 213-21, it dismissed the suit on the basis of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 221-24. Mr. Cunningham filed a timely appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Mr. Cunningham seeks "[p]ast and future economic damages flowing from the breach of the settlement by the Agency, totaling the amount he would have earned at USIS from the date of his suspension without pay to the date of his retirement, plus interest and benefits."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the government challenges the Claims Court's jurisdiction over the suit, arguing that the settlement agreement is a consent decree over which the MSPB has exclusive jurisdiction. Mr. Cunningham challenges the Claims Court's decision that his suit is barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. We review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the Claims Court's decision that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Cunningham's claim. <span class="Italic">Holmes v. United States</span>, 657 F.3d 1303, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Adair v. United States</span>, 497 F.3d 1244, 1250 (Fed. Cir. 2007). We also review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the Claims Court's dismissal of Mr. Cunningham's claim on the basis of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">Acumed LLC v. Stryker Corp</span>., 525 F.3d 1319, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the United States has sovereign immunity, it can be sued only if it expressly consents to suit. <span class="Italic">United States v. Navajo Nation</span>, 556 U.S. 287, 289 (2009). The United States has waived sovereign immunity for breaches of contract via the Tucker Act, which provides that "[t]he United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded...upon any express or implied contract with the United States." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have long held that disputes over settlement agreements are governed by contract principles. <span class="Italic">See Greco v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). However, we have only recently addressed the circumstances in which Tucker Act jurisdiction may extend to a settlement agreement between a federal agency and one of the agency's employees. In <span class="Italic">Holmes v. United States</span>, 657 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2011) and <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. United States</span>, 673 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2012), we found that the Claims Court possessed jurisdiction under the Tucker Act to entertain claims alleging breaches of settlement agreements for Title VII complaints. Under our decisions in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> and <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, the Claims Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Cunningham's suit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, we resolved a split of authority in the Claims Court over whether Tucker Act jurisdiction extends to a claim alleging breach of an agreement that settled an employee's Title VII action. The majority view at the time was that the Claims Court lacked jurisdiction over such claims because Title VII's statutory scheme provided for exclusive review of Title VII actions in district courts. <span class="Italic">See Griswold v. United States</span>, 61 Fed. Cl. 458, 465 (2004) (collecting cases) ("This court has consistently held that it lacks jurisdiction to hear claims alleging the breach of a Title VII settlement agreement due to the comprehensive statutory scheme established under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act."). We rejected that view and held that a suit against the government alleging breach of a settlement agreement is fundamentally a suit to enforce a contract and therefore within the reach of the Claims Court's jurisdiction under the Tucker Act. <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, 657 F.3d at 1312.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time, we cautioned that the alleged breach of a settlement <span id="Page_5370"></span>agreement does not necessarily give rise to Tucker Act jurisdiction. The plaintiff must "demonstrat[e] that the agreement[&#8197;] could fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of a breach." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1315. A settlement that involved "purely non-monetary relief"--such as a transfer from one office to another--would not suffice for establishing Tucker Act jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> had alleged that the Department of the Navy (the "Navy") breached two agreements settling Title VII employment actions. Under the terms of the settlement agreements, the Navy agreed to expunge a suspension letter from Mr. Holmes's personnel file and to document that he had resigned for personal reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Navy also agreed to provide Mr. Holmes with a "neutral reference" in response to inquiries from future employers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1316. Based on these terms, we found that the settlement agreements contemplated money damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We think that, in the context of the two agreements, the purpose of documenting and expunging Mr. Holmes's record clearly was to prevent Mr. Holmes from being denied future employment based on his record as the Navy maintained it prior to the agreements. In short, the agreements inherently relate to monetary compensation through relationship to Mr. Holmes's future employment. Further, there is no language in the agreements indicating that the parties did not intend for money damages to be available in the event of breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, the government argued that one of the agreements at issue was a consent decree over which the Claims Court could not exercise jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1316. We disagreed with the government's characterization of the agreement and thus declined to address the question of whether the Claims Court could exercise jurisdiction over a claim alleging a violation of a consent decree. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But not long after our decision in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, we addressed the relationship between consent decrees and Tucker Act jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">VanDesande v. United States</span>, 673 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, the plaintiff sought damages in the Claims Court for her federal employer's breach of a settlement agreement. The agreement, which settled a Title VII claim, had been incorporated into a final order by an EEOC administrative law judge. The Claims Court dismissed the plaintiff's suit on the basis that Tucker Act jurisdiction did not extend to a settlement agreement that had "been incorporated in a consent decree entered by another court or administrative entity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1347.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reversed, holding that "a settlement agreement, even one embodied in a decree, 'is a contract within the meaning of the Tucker Act.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1351 (quoting <span class="Italic">Angle v. United States</span>, 709 F.2d 570, 573 (9th Cir. 1983)). We noted that the Supreme Court has recognized that consent decrees have a "dual character," possessing attributes of both contracts and judicial orders. <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, 673 F.3d at 1349 (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. ITT Cont'l Baking Co</span>., 420 U.S. 223, 239 (1975)). "The legal status of a Title VII consent decree," we explained, "will depend upon the nature of the case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1348. When a plaintiff seeks to obtain the benefit of the bargain struck by the plaintiff and the government in an underlying settlement agreement, the plaintiff is enforcing a contract. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1350. "If...a settlement agreement was no longer enforceable as a contract once incorporated into a consent decree, the effect would be to divest the Court of Federal Claims of its Tucker Act jurisdiction by the simple act of a court or agency adopting the agreement. We are unaware of any act of Congress that would allow for such an outcome." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Franklin-Mason v. Mabus</span>, 742 F.3d 1051, 1055 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (transferring a federal employee's claim alleging a breach of a Title VII settlement agreement from a district court to the Claims Court because permitting the district court to reserve exclusive enforcement of the settlement agreement would "reduce the scope" of the Claims Court's jurisdiction and thus "violate the time-honored rule that neither a court nor the parties has the power to alter a federal court's statutory grant of subject matter jurisdiction").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under our decisions in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> and <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, the Claims Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction to hear Mr. Cunningham's breach-of-contract claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances of OPM's alleged breach are substantially similar to the circumstances of the Navy's alleged breach in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>. As in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, the purpose of the key settlement terms is "to prevent [the former employee] from being denied future employment based on his record as the [agency] maintained it prior to the agreement[&#8197;]." <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, 657 F.3d at 1316. The settlement agreement here limited what information OPM could disclose and required OPM to remove Mr. Cunningham's termination letter from his personnel file. Mr. Cunningham, like the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, alleges that his former government employer damaged his future employment prospects by breaching the agreement. Moreover, there is no language in the agreement "indicating that the parties did not intend for money damages to be available in the event of breach." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1316. We thus find that the settlement agreement between Mr. Cunningham and OPM "could fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of a breach." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1315.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government points to two differences between the settlement agreements at issue in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> and the settlement agreement at issue in this case. First, the agreements in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> were not incorporated into consent decrees, whereas the agreement here was adopted in a consent decree by the MSPB. Second, the agreements in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> settled Title VII claims, whereas the agreement here settled a claim arising under the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA"), which defines the authority of the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Neither difference warrants depriving the Claims Court of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We answered the government's first point in <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>. Like the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, Mr. Cunningham is seeking to enforce the underlying settlement agreement in order to obtain the benefit of his bargain with his former government employer; he is not asking the Claims Court to enforce the MSPB order. The fact that the settlement agreement was incorporated into a decree does not strip the agreement of its "character" as a contract. <span class="Italic">See VanDesande</span>, 673 F.3d at 1348-50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the government's characterization of <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span> as depending "upon the specific statutory scheme under which [the] original claim arose," we see no language in <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span> that ties its holding to the specific statutory scheme of Title VII. On the contrary, we suggested that "the nature of the case"--the content of the underlying agreement and the manner in which the plaintiff sought to enforce that agreement--determined whether the Claims Court had Tucker Act jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">VanDesande</span>, 673 F.3d at 1347, 1350-51. That reasoning applies with equal force to an agreement settling a dispute arising under the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find unpersuasive the government's contention that the "comprehensive scheme" of the CSRA bars Mr. Cunningham from seeking monetary damages for breach of contract in the Claims Court. In <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, we rejected that notion as it applied to Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Holmes</span>, 657 F.3d at 1312. As the Claims Court correctly noted here, the remedial schemes of the CSRA and Title VII are similar. <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 108 Fed. Cl. at 215 ("In much the same way as the CSRA established a 'comprehensive and integrated review scheme' for the resolution of federal personnel disputes, Title VII established an 'exclusive, pre-emptive administrative and judicial scheme for the redress of federal employment discrimination.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 454 (1988); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 425 U.S. 820, 829 (1976))).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the adjudication of Mr. Cunningham's claim for monetary relief does not involve the review of a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 454 (holding that the comprehensive scheme of the CSRA precludes Tucker Act jurisdiction over the review of an agency's personnel determination); <span class="Italic">Bobula v. United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 970 F.2d 854, 859 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (holding that the Little Tucker Act does not confer jurisdiction over a settlement agreement that requires the court to "review the underlying personnel action"). Mr. Cunningham's suit does not require the Claims Court to review the facts or law underlying his initial discrimination grievance against OPM. Nor does his suit demand equitable relief that might require OPM to undertake a personnel action. Rather, Mr. Cunningham is seeking money damages to compensate for income he would have earned from his private employer had OPM not breached the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Holmes</span>, 657 F.3d at 1316 (emphasis added) (explaining that a statutory scheme does not "preclude a suit for money damages in the event of breach that is separate from, or in addition to, the relief the regulation provides").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we hold that Mr. Cunningham's suit for money damages under the Tucker Act falls within the Claims Court's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the Claims Court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Cunningham's breach-of-contract claim, we turn to the question of whether the claim is barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. We decide that it is not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim is barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> when "(1) the parties are identical or in privity; (2) the first suit proceeded to a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first." <span class="Italic">Ammex, Inc. v. United States</span>, 334 F.3d 1052, 1055 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Claims Court found that Mr. Cunningham's suit satisfied all of the elements of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>: the parties in the suit are the same parties that appeared before the MSPB, <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 108 Fed. Cl. at 222; the MSPB issued a final judgment on the merits of Mr. Cunningham's petition to enforce the settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">id</span>.; and the two claims are based on the same set of transactional facts--the same contract and the same agency conduct, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 222-24. Although we do not disagree with the Claims Court's application of the three <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> elements to Mr. Cunningham's claim, we find that an exception to the rule is applicable here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When applying the rule of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, we have consistently looked to the Restatement (Second) of Judgments for guidance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gillig v. Nike, Inc</span>., 602 F.3d 1354, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Phillips/May Corp. v. United States</span>, 524 F.3d 1264, 1271 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Ammex</span>, 334 F.3d at <span id="Page_5371"></span>1056; <span class="Italic">Young Eng'rs, Inc. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 721 F.2d 1305, 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The Restatement and other authorities recognize that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> should not bar a claim when a court's remedial authority in the first action prevented the plaintiff from seeking the relief sought in the second action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he general rule of [<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>] does not apply to extinguish the claim, and part or all of the claim subsists as a possible basis for a second action by the plaintiff against the defendant[,] [when] [t]he plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts or restrictions on their authority to entertain multiple theories or demands for multiple remedies or forms of relief in a single action, and the plaintiff desires in the second action to rely on that theory or to seek that remedy or form of relief....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 26(1)(c).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also id</span>. &#x00A7; 26 cmt. c ("The general rule of [<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>] is largely predicated on the assumption that the jurisdiction in which the first judgment was rendered was one which put no formal barriers in the way of a litigant's presenting to a court in one action the entire claim including any theories of recovery or demands for relief that might have been available to him under applicable law. When such formal barriers in fact existed and were operative against a plaintiff in the first action, it is unfair to preclude him from a second action in which he can present those phases of the claim which he was disabled from presenting in the first."); Charles Allen Wright, <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice &#x0026; Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 4412 (2d ed.) ("When special jurisdictional limitations prevent assertion of all matters arising out of a single transaction in one action, a second action is not precluded. For federal courts, the limitations may be embodied in special jurisdictional statutes that prove inadequate to support resolution of all disputes arising out of the same setting, or may result from the inherently limited character of the first proceeding.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"For purposes of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>," the Claims Court stated, "the remedy sought by the plaintiff is irrelevant in determining whether two actions are based upon the same transactional facts." <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 108 Fed. Cl. at 223. While that may be true, it is the remedies <span class="Italic">available</span> to the plaintiff in a forum of limited jurisdiction, not the remedies <span class="Italic">sought</span> by the plaintiff, that determine whether <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> bars a subsequent claim in a different forum. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 26(1)(c); <span class="Italic">cf. United States v. Tohono O'Odham Nation</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1723, 1734 (2011) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) ("The jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the United States often requires...plaintiffs to file two actions in different courts to obtain complete relief in connection with one set of facts."). Here, the remedy available in the Claims Court--damages for OPM's breach of the settlement agreement--was not available in the MSPB due to the agency's limited jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the authority granted to the MSPB under the CSRA, the MSPB could only enforce compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement between Mr. Cunningham and OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) (granting the MSPB the power to compel a federal agency to comply with orders of the Board). The MSPB does not possess authority to award monetary damages for the breach of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Foreman v. Dep't of Army</span>, 241 F.3d 1349, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2001). This jurisdictional barrier prevented Mr. Cunningham from seeking complete relief for OPM's breach of contract. He is therefore not barred from pursuing a second claim, against the same party based on the same set of transactional facts, in a court that has the authority to grant the relief that was unavailable to him in the first action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 26(1)(c); <span class="Italic">see also Gurley v. Hunt</span>, 287 F.3d 728, 731 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> did not bar an unfair-labor-practice claim in federal district court that had previously been litigated to a final judgment before the National Labor Relations Board because the Board was "not authorized to award full compensatory or punitive damages to individuals affected by the unfair labor practice").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government acknowledges the exception described in Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 26(1)(c) but suggests that the exception "should not apply in this instance [because the] exception is primarily triggered when there are limitations on the jurisdiction of a system of courts." We see no reason, however, to treat limitations on the jurisdiction of an agency differently than limitations on the jurisdiction of a court for the purposes of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. Indeed, an agency's decisions have preclusive effect only when that agency is "acting in a judicial capacity." <span class="Italic">United States v. Utah Constr. &#x0026; Min. Co</span>., 384 U.S. 394, 422 (1966). It would be odd to apply the rule of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, but not the rule's exceptions, to the decision of an agency that is acting like a court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Restatement agrees, stating that "a valid and final adjudicative determination by an administrative tribunal has the same effects under the rules of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, <span class="Italic">subject to the same exceptions and qualifications</span>, as a judgment of a court." Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 83(1) (emphasis added). If anything, the Restatement suggests that courts should be more cautious before giving preclusive effect to the final determinations of administrative agencies. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 83 cmt. f ("The array of exceptions to the rules of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> that may be applicable to administrative determinations is at least as broad as with respect to judicial tribunals."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 83 cmt. g ("[T]he exceptions stated in &#x00A7; 26(1)(c) and (d) are particularly important in considering claim preclusion with respect to an administrative agency determination.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">Phillips/May Corp. v. United States</span>, 524 F.3d 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2008), upon which both the Claims Court and the government rely, is consistent with the exception in &#x00A7; 26(1)(c) of the Restatement. In that case, a contractor pursued a breach-of-contract claim in the Claims Court after having litigated nine other claims arising out of the same construction contract at the Board of Contract Appeals ("BCA"). <span class="Italic">Phillips/May</span>, 524 F.3d at 1266-67. We affirmed the decision of the Claims Court that the contractor's claim was barred by claim preclusion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1273.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike Mr. Cunningham at the MSPB, the contractor in <span class="Italic">Phillips/May</span> could have obtained complete relief at the BCA. The Contract Disputes Act "established the agency boards and the Court of Claims as alternative initial venues for the litigation of claims both for equitable adjustment and for breach of contract." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1269. Under the Act, the BCA "may grant any relief that would be available to a litigant asserting a contract claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims." 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(e)(2). The contractor's first stop, the BCA, had remedial jurisdiction to award the same relief as the Claims Court. Mr. Cunningham's first stop, by contrast, did not possess jurisdiction to award the same relief as the Claims Court. The MSPB could not award monetary damages for breach of contract. <span class="Italic">See Foreman</span>, 241 F.3d at 1352.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Cunningham is suing the same party for the same breach of contract, he is entitled to seek a form of relief--money damages--that was unavailable to him before the MSPB due to limits on the agency's remedial jurisdiction. Therefore, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not bar Mr. Cunningham's breach-of-contract claim in the Claims Court.</p>
