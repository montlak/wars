<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-25"><span class="space">d.</span> Failure of OPM to Act on Reconsideration Request; Failure of OPM to Advise of Reconsideration Right</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There is an exception to the rule requiring a reconsideration decision: the Board can take jurisdiction if OPM improperly fails to respond to a reconsideration request, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 160, 161 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An OPM reconsideration decision is usually a prerequisite to Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.110; <span class="Italic">Richards v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 29 MSPR 310, 311 (1985); <span class="Italic">Kalagayan</span> <span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel</span> Management, 9 MSPR 147, 147-48 (1981); <span class="Italic">Obejera v. Office of</span> Personnel Management, 7 MSPB 739, 739-40 (1981). However, if OPM in fact has improperly failed to respond to the appellant's repeated requests for a decision on his retirement application, dismissal of this appeal could effectively prevent the appellant from pursuing this matter. Under those circumstances, the Board therefore would have jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal. <span class="Italic">See Richards,</span> 29 MSPR at 312 (Board assumed jurisdiction of part 831 appeal when OPM failed to advise appellant of his right to reconsideration decision); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Veterans Administration</span>, 21 MSPR 409, 412 (1984) (when an agency improperly denies an employee an opportunity for reconsideration under subpart 531D, the denial is sufficient to allow the Board to assume jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has made no submission in this case, either while the appeal was pending with the regional office or after the appellant filed his petition for review. We therefore are unable to determine, on the basis of the present record, whether OPM has issued a reconsideration decision, or whether it has otherwise responded to the appellant's correspondence. Accordingly, we hereby VACATE the initial decision and REMAND the case to the Seattle Regional Office. The regional office shall obtain a copy of OPM's file in this case (or copies of other relevant documents, if no file has been established by that agency). In addition, it shall determine whether OPM has issued a final determination in this case and, if it has not, whether its failure to do so forms a basis on which the Board should assume jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Johnson v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 193, 196 &#x00B6; 6 (2004), when OPM makes clear that it does not intend to issue a reconsideration decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board has jurisdiction over OPM determinations affecting an appellant's rights or interests under the retirement system only after OPM has issued a final or reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110. However, the Board may take jurisdiction over a retirement appeal in the absence of an OPM reconsideration decision where the appellant has made requests for such a decision and the evidence indicates that OPM does not intend to issue a final decision. <span class="Italic">See Fagone v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 49 &#x00B6; 9 (2000). In light of OPM's failure to respond to the appellant's request for a reconsideration decision, and in light of its assertions below, indicating that it did not intend to issue such a decision, we concur in the administrative judge's finding that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 160, 161 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analysis analogous to <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was provided in <span class="Italic">Triplett v. OPM</span>, 100 MSPR 571, 573-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a final reconsideration decision from OPM is generally a prerequisite to establishing Board jurisdiction to adjudicate an individual's rights and interests under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), when OPM has rescinded its reconsideration decision after the appellant files a Board appeal, and does not issue a replacement, its silence is an implicit negative reconsideration decision and Board proceedings may recommence. <span class="Italic">Nebblett v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's claim of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> in rescinding its reconsideration decision on the appellant's second disability retirement application suggested that it did not intend to issue a new reconsideration decision, and its failure to respond to the appellant's PFR and the Board's show-cause order confirmed that intention.

OPM's actions indicate that the opposite is true here, namely, that it does not intend to issue another reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, the Board will assume jurisdiction over this appeal and will consider OPM's initial decision as the final appealable decision. <span class="Italic">McNeese</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 74 (where OPM has not issued a reconsideration decision and does not intend to do so, its initial decision serves as a final decision over which the Board can exercise jurisdiction)<span class="Italic">.</span> Although OPM may ultimately prevail with respect to its argument that the Board should dismiss this appeal on the grounds of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, the current record includes neither a complete copy of the appellant's second disability retirement application nor OPM's initial decision denying that application.

<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional requirements as to OPM decisions were summarized, <span class="Italic">Duncan v. OPM</span>, SF-0842-15-0458-I-1 (NP 9/1/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or the United States under FERS that is administered by OPM may be appealed to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1). The Board has recognized three situations in which OPM is deemed to have issued an appealable decision under FERS. Two of those situations are prescribed by OPM's regulations: OPM may either (1) issue a reconsideration <span id="Page_895"></span>decision under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.306, or (2) issue an initial decision without reconsideration rights providing an opportunity to appeal to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.307. Either type of decision is final and appealable to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.308. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.306(e), 307. The third situation derives from Board case law. Specifically, the Board will take jurisdiction over an appeal concerning a retirement matter in which OPM has refused or improperly failed to issue a final decision. E.g., <span class="Italic">McNeese v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 70, 74, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). In other words, even an initial decision subject to reconsideration or the absence of any decision at all may, under appropriate circumstances, constitute a final "administrative action or decision" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1). In any event, the Board has jurisdiction over an OPM "final decision" regardless of whether it was issued in the form of a "reconsideration decision." The relevant inquiry is whether OPM has issued a "final decision" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.308--not whether it has issued a "reconsideration decision" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.306.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">If OPM had any doubt as to what relief the appellant was seeking, his submissions in this appeal should have removed such doubt. He explicitly stated in his petition for appeal that he wanted OPM to reinstate his disability retirement annuity as of July 31, 2006. In response to the acknowledgment order, he explained that his September 2006 submission to OPM was intended to be a request for reinstatement of his annuity but OPM had instead treated it as a challenge to the 2003 reconsideration decision. He reiterated, "All I want to do is to have my retirement disability [sic] reinstated...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In its response to the appeal, OPM argued that it should be dismissed as an untimely challenge to the 2003 reconsideration decision. OPM did not address, or even acknowledge, the appellant's claim that it had misunderstood his September 2006 submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the appellant has again made clear that he is seeking to have his disability retirement annuity reinstated, not to challenge the original decision to terminate it. <span class="Italic">See</span> PFR File, Tabs 1 ("I feel I am entitled to again be placed back on retirement disability [sic] since my major depression has returned...") &#x0026; 3 ("I feel I have complied with all of the requirements in order to have reinstatement of my disability annuity effective July 31, 2006."). OPM responded to the PFR, but did not address the appellant's arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At any time during the pendency of this appeal, OPM could have expressed a willingness to consider the appellant's request for reinstatement of his disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See Fagone v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 49, &#x00B6; 11 (2000) (Board declined to take jurisdiction in the absence of a reconsideration decision from OPM where OPM indicated that it would be willing to issue such a decision once the Board appeal was no longer pending). We interpret OPM's silence as an indication that it has no intention of issuing a decision on the appellant's request for reinstatement of his disability retirement annuity. We therefore treat OPM's April 12, 2007 letter, which referred to its March 2003 reconsideration decision on the termination of the annuity, as a final decision that the appellant is not entitled to reinstatement of the annuity. <span class="Italic">See Sims v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 102, &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (finding that an OPM letter referring back to an earlier reconsideration decision "is tantamount to an appealable reconsideration decision...."). Thus, we find that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal, and we remand the matter to the regional office for further proceedings on the merits of the appellant's claim. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board maintained jurisdiction with OPM's notice that it was rescinding its reconsideration decision did not show it would be reconsidering all the issues raised by the appellant in a challenge to an overpayment claim, <span class="Italic">Piedra v. OPM</span>, SF-0845-15-0689-I-1 (NP 1/19/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, if OPM completely rescinds a reconsideration decision, the rescission divests the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal in which the reconsideration decision is at issue, and the appeal must be dismissed. <span class="Italic">Martin v.

However, if OPM does not restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the reconsideration decision has not been rescinded, and the appeal remains within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OPM stated that it was rescinding its reconsideration decision for correction of the appellant's last day of pay. However, OPM did not state that it would address any of the appellant's other concerns, including the calculation of his high-3 salary or his allegations relating to financial hardship. Thus, although OPM purported to rescind the reconsideration decision, outstanding issues remained, and OPM did not indicate that it would address these other issues. We therefore find that, under the circumstances, the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Morin v.

Additionally, the evidence on review seems to indicate that OPM may not have actually rescinded the decision, as it represented below. The OPM letter, although it is undated, appears to suggest that OPM may still intend to collect the overpayment, in accordance with the reconsideration decision. Because the appellant has not been restored to his status prior to the issuance of the reconsideration decision, and because OPM did not grant him the relief he requested on appeal, we find that the appeal remains within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Martin</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 10.<span class="Italic"></span></p>

Essentially, it appears the appellant's bankruptcy petition operates as a stay and precludes OPM from issuing a new reconsideration decision to collect any overpayment from him until the stay is lifted by the court. As there is no indication that the court has lifted the stay, we find the administrative judge properly denied the appellant's petition for enforcement and concluded that OPM demonstrated good cause for its failure to comply with the Board's final order dated May 4, 2010.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Powell v. OPM</span>, 114 MSPR 580, 583-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2010 MSPB 171 (2010), the Board assumed jurisdiction over an appeal from denial of a deferred annuity when, after some correspondence between appellant and OPM, that agency issued what appeared to be a decision, not characterized as final or subject to reconsideration, and not offering a statement of appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the record shows that the appellant filed an application for a deferred annuity with OPM, and that OPM issued a September 18, 2003 initial decision denying the application. The record also shows that the appellant subsequently contacted OPM at least twice because OPM issued letters on December 5, 2003, and December 17, 2007, responding to his further inquiries. It is apparent from the letters themselves that the appellant was making further inquiry into his eligibility for a CSRS annuity. Therefore, we disagree with OPM that "there is no evidence that [the appellant] requested reconsideration." However, the record does not show whether the appellant's inquiries met the criteria for a request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(d) ("A request for reconsideration must be in writing, must include the individual's name, address, date of birth and claim number, if applicable, and must state the basis for the request.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, regardless of whether the appellant properly requested reconsideration from OPM, we find that OPM's December 17, 2007 letter constitutes a final, appealable decision on the appellant's application for a deferred annuity. The letter, addressed to the appellant, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You received a refund of your contributions on 12-22-2006. You are not eligible for any further benefits from the U.S[.] Civil Service Retirement System.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The SF50 you submitted states that you did not pay into the retirement system during this period of service. This time could not be used towards your five years of service needed for a deferred annuity at age 62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The December 17, 2007 letter clearly constitutes a decision on the appellant's eligibility for benefits under the CSRS, but OPM did not label it as either an initial decision or a final decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The letter does not state that the appellant has any right to seek reconsideration from OPM, which is a requirement of an OPM initial decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(c). Nor did it inform the appellant of his right to appeal to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110, which is a requirement of an OPM final decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(f). Under the circumstances of this case, however, we find that the December 17, 2007 letter constitutes a final, appealable decision from OPM. Specifically, the letter did not mention reconsideration, and nothing in OPM's submissions to the Board indicates that it intends to take further action in this case. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 118, &#x00B6; 12 (2010); <span class="Italic">Luna</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 465, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Scallion v.

Because OPM did not inform the appellant of his right to request reconsideration of its December 17, 2007 decision, we find it inappropriate to require a reconsideration decision as a prerequisite for Board review. <span class="Italic">See Richards v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 310, 312 (1985). We therefore find that OPM's December 17, 2007 letter constitutes an appealable final decision affecting the appellant's rights and interests under the CSRS and that the Board has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the appellant's claim.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;To the extent that OPM intended its December 5, 2003 letter to constitute an appealable final decision, that does not preclude the Board from taking jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to the December 17, 2007 letter, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 8, <span class="Italic">cf.

The Board concluded that the letter in <span class="Italic">Muyco</span> did not constitute a decision on the merits of the appellant's claim of entitlement to an annuity, but instead, it merely referred to OPM's previous final decision, which the appellant had already appealed to the Board. 104 M.S.P.R. 557, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 11.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not made repeated requests to OPM for a final decision. Indeed, as discussed above, he made only the single October 28, 1998 request. Moreover, there is no evidence showing that OPM has no intention of issuing a reconsideration decision once this appeal is adjudicated. On the contrary, in its response to the petition for review, OPM expressed a "willingness" to issue such a decision, but stated that the filing of the petition for review caused it not to do so. Hence, we find no basis on which to take jurisdiction over this matter at this time absent a reconsideration decision by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both parties have expressed seeming frustration over the lengthy proceedings. In our view, leaving them to work out, independently, a schedule for exchanging further information could result in more delay. Further, as explained above, OPM apparently has not recognized that the appellant has already filed a reconsideration request, and the appellant has stated an intent to file another request. Thus, in the interest of justice and administrative efficiency, we believe it would benefit both parties if we establish a schedule stating what still needs to be done and by when.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we direct the appellant to file with OPM, within 20 calendar days of the date of this Opinion and Order, any argument and evidence he wishes to submit on the issue of the timeliness of his request for reconsideration.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. This case is not like the previous cases in which the Board has exercised jurisdiction in light of OPM's failure to act. Here, the process has not dragged on for years, nor has OPM given any indication that it does not intend to act on Ms. Dominado's application.

<p class="Body-Text">There may be a question of what constitutes an OPM final decision, <span class="Italic">Perske v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 678, 680 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that OPM's November 4, 1988, ruling on the merits of the appellant's claim for enhanced annuity benefits, which responded to each of his arguments for entitlement within its 11 pages, constitutes a final decision and therefore is reviewable by the Board. OPM acknowledged the decision's reviewability under 5 C.F.R. Part 1201 in its response to the Board's November 23, 1988, Acknowledgment Order. Moreover, OPM's decision did not advise the appellant of his right to seek reconsideration of its merits ruling. <span class="Italic">See id.; Richards v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 310, 312 (1985) (Board found it inappropriate to require reconsideration decision as a prerequisite to Board review where the appellant was unaware that he could request a reconsideration decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richards v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 310, 311-312 (1985), explored when an OPM communication would or would not serve as a basis for a Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to appellant's first contention, we agree that the Board has jurisdiction to consider his appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d) (1) provides that an administrative action or order affecting retirement rights or interests may be appealed to the Board under procedures prescribed by the Board. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), an appeal may be brought to the Board "from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." The Board has jurisdiction over determinations relating to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a) (6). OPM's action dismissing appellant's disability retirement application clearly constitutes an action or determination relating to appellant's disability retirement and, therefore, satisfies the above provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_898"></span>As noted by the presiding official, an OPM reconsideration decision is usually a prerequisite to Board jurisdiction. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3 (a)(8) provides that the Board's appellate jurisdiction includes actions for which jurisdiction has been granted under regulations promulgated by OPM. OPM's regulations state that individuals whose rights or interests under the retirement system are affected by a "final" OPM decision may request Board review. OPM's regulations define a final decision as a decision made on reconsideration of an initial decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831,109(d), (f), 831.110, 831.1205. In addition, an initial decision rendered at the highest level of review available at OPM may also be appealed to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109 (c). Thus, under OPM's regulations, absent an initial decision meeting the requirements of &#x00A7; 831.109 (c), an appellant must obtain a reconsideration decision in order to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that while OPM's letter dismissing appellant's application does not meet the regulatory definition of either an appealable initial decision or a reconsideration decision, the regulatory requirement for obtaining a reconsideration decision should not apply under the circumstances in this case. As discussed earlier, the letter clearly constitutes a decision on appellant's application. It does not, however, state that appellant has any right to appeal or pursue that determination, and it is clear that OPM intended not to issue any further decision on appellant's application. Since appellant was unaware that he could request a reconsideration decision, we find it inappropriate to require that decision as a prerequisite to Board review. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chiarelli v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 3 MSPB 75 (1980) (agency failed to inform appellant of appeal rights; time limit for appeal waived).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that justice compels a finding of jurisdiction in light of OPM's belief that the dismissal is not subject to further review at either agency. Foreclosing review before the Board could effectively prevent an appellant from pursuing a determination on a disability application. Moreover, such a determination could be final if, as in the present case, the time limit for a new application has expired. Thus, denying Board review would totally foreclose any review of the final determination, contrary to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(l). <span class="Italic">Cf. Cody v. Department of Justice,</span> 7 MSPB 127, 134 1981) (lack of reconsideration decision in negative acceptable level of competence appeal does not foreclose review under certain circumstances, based upon the interest of justice). We, therefore, conclude that the Board has jurisdiction to determine whether OPM properly dismissed appellant's application.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Shu v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210210164">845 Fed. Appx. 934</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP) (failure of OPM to respond to retirement-related questions, but with no application or denial or reconsideration decision, did not establish appellate jurisdiction with MSPB); <span class="Italic">Dempsey v. MSPB</span>, 78 F.3d 603 (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3002) (routine correspondence from OPM to an annuitant concerning his annuity did not qualify as an OPM decision under 5 CFR 831.109(c) subject to MSPB and court review).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is remarkably opaque in determining how long OPM can sit on a matter, avoid MSPB review, and how the appellant avoids indefinite delay from the agency that is the guardian of employees' interests in the retirement trust funds. Consider this commentary from <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. OPM,</span> SF-0841-09-0070-C-2 (NP 7/22/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Much of the appellant's petition for review is devoted to his dissatisfaction with his attempts to get a final determination from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as to how much of an overpayment resulted from his election to change the nature of his civil service retirement, and his efforts to seek a waiver of some of that overpayment. As the administrative judge correctly determined in the initial decision, those issues are not properly before the Board in this compliance action, and OPM has not issued a final decision as to either issue, which is ordinarily required for the Board to exercise jurisdiction over a retirement matter. As the administrative judge also noted, the record does not support the Board exercising jurisdiction over these matters, at this time, on the basis that OPM does not intend to issue a final decision. <span class="Italic">See Fagone v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 49, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). Rather, the record reflects that OPM needed, and was waiting for, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service to inform it as to the amount of the appellant's retroactive military retired pay. Should OPM fail to issue a final decision on these matters, the appellant may file a new appeal under the doctrine set out in <span class="Italic">Fagone</span>. We note that, where appropriate, another agency may be joined as a necessary party in a retirement appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 23 (2000); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 571, 573 (1997); <span class="Italic">Isabelle v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 176, 182-83 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A rule of reason applies to an appeal filed without a reconsideration decision. The impatient appellant may find his appeal dismissed as premature, as the court implied in <span class="Italic">Roxas v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the OPM improperly fails to respond to a petitioner's repeated requests for a decision, the petitioner may pursue an appeal before the MSPB prior to a final or reconsideration decision from OPM. Such a situation was described in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 160, 161 (1986). The AJ in this case considered the applicability of this argument and then held that the exception did not apply, since four months was not an inordinate amount of time and further that Roxas had not submitted evidence of repeated requests. We agree.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Staples v. OPM</span>, DE-0842-16-0117-I-1 (NP 8/26/2016) (applied affirming the AJ's determining that the state of the appellant's health did not establish jurisdiction without a reconsideration decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Malone v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3263), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Malone argues that OPM's refusal to act in response to his September letter substituted for a reconsideration decision and, therefore, the Board did have jurisdiction over his appeal. The Board has held that where OPM improperly failed to respond to an appellant's repeated requests for a decision, the absence of a reconsideration decision would not preclude the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 160, 161 (1986). However, Malone did not make repeated requests to OPM. He made only one request and waited only six weeks before filing an appeal. The Board concluded that this delay did not constitute an arbitrary refusal to act sufficient to give the Board jurisdiction over Malone's appeal. We cannot say that the Board's decision was an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit permitted the Board to dismiss an appeal as premature when OPM promised to issue a reconsideration decision as soon as the appeal was dismissed, <span class="Italic">Nava v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3424):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Nava filed one request for reconsideration and waited approximately five months before filing an appeal. OPM has promised a reconsideration decision in its motion to dismiss at the board. The board concluded that, under these circumstances, it could not exercise jurisdiction over Nava's appeal. We cannot say that the board's decision was in error. Accordingly, we affirm, and trust that OPM will issue its decision forthwith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite substantial delays in the reconsideration process, the Board will likely decline to accept an appeal if OPM gives an explanation of the workload problems that led to the torpidity of the reconsideration process, <span class="Italic">McNeese v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 70, 73-75 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the Board's jurisdiction is not plenary, but is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by statute or regulation. Moreover, the Board is without authority to broaden or narrow its appellate jurisdiction through the exercise of inherent power. In general, the Board has jurisdiction over OPM determinations affecting an appellant's rights or interests under the retirement system only after OPM has issued a final decision, that is, a reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, has recognized limited exceptions to this general rule, where OPM has, in effect, refused to issue a reconsideration decision, thus, making its "initial" decision on the retirement application its "final" decision for purposes of a Board appeal. For example, in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 160, 161 (1986), the Board stated that it may assert jurisdiction over a retirement appeal in the absence of a reconsideration decision, where OPM improperly failed to respond to the appellant's repeated requests for a decision on his retirement application. In <span class="Italic">Richards v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 310, 312 (1985), the Board found that the absence of a reconsideration decision did not preclude review of a retirement decision where OPM failed to advise the appellant of his right to request a reconsideration decision, and did not intend to issue any further decision on the appellant's application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the circumstances in the present case do not fall under this exception or warrant another exception to our general jurisdiction rule in retirement appeals. OPM has explained that it has a backlog of cases in its Reconsideration Branch, that these cases are generally being processed on a first-in, first-out basis, and that the delay here in processing the appellant's request for reconsideration is a factor of its workload, and not a denial of the applicant's application for reconsideration. Further, unlike <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, and <span class="Italic">Richards</span>, there is no basis to conclude that OPM's initial decision on the retirement application here constitutes its final decision. Absent a final decision, there is no law or regulation under which the Board can exercise jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we note that OPM has explained that, due to an internal policy, it ceased work on the appellant's case at the time he filed his appeal with the Board, and that the processing of the case would remain in abeyance while the appeal is pending. This action, however, does not provide a basis for concluding that OPM's initial decision is its final decision, since nothing contradicts OPM's statement that it will continue the processing of the application when this appeal process has concluded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that we lack authority to order OPM to process the request for reconsideration within a certain period of time. While the Board has authority to "order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision of the Board," there is no authority for the Board to issue an order to a Federal agency when it lacks jurisdiction over the matter appealed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_899"></span>Board review of an administrative determination of LEO retirement eligibility is generally limited to a final agency decision. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald v.

The Board has recognized a limited exception to this principle when the agency, or OPM, if involved in the determination at issue, refuses to render a final decision. <span class="Italic">See Blade v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 9 (2004); <span class="Italic">McGuire v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 259, 262-63 (1997). In such cases, the Board will assume jurisdiction over the determination at issue, even in the absence of a final decision. <span class="Italic">See Blade</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellants have failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency has refused to render a final decision on their LEO retirement coverage. Although the appellants allege that their retirement coverage eligibility has been pending with the agency for a number of years, the agency demonstrated below that it is in the process of determining the LEO retirement eligibility for a number of agency positions, including the appellants.' The agency has also demonstrated on petition for review that the process of determining the appellants' LEO retirement eligibility remains active and ongoing. We thus agree with the administrative judge that the appellants cannot establish Board jurisdiction over their appeals based on the agency's refusal to issue a final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case, moreover, differentiate it from the few instances where the Board has assumed jurisdiction over an administrative determination concerning retirement eligibility in the absence of a final decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DeGrant v.

In those cases, for example, the Board found that the appellants nonfrivolously alleged jurisdiction based on OPM's refusal to respond to, or acknowledge, the employees' requests for a final decision or orders to show cause issued by an administrative judge in a Board appeal seeking to determine if, and whether, a final decision would be rendered. <span class="Italic">See DeGrant</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 414, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Blade</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 9. Here, by contrast, the agency continues to express an interest and intent to render a final decision. Once final decisions are rendered and if they are unfavorable, the appellants can file appeals with the Board challenging the merits of those determinations. <span class="Italic">See McGuire</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 263; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.807(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit expressed no interest in setting a specific number of months that OPM could hold open the reconsideration process, <span class="Italic">Malone v. MSPB</span>, 590 Fed. Appx. 1002, 1003-04 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB has jurisdiction over appeals from "final decision[s] of the...Office of Personnel Management" "affecting the rights or interests of an individual...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). Decisions of the OPM are final when they are rendered on reconsideration or expressly issued as final decisions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, an exception to the final decision requirement exists where OPM has constructively denied an individual the opportunity to receive a final decision. Typically, constructive denial occurs where OPM neglects to inform the petitioner of the right to seek reconsideration of a retirement application decision, <span class="Italic">see Richards v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 29 M.S.P.R. 310, 312 (1985), improperly denies an opportunity for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">see Phillips v. Veterans Admin</span>., 21 M.S.P.R. 409, 412 (1984), or fails to issue a decision within a reasonable time, <span class="Italic">see Okello v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 120 M.S.P.R. 498, 502-504 (2014). In determining whether there has been constructive denial of a final decision, the MSPB considers OPM's express representations regarding the allegedly forthcoming decision, as well as a litigant's diligence in requesting a decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 503.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts of this case, after OPM issued an initial decision denying Mr. Malone's application, Mr. Malone requested reconsideration on July 15, 2013. Mr. Malone does not dispute--and did not dispute at the MSPB--that OPM has not rendered an opinion on his motion for reconsideration. It is also undisputed that OPM properly informed Mr. Malone of his right to request reconsideration and that OPM did not improperly deny Mr. Malone an opportunity for reconsideration. Therefore, the only issue presented by this appeal is whether OPM constructively denied Mr. Malone a final decision by failing to issue a decision on Mr. Malone's reconsideration motion within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Mr. Malone has not been constructively denied a final decision. This case is most similar to <span class="Italic">Nava v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 94-3424, 1994 WL 623989 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 10 1994). In <span class="Italic">Nava</span>, the petitioner "filed one request for reconsideration and waited approximately five months before filing an appeal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *1. OPM also represented to the MSPB that it intended to issue a final decision on the petitioner's request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This court affirmed the MSPB's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Malone requested reconsideration of OPM's initial decision and appealed to the MSPB after nine months passed without a decision. The MSPB credited OPM's representations that it intended to issue a decision on Mr. Malone's request for reconsideration, and noted that Mr. Malone had not inquired about the status of his reconsideration request before filing an appeal. This court has previously found that a sixteen-month delay did not amount to a constructive denial of a final decision. <span class="Italic">See McNeese v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 61 M.S.P.B. 70, 74 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994). No other circumstances indicate that OPM does not intend to issue a final decision in Mr. Malone's case. <span class="Italic">See Okello</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 498, 502-504 (finding that a six year pendency with no decision despite petitioner's diligence in seeking a final decision was a constructive denial); <span class="Italic">Easter v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 102 M.S.P.R. 568, 571 (2006) (holding that an eighteen-month delay with no acknowledgment of petitioner's application was constructive denial). Mr. Malone may appeal the substantive merits of his case once OPM issues a final decision. For the time being, though, we affirm the MSPB's dismissal of Mr. Malone's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It has occurred that, after much delay by OPM in submitting to the appellant information necessary to meet the condition of an adjustment in retirement earnings, MSPB cuts through the morass and instructs OPM when and how to correct the deficiency, maintaining oversight through the enforcement process (discussed in Chapter 16) while OPM does what needs to be done. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Oliver v. OPM</span>, NY-0831-16-0059-I-1 (NP 4/13/2022) (appellant attempted to make payment for post-1956 military service).</p>
