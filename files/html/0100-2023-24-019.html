<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-19"><span class="space">a.</span> Nonprecedential Decision</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Enough appellants take their chances in the Federal Circuit that a hundred or more decisions are produced annually. Although the Federal Circuit publishes some of its decisions in the reporter system for federal appellate decisions (the "Federal Second" or "Federal Third"), most of its civil service decisions are unpublished, or "nonprecedential," decisions. Traditionally, nonprecedential decisions contain analyses of facts and law, and for many years they were not reprinted in the "official" appellate reporter system. They were traditionally noted as entries in tables of the case reports showing their disposition, and they were available from commercial reporting services. Starting in September 2001, West Group began publishing nonprecedential decisions of all federal circuit courts in the Federal Appendix, bound with the Federal Third reporters. This development expanded the size of the West Federal Reporter and gave new meaning to the concept of unpublished or nonprecedential decisions, for the nonprecedential cases are indexed and digested in the same manner as their favored precedential siblings. The change in access aside, nonprecedential decisions in the Federal Appendix remain nonprecedential--at least until we are otherwise advised by the Federal Circuit, through amendments to its rules, or by the Judicial Conference, through amendments to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We cite and quote selected nonprecedential decisions of the Federal Circuit in this <span class="Italic">Guide</span> because those decisions contain discussion of the law that may be instructive to practitioners. For the same reason, the MSPB also cites circuit nonprecedential decisions. Analysis of law, even without precedential effect, by three appellate judges who have been briefed by counsel, should have some value to anyone considering an approach to a similar case. Some briefs filed with the Federal Circuit might also be consulted for similar reasons, and those briefs may be available, at modest cost, through the federal PACER system or through one of the principle commercial legal databases, e.g., WESTLAW or LEXIS.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonprecedential decisions issued by the Federal Circuit after January 1, 2007--as noted in Federal Circuit Rule 32.1, <span class="Italic">post</span>--may be cited to the court in briefs or argument. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Horner v. Burns</span>, 783 F.2d 196, 201-02 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (court noted approval of the MSPB's practice of treating its initial decisions as nonprecedential and comparing that practice to the court's treatment of its nonprecedential decisions). Do not cite a nonprecedential or unpublished decision in a brief or during argument unless the use of the citation conforms with the practice specified in Federal Circuit Rule 32.1 (replacing Fed. Cir. R. 47.6).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fed. Cir. R. 32.1 (12/2021), "Citing Judicial Dispositions," provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Nonprecedential Disposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A nonprecedential disposition must bear a legend designating it as nonprecedential. A precedential disposition will bear no legend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Nonprecedential Opinion or Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An opinion or order which is designated as nonprecedential is one determined by the panel issuing it as not adding significantly to the body of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Parties' Citation of Nonprecedential Dispositions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Parties are not prohibited or restricted from citing nonprecedential dispositions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Court's Consideration of Nonprecedential or Unpublished Dispositions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court may refer to a nonprecedential or unpublished disposition in an opinion or order and may look to a nonprecedential or unpublished disposition for guidance or persuasive reasoning but will not give one of its own nonprecedential dispositions the effect of binding precedent. The court will not consider nonprecedential or unpublished dispositions of another court as binding precedent of that court unless the rules of that court so provide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Request to Make an Opinion or Order Precedential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Within sixty (60) days after the court issues a nonprecedential opinion or order, any person may request through motion filed in the case that the opinion or order be reissued as precedential. The request will be considered by the panel that rendered the disposition. The motion must identify any case that person knows to be pending that would be determined or affected by reissuance as precedential. Parties to pending
cases having a stake in the outcome of a decision on the motion must be given an opportunity to respond. If the request is granted, the opinion or order may be revised as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Public Records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All dispositions by the court in any form will be in writing and are public records.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some nonprecedential decisions of the Federal Circuit contain significant legal analysis--including dissenting opinions--but the court is strict in its rule that its nonprecedential decisions may only be cited to the court in accordance with its rules.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not noted in the decisions or the Federal Circuit's rules of practice is a phenomenon of some interest to members of the bar who present cases to the court. Many appeals involving represented appellants in civil service (and other) cases result in summary (one-page) affirmation orders. But when a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is before the court, the nonprecedential disposition of that appellant's case is almost always by an articulated (non-summary) decision from the court. Perhaps the thinking is that the unrepresented <span class="Italic">pro se</span> needs an explanation from the court, while the represented appellant will be provided a likely explanation for the outcome by his counsel through remarks from the judges during oral argument--but that is only speculation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court explained its rationale for issuing unpublished or nonprecedential decisions in <span class="Italic">Seligson v. OPM</span>, 878 F.2d 369, 370 (Fed. Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, the stress hitherto has been on nonpublication of judicial opinions, or rather, publication of only a selected few, as a means of conserving judicial resources and keeping channels clear and unobstructed, for legal opinions that really matter to circulate in. A by-product of selective publication is also avoiding needless invasion of the privacy of individuals. The significance of this must not be overstressed as the unpublished opinion is still, of course, a public record that normally anyone can consult and copy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Symbol Technologies, Inc. v. Lemelson Medical</span>, 277 F.3d 1361, 1366-68 (Fed. Cir. 2002), declined to follow an Eighth Circuit ruling finding nonprecedential decisions to be unconstitutional:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Lemelson argues that we are bound by two of our non-precedential opinions under the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Anastasoff</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States,</span> 223 F.3d 898. <span class="Italic">Anastasoff</span> held that Eighth Circuit Rule 28A(i) providing that unpublished decisions are not precedent and, therefore, not binding on future panels of that court violates Article III of the Constitution. It declared that the doctrine of precedent was "well-established" when the Framers drafted the Constitution and any exercise of the "judicial Power" is binding upon future panels because to depart from it would be "an approach to tyranny and arbitrary power, to the exercise of mere discretion, and to the abandonment of all the just checks upon judicial authority" 223 F.3d at 904. "A more alarming doctrine could not be promulgated by any American court, than that it was at liberty to disregard all former rules and decisions, and to decide for itself, without reference to the settled course of antecedent principles." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we subscribe to the comprehensive, scholarly treatment of the issue in refutation of <span class="Italic">Anastasoff</span> set out in <span class="Italic">Hart v. Massanari,</span> 266 F.3d 1155, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001). Article III of the Constitution does not contain an express prohibition on issuing non-precedential opinions, nor can we discern one from the existence of the state of the law when the Framers drafted it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The concept of precedent could not have been incorporated into Article III because case reporters printing accurate versions of issued opinions were not first published until the middle of the nineteenth century<span class="Italic">. Anastasoff's</span> restrictive view of the Framer's notions of precedent is far greater than was even possible at the relevant time period. Published opinions were rare and case reporters were often entrepreneurs who scribbled notes as the opinion was issued by the judge or assembled case reports from secondhand sources<span class="Italic">. See Hart</span>, 266 F.3d at 1166, citing Robert C. Bening, <span class="Italic">Legal Research and Legal Concepts: Where Form Molds Substance,</span> 75 Cal. L.Rev. 15, 18-19 (1987). Reporters were even known to alter or suppress cases they felt were wrongly decided. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1167, <span class="Italic">citing</span> R.W.M. Dias, <span class="Italic">Jurisprudence,</span> 33 (2d ed. 1964). Thus, reliable, accurate renditions of judicial decisions were not available when Article III was drafted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, non-precedential opinions existed even before 1787 and the Framers reasonably could have contemplated the concept. As the volume of reported cases increased, commentators advised not reporting cases that did not contribute to the law for fear of an exponential growth in case law and the requirement to maintain it. Over three centuries ago, Sir Francis Bacon recommended to King James I that cases of "merely iteration and repetition" be omitted from the case reports; and Lord Coke had similarly complained about the existence of too much precedent <span id="Page_5181"></span>at a time when there existed an estimated thirty volumes of cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> Kirt Shuldberg, <span class="Italic">Digital Influence: Technology and Unpublished Opinions in the Federal Courts of Appeals,</span> 85 Cal. L. Rev. 531, 545 (1997), <span class="Italic">citing</span> John J. O'Connell, <span class="Italic">A Dissertation on Judicial Opinions</span>, 23 Temp. L.Q. 13, 14 (1949); and Edward H. Warren, <span class="Italic">The</span> <span class="Italic">Welter of Decisions</span>, 10 Ill. L. Rev. 472 (1916).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This foretold a more modern lament over the sheer volume of reported cases. "The law library of the future staggers the imagination as one thinks of multitudes of shelves which will stretch away into the dim distance, rank upon rank, and tier upon tier, all loaded with their many volumes of precious precedents. One shrinks from the contemplation of the intellectual giants who will be competent to keep track of the authorities and make briefs in those days; they, as well as the judges who pass upon the briefs, must needs be supermen indeed." Shuldberg, 85 Cal. L. Rev. at 545, <span class="Italic">citing</span> John B. Winslow, <span class="Italic">The Courts and the Papermills</span>, 10 Ill. L. Rev. 157, 158 (1915). The Judicial Conference of the United States has confirmed this fear:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In view of the rapidly growing number of published opinions of the courts of appeals and of the district courts of the United States, and the ever increasing practical difficulty and economic cost of establishing and maintaining accessible private and public law library facilities, the Committee presented the following resolution which was approved by the Conference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">RESOLVED: That the judges of the courts of appeals and the district courts authorize the publication of only those opinions which are of general precedential value and that opinions authorized to be published be succinct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States</span>, 11 (1964). Thereafter, the Judicial Conference in 1972 requested that all circuits develop an opinion publication plan. <span class="Italic">Report of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 33 (1972). The result was the approval of "unpublished" decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unpublished, or as this court calls them, nonprecedential decisions do not give the judiciary free will to reinvent the law; they merely permit a judgment about whether a case contributes significantly to the body of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. Cir. R. 47.6(b). They allow panels to determine if future panels and subordinate tribunals are to be bound by the ruling; the panel is still obligated to follow controlling precedent. This is a far cry from turning our back on precedent. Courts contribute to the growing imprecision, uncertainty and unpredictability of the law by issuing repetitive opinions on subjects that have been thoroughly irrigated. In our view, ideally once a principle has been established, it is up to the courts thereafter to apply it in cases coming before them and at most to explain their decisions to the parties, not to add to the explosion of legal opinions. Accordingly, we decline to consider the nonprecedential cases cited by Lemelson.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For most of the Board's history, it maintained that nonprecedential decisions of the Federal Circuit are not relied on by the MSPB, <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 545 (1993), and the Board has maintained that it will not use nonprecedential Federal Circuit decisions as precedents for its adjudications. <span class="Italic">Averill v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 327 (1986). AJs were discouraged from relying on nonprecedential opinions of the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Kotulak v. USDA</span>, 35 MSPR 111 (1987). Protestations of abstinence notwithstanding, once in a while the Board indulged in citation of a nonprecedential opinion, <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 29 MSPR 170, 175 n.8 (1985), but generally this is done to track the history of a Board decision rather than to demonstrate the existence of precedent. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 352, 354-55 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (citing a nonprecedential Federal Circuit decision as authority for a jurisdictional holding); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 405, 409 (1996) (MSPB relied on a nonprecedential decision of the Federal Circuit because "we are persuaded by the court's compelling rationale to resolve the inconsistency in the law on this issue."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McCrocklin v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3294) (citing a nonprecedential decision in a related case that was earlier decided by the Federal Circuit and served as a basis for the disposition of McCrocklin's appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Perhaps recognizing that nonprecedential decisions of the Federal Circuit contain analysis that is useful and that should become part of the public body of law, the Board started to make more abundant use of nonprecedential decisions of that court. <span class="Italic">Worley v. OPM,</span> 86 MSPR 237, 240 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (overruled on another issue, <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, 120 MSPR 440, 2013 MSPB 95 (2013)), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 MSPR 633, 637-38 (1997), the Board held that a person entitled to a monthly survivor annuity may not terminate that right in order to cause a lump-sum payment to be made, but that decision was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, No. 98-3053 (Fed. Cir. May 12, 1998) (Table). The court's decision was unpublished and is therefore not citable as precedent under the court's rules. However, we find the court's reasoning persuasive, and we adopt it, as follows and with additional analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Herring v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 90 MSPR 165, 170 n.* (2001), found the Board's use of a nonprecedential decision a little less guarded as the Board embraced the reasoning of the court with the observation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[*]&#x2003;The Board has previously held that it may rely on unpublished Federal Circuit decisions if it finds the court's reasoning persuasive. <span class="Italic">Worley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 MSPR 237, 240 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The logical extension of <span class="Italic">Herring</span> is that advocates may bring persuasive nonprecedential Federal Circuit decisions to the Board's attention in their briefs and arguments to both AJs and the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, n.4 (2022) ("The Board may rely on unpublished decisions of the Federal Circuit if it finds the court's reasoning persuasive, as we do here. <span class="Italic">Mauldin v.
