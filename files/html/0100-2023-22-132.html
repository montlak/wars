<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-132"><span class="space">a.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Hensley</span> </span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The theory of the compensation scheme for unsuccessful claims or issues is expressed by <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 40 (1983). The case was brought on behalf of individuals involuntarily confined at a psychiatric facility. The suit originally involved three claims: an unconstitutional denial of adequate treatment and living conditions; placement of patients in a maximum-security facility without due process; and failure of the state to compensate patients who performed institutional labor. By the time of trial, the only issue was the right to minimally adequate treatment. The trial court found constitutional violations in five of six contested general areas of treatment and institutional conditions. Plaintiffs' counsel sought fees under 42 USC 1988. The Supreme Court set the guidelines for those fees with particular reference to the time invested in unsuccessful components of the case, 103 S. Ct. at 1937-43:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The amount of the fee, of course, must be determined on the facts of each case. On this issue the House Report simply refers to 12 factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.</span>, 488 F.2d 714 (CA.5 1974).[3] The Senate Report cites to <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> as well and also refers to three District Court decisions that "correctly applied" the 12 factors.[4] One of the factors in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, "the amount involved and the results obtained," indicates that the level of a plaintiff's success is relevant to the amount of fees to be awarded. The importance of this relationship is confirmed in varying degrees by the other cases cited approvingly in the Senate Report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The 12 factors are: (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the "undesirability" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. 488 F.2d, at 717-719. These factors derive directly from the American Bar Association Code of Professional Responsibility, Disciplinary Rule 2-106 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;"It is intended that the amount of fees awarded...be governed by, the same standards which prevail in other types of equally complex Federal litigation, such as antitrust cases[,] and not be reduced because the rights involved may be nonpecuniary in nature. The appropriate standards, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express</span>, 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), are correctly applied in such cases as <span class="Italic">Stanford Daily v. Zurcher</span>, 64 F.R.D. 680 (ND Cal. 1974); <span class="Italic">Davis v. County of Los Angeles</span>, 8 E.P.D. &#x00B6; 9444 (CD Cal. 1974); and <span class="Italic">Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</span>, 66 F.R.D. 483 (WDNC 1975). These cases have resulted in fees which are adequate to attract competent counsel, but which do not produce windfalls to attorneys. In computing the fee, counsel for prevailing parties should be paid, as is traditional with attorneys compensated by a fee-paying client, 'for all time reasonably expended on a matter.' <span class="Italic">Davis, supra; Stanford Daily, supra</span> at 684." S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 6 (1976), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1976, pp. 5908, 5913.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4663"></span>...The legislative history...does not provide a definitive answer as to the proper standard for setting a fee award where the plaintiff has achieved only limited success. Consistent with the legislative history, Courts of Appeals generally have recognized the relevance of the results obtained to the amount of a fee award. They have adopted varying standards, however, for applying this principle in cases where the plaintiff did not succeed on all claims asserted.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Some Courts of Appeals have stated flatly that plaintiffs should not recover fees for any work on unsuccessful claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bartholomew v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A plaintiff must be a "prevailing party" to recover an attorney's fee under 1988. The standard for making this threshold determination has been framed in various ways. A typical formulation is that "plaintiffs may be considered 'prevailing parties' for attorney's fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit." <span class="Italic">Nadeau v. Helgemoe</span>, 581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (CA1 1978). This is a generous formulation that brings the plaintiff only across the statutory threshold. It remains for the district court to determine what fee is "reasonable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer's services. The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed. Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court also should exclude from this initial fee calculation hours that were not "reasonably expended." S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 6 (1976). Cases may be overstaffed, and the skill and experience of lawyers vary widely. Counsel for the prevailing party should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission. "In the private sector, 'billing judgment' is an important component in fee setting. It is no less important here. Hours that are not properly billed to one's client also are not properly billed to one's adversary pursuant to statutory authority." <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Marshall</span>, 205 U.S. App. D.C. 390, 401, 641 F.2d 880, 891 (1980) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate does not end the inquiry. There remain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward or downward, including the important factor of the "results obtained." This factor is particularly crucial where a plaintiff is deemed "prevailing" even though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief. In this situation two questions must be addressed. First, did the plaintiff fail to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded? Second, did the plaintiff achieve a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some cases a plaintiff may present in one lawsuit distinctly different claims for relief that are based on different facts and legal theories. In such a suit, even where the claims are brought against the same defendants--often an institution and its officers, as in this case--counsel's work on one claim will be unrelated to his work on another claim. Accordingly, work on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have been "expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved." <span class="Italic">Davis v. County of Los Angeles</span>, 8 E.P.D. at 5049. The congressional intent to limit awards to prevailing parties requires that these unrelated claims be treated as if they had been raised in separate lawsuits, and therefore no fee may be awarded for services on the unsuccessful claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It may well be that cases involving such unrelated claims are unlikely to arise with great frequency. Many civil rights cases will present only a single claim. In other cases the plaintiff's claims for relief will involve a common core of facts or will be based on related legal theories. Much of counsel's time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis. Such a lawsuit cannot be viewed as a series of discrete claims. Instead the district court should focus on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee. Normally this will encompass all hours reasonably expended on the litigation, and indeed in some cases of exceptional success an enhanced award may be justified. In these circumstances the fee award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. County of Los Angeles, supra</span>, at 5049. Litigants in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. The result is what matters.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;We agree with the District Court's rejection of "a mathematical approach comparing the total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon." Such a ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable fee in light of all the relevant factors. Nor is it necessarily significant that a prevailing plaintiff did not receive all the relief requested. For example, a plaintiff who failed to recover damages but obtained injunctive relief, or vice versa, may recover a fee award based on all hours reasonably expended if the relief obtained justified that expenditure of attorney time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the other hand, a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount. This will be true even where the plaintiff's claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith. Congress has not authorized an award of fees whenever it was reasonable for a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit or whenever conscientious counsel tried the case with devotion and skill. Again, the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Application of this principle is particularly important in complex civil rights litigation involving numerous challenges to institutional practices or conditions. This type of litigation is lengthy and demands many hours of lawyers' services. Although the plaintiff often may succeed in identifying some unlawful practices or conditions, the range of possible success is vast. That the plaintiff is a "prevailing party" therefore may say little about whether the expenditure of counsel's time was reasonable in relation to the success achieved. In this case, for example, the District Court's award of fees based on 2,557 hours worked may have been reasonable in light of the substantial relief obtained. But had respondents prevailed on only one of their six general claims, for example the claim that petitioners' visitation, mail, and telephone policies were overly restrictive...a fee award based on the claimed hours clearly would have been excessive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no precise rule or formula for making these determinations. The district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success. The court necessarily has discretion in making this equitable judgment. This discretion, however, must be exercised in light of the considerations we have identified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the extent of a plaintiff's success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an award of attorney's fees under 42 USC 1988. Where the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee. Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court did not adopt each contention raised. But where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained. On remand the District Court should determine the proper amount of the attorney's fee award in light of these standards.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained its view of <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> in <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 28 MSPR 176, 180-81 (1985), involving time spent on various issues that arose during an appeal from the termination of an individual accused of participating in the air traffic controllers' strike:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant next contends that the presiding official erred in granting fees only for time spent on issues on which appellant prevailed. Specifically, the presiding official denied appellant compensation for time spent in pursuit of claims such as whether the President was the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> deciding official, whether the agency committed harmful procedural error in processing appellant's removal, whether the Board's discovery orders impaired due process, and whether the Board can take official notice of a strike. Additionally, the presiding official denied appellant recovery for time spent on regional and national discovery. The total number of hours spent on these matters was 176, all of which were denied by the presiding <span id="Page_4664"></span>official. We find that the presiding official erred in his determination that fees could only be awarded for time spent pursuing the issue upon which appellant prevailed, namely, whether appellant's absence from work was caused by duress. The Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), that an award should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised. Litigants may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing the fee. The Court in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> distinguished that situation from one where the prevailing party's different claims for relief are based on different facts and legal theories. Time spent on such unrelated claims should not be compensated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Marshall</span>, 641 F.2d 880 (D.C. Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1327-28 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In the instant case, we find that all claims advanced by appellant, including those upon which he did not prevail, were based on the same facts and were not fractionable. Accordingly, counsel is entitled to be compensated for time reasonably spent on those issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit is reluctant to sustain fee reductions based on less than complete success on all related claims. <span class="Italic">Killeen v. OPM</span>, 414 Fed. Appx. 285, 288 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), noted that <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> warned against reducing fees for unsuccessful theories of recovery when the appellant obtains "excellent results" through the litigation leading to the fee request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Mr. Killeen was the prevailing party in this litigation. Not only did he succeed in having his annuity rate recalculated, but the specific proration factor argued by Mr. Killeen was correct and thus applied by this court. Because Mr. Killeen was unsuccessful in one of his assertions does not automatically warrant a reduction in the requested attorney fees. The net result of his efforts were successful--he sought to have his annuity rate increased and it was. While the amount of his annuity would have been higher if he had prevailed on both of his arguments, that does not mean he failed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reducing an attorney award when a prevailing party presents multiple legal theories and is only successful on some of the contentions is something the Supreme Court specifically cautioned against in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424, 434435 (1983). In <span class="Italic">Hensley,</span> the Supreme Court criticized the District Court's use of a mathematical formula comparing the total number of issues argued with those that actually prevailed as a method for determining the attorney fee award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 435-36 n.11. Rather than attempt to create some sort of ratio based on the percentage of winning arguments, the courts should carefully evaluate the facts and "where a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 435.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Killeen achieved excellent results. He prevailed in having his annuity recalculated and his efforts will undoubtedly affect other air traffic controllers who assume a part time work schedule during their careers. Consequently, the reduction in attorney fees by the Board on the basis that Mr. Killeen failed to prevail on all of his asserted claims constitutes an abuse of discretion. We <span class="Italic">reverse</span>. The Board is instructed to award the full amount of the attorney fees requested.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under EAJA, if there is but one claim and the plaintiff is successful, fees are not to be reduced because the recovery is limited but not insubstantial, <span class="Italic">Hitkansut LLC v. United States</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1884.Opinion.5-1-2020_1580986.pdf">958 F.3d 1162</a>, 1170 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hensley</span> concerns reduction of awards where "a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success" due to prevailing on less than all of its causes of action. 461 U.S. at 436, 440. In such a case, "the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 440. In this case, however, Hitkansut brought exactly one claim--infringement of the '722 patent--and prevailed on it. The fact that it obtained less monetary relief than it may have hoped does not mean that it obtained "limited success" as the term is used in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States' reliance on <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> is similarly founded on a quotation taken out of context. <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> states that "where recovery of private damages is the purpose of...litigation, a district court, in fixing fees, is obligated to give primary consideration to the amount of damages awarded as compared to the amount sought." 506 U.S. at 114-15. That statement, however, referred to a plaintiff who obtained only nominal damages. As the Supreme Court explained, "[a] plaintiff who seeks compensatory damages but receives no more than nominal damages" often "should receive no attorney's fees at all." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 115. This was true in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> because "[i]n a civil rights suit for damages...the awarding of nominal damages also highlights <span class="Italic">the plaintiff's failure to prove actual, compensable injury</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Because damages awarded under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1983, the statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, "must always be designed to compensate injuries," the Court held that a plaintiff who has not proven compensable injuries may not be entitled to attorneys' fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, Hitkansut did not "fail[&#8197;] to prove actual, compensable injury." At trial, it proved compensable injury based on expert testimony from both parties that the United States would have paid $200,000 for a one-time license to the '722 patent in a hypothetical negotiation. This was not a "technical, insignificant victory." <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 113 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, the portion of <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> relied upon by the United States, which is based on a plaintiff's failure to prove actual injury, is inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because Hitkansut succeeded on its sole claim, and proved a material amount of actual, compensable damages, the Claims Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to further reduce its award of attorneys' fees.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit cautioned against downward adjustment of the lodestar for the amount involved and results obtained in a Tucker Act lawsuit, <span class="Italic">Bywaters v. United States</span>, 670 F.3d 1221, 1230-31 (Fed. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> and later cases, we find that this case does not present the sort of "rare" and "exceptional" circumstance where the factor of "amount involved and results obtained" should be considered as a basis for departure from the lodestar figure. The mere fact that the recovery is small in amount is not a circumstance justifying a reduced fee award. <span class="Italic">See Millea v. Metro-North R.R. Co.</span>, 658 F.3d 154, 168 (2d Cir. 2011). The district court's conclusory statement that the "'amount involved and results obtained' factor [was] not adequately taken into account" in determining a reasonable fee, <span class="Italic">Attorneys' Fees Order</span>, 2010 WL 3212124, at *4, is also not sufficient, standing alone, to support a departure from the lodestar figure. While it is legitimate to consider the "amount involved and results obtained" in determining a reasonable attorney fee award, the district court should have considered this factor when determining the reasonable number of hours expended and the reasonable hourly rates of the attorneys. It is axiomatic that attorneys almost inevitably consider the amount involved in a particular case when determining a reasonable number of hours to expend on any given issue or when allocating personnel resources based upon the expertise or experience required. Where only a small amount is at stake, it certainly would not be reasonable to expend countless hours on such a small claim or to commit the most experienced or valued attorney in the firm to work on the case. Thus where the amount involved is small, reductions in the reasonable number of hours expended or the reason-able hourly rate can easily be made to reflect this fact. It is for this reason that the Supreme Court has held that the "results obtained" factor is generally subsumed within the lodestar calculation and thus normally should not provide an independent basis for a departure from the lodestar figure. <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, 465 U.S. at 900; <span class="Italic">see also Perdue</span>, 130 S. Ct. at 1674.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as the "amount involved and results obtained" can readily be incorporated into the lodestar figure, so too can the administrative nature of the work and the low level of skill involved, which the district court identified as alternative bases for reducing the lodestar figure. The district court's findings with respect to these factors can be fairly reflected by reducing the number of hours reasonably expended and the appropriate hourly rates of the attorneys. <span class="Italic">See Del. Valley</span>, 478 U.S. at 566 ("Because considerations concerning the quality of a prevailing party's counsel's representation normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate, the overall quality of performance ordinarily should not be used to adjust the lodestar...."); <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, 465 U.S. at 898-99 ("The novelty and complexity of the issues presumably were fully reflected in the number of billable hours recorded by counsel and thus do not warrant an...adjustment.&#8197;...Neither complexity nor novelty of the issues, therefore, is an appropriate factor in determining whether to increase the basic fee award.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reaffirming <span class="Italic">Bywaters</span>' disinclination to cut fees based on partial success--at least without careful articulation of the reasons for doing so--the Federal Circuit explained, <span class="Italic">Howard v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hen applying <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> step two, the Board made a downward adjustment to the lodestar on the basis that Mr. Howard did not obtain all the relief he requested, which is contrary to Supreme Court precedent. As this court thoroughly explained in <span class="Italic">Bywaters v. United States</span>, 670 F.3d 1221, 1228&#8722;30 (Fed. Cir. 2012), post-<span class="Italic">Hensley</span> Supreme Court decisions cabin the discretion to adjust the lodestar based on results obtained. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Bywaters</span> makes clear that a downward reduction to the lodestar should only occur in rare and exceptional cases and a fee award may not be adjusted based on a factor that is already subsumed within the lodestar. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1228&#8722;31; <span class="Italic">see also Perdue v. Kenny</span>, 559 U.S. 542, 552&#8722;54 (2010). The Board may exclude from the fee award hours Mr. Howard spent litigating an unsuccessful claim, <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 441, but to do so, it must either explain why the case is rare and exceptional (if applying an adjustment to the lodestar) or exclude those hours <span class="Italic">when calculating the lodestar</span>. <span class="Italic">See Bywaters</span>, 670 F.3d at 1231; <span class="Italic">see also Perdue v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that $225 per hour was a reasonable rate, and failed to eliminate all the hours devoted to the appellant's unsuccessful claims. In particular, the agency objects that the administrative judge awarded fees for all hours spent on various Board pleadings that only briefly addressed the November 7, 2007 counseling memorandum, and were devoted in part to claims on which the appellant did not prevail, e.g., the nonselections. The agency further contends that the administrative judge should not have awarded fees for hours spent on the preceding OSC complaint, as some of that time was also devoted to matters on which the appellant did not ultimately prevail. According to the agency, the administrative judge should have either attempted to segregate additional hours, or else reduced the award by a percentage to account for the appellant's limited success. In either event, the agency contends, the award of $27,373.50 is unreasonable, and renders the November 7, 2007 memorandum "the most expensive counseling memorandum in history." The appellant has responded to the agency's petition, but he does not contest the administrative judge's findings.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Determining a reasonable fee award</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant obtained relief on only one of the contested personnel actions, he was nonetheless a prevailing party in the underlying IRA appeal, and is therefore entitled to an award of reasonable fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g). <span class="Italic">See Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 612, 617-18 (1994). The question to be decided is the amount of the reasonable fee award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), the Supreme Court set forth a scheme for determining a reasonable fee award in a case where, as here, the prevailing party did not obtain all the relief requested. The most useful starting point, the Court explained, is to take the hours reasonably spent on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 433; <span class="Italic">see Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 10 (2011) This is the "lodestar" which the Board uses in determining the fee award. <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Navy</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 3, 7-8 (1989). The initial calculation should exclude hours for which the prevailing party failed to provide adequate documentation, and should also exclude hours that were not reasonably expended. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the second phase of the analysis, the lodestar may be adjusted upward or downward based on other considerations, including the crucial factor of the "results obtained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 434. In some cases, it may be appropriate to reduce the lodestar to reflect the party's failure to obtain all the relief he requested. However, as we explained in <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, a reduction of the lodestar to account for the party's success on only some of his claims for relief is distinct from a finding that the hours devoted to unsuccessful claims or issues were not reasonably spent. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 10. In accordance with <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> and <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, we will determine the hours that were reasonably spent on the underlying appeal as a whole before addressing what adjustment, if any, should be made to the lodestar in light of the appellant's incomplete success in the underlying IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, of the 166.16 hours initially claimed, 10.5 hours were devoted to a separate compliance proceeding on which the appellant did not prevail, and are therefore not compensable. The invoices also include 14 hours of attorney time devoted to the attorney fee petition itself, for which the appellant may be entitled to compensation. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 30. However, because the degree of success the appellant has obtained on his attorney fee motion is not the same as the degree of success he obtained on the underlying appeal, we will conduct a separate analysis of the hours claimed in connection with the attorney fee proceeding. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>

If, however, the administrative judge decides not to award fees for hours of service that are adequately documented by attorneys, she must identify those hours and articulate the reasons for their elimination. <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 191, 195 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, 827 F.2d 761 (Fed. Cir. 1987). If an administrative judge has concerns about deficiencies in a motion for attorney fees, she should afford the party an opportunity to address the matter before rejecting the claims. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 834 F.2d 1011, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, of all hours claimed, 7 hours, incurred on February 4, 2010, were unreasonably spent. It appears that the administrative judge may have eliminated those hours without first communicating her doubts to the appellant and providing him an opportunity to answer. <span class="Italic">See Wilson</span>, 834 F.2d at 1012; <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 12. However, since neither party has contested the administrative judge's finding on review, we will not disturb it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the decision of the administrative judge to include in the lodestar all hours reasonably devoted to the appellant's OSC complaint. Fees claimed for legal work performed in a related prior proceeding, such as the appellant's complaint before OSC, may be compensable if: (1) the claimed portion of work performed in the other proceeding was reasonable; and (2) and the work performed in the other proceeding, or some "discrete portion" of it, significantly contributed to the success of the Board proceeding and eliminated the need for work that would otherwise have been required in the Board proceeding. <span class="Italic">McGovern v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 399, 408 (1999). As a general rule, the Board will not exclude from a fee request time reasonably spent outside the Board proceeding but in furtherance of the same goal. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 157, 161 (1989), <span class="Italic">modified by Garstkiewicz v</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 476, 478-79 (1991). Because the exhaustion of administrative remedies before OSC is a jurisdictional prerequisite for filing an IRA appeal, the work performed in the OSC proceeding contributed significantly to the appellant's success before the Board. Moreover, we discern no error in the administrative judge's implicit finding that it is impossible to identify a "discrete portion" of that work which was solely responsible for the appellant's success on the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, excluding the 10.5 hours devoted to compliance issues, the 14 hours devoted to the attorney fee request itself, which we consider separately below, and the 7 hours which the administrative judge found to have been unreasonably spent, we conclude that 134.66 hours were reasonably spent on the OSC complaint and Board proceedings in the underlying IRA appeal. The initial lodestar is therefore to be calculated by multiplying those 134.66 hours by a reasonable hourly rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish the appropriate hourly rate, the attorney fee application must be accompanied by a copy of the fee agreement, if one exists, as well as evidence of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work. <span class="Italic">Casal</span>i, 81 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 9. The customary billing rate may be established by showing the hourly rate at which the attorney actually billed other clients for similar work during the period for which the attorney seeks fees, or, if the attorney has insufficient billings to establish a customary billing rate, then by affidavits from other attorneys in the community with similar experience stating their billing rates for similar work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant submitted with his initial filing a copy of the fee agreement that he and his counsel signed on March 25, 2009, which states, in pertinent part, that payment shall be earned at a rate of $225 per hour, and that "[i]t is agreed that the current reasonable and customary charges for [the attorney's] time is $225.00 per hour." In his affidavit, the appellant's attorney stated that $225 is a "median hourly rate for this geographical area, where fees for competent counselors range from $200.00 to $250.00 per hour, excluding outlier rates." He subsequently explained that $225 is his customary rate, the same hourly rate he has billed other MSPB clients for similar work during the period for which he seeks in this matter, and the same hourly rate he charges his non-MSPB clients, and that, as far as he is aware, there are no other attorneys in the community who regularly take on MSPB cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's evidence on this issue is sufficient. He has met his burden by establishing not only that he agreed to pay his attorney $225 per hour, but that $225 per hour is his attorney's customary rate. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 17 (2006) (the appellant established the appropriate hourly rate for an attorney fee award where his attorney submitted a copy of the fee arrangement showing that he charged the appellant $275 per hour, and an affidavit attesting that he charged other clients $275 per hour for similar work), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Shelton v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 177 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Multiplying the hourly rate of $225 by the 134.66 hours found to have been reasonably spent on the OSC and IRA proceedings yields an <span id="Page_4666"></span>initial lodestar figure of $30,298.50. We now turn to the question of what adjustment, if any, should be made to the lodestar in light of the appellant's limited success. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Adjusting the lodestar</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, a prevailing party makes more than one claim for relief, and the claims involve a common core or facts or are based on related legal theories, the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended. <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 618-19. In a case where the party seeking fees obtains "substantial" success, despite not succeeding on every claim or issue, he should recover a fully compensatory fee, encompassing all hours reasonably spent on the litigation. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 435. If, on the other hand, the party seeking fees has achieved only "partial or limited success"--which is inarguably the case here--an award based on the hours reasonably spent on the litigation as a whole times an hourly rate may be an excessive amount, even where the claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 436.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the latter scenario, the tribunal awarding fees has discretion to make an equitable judgment as to what reduction is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 436-37. It may adjust the lodestar downward by identifying specific hours that should be eliminated or, in the alternative, reducing the overall award to account for the limited degree of success. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 619. Our case law, as well as that of our reviewing court, indicates that the former method should be used in cases where it is practicable to segregate the hours devoted to related but unsuccessful claims, and that only in cases where the administrative judge is unable to do so should she impose a percentage reduction. <span class="Italic">See Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 619-20. Generally, the administrative judge is in a better position than the full Board to determine whether it is possible to reduce the award by specific hours, as she is more intimately familiar with the adjudication of the underlying appeal.[2] <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 28 (deferring to the administrative judge's decision to impose a percentage reduction). Even in cases where a percentage reduction is appropriate, it is the administrative judge who is in the better position to determine the appropriate amount of the reduction. <span class="Italic">See Smit</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 619.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency mistakenly cites <span class="Italic">Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 172, &#x00B6; 7 (1998), for the proposition that "if there was no hearing on the fee dispute, the Board's determinations on fee motions may be made without deference to the administrative judge." The holding of <span class="Italic">Howard</span> is limited to requests for attorney fees incurred in connection with attorney fee proceedings in which no hearing was held. Here, the appellant seeks fees incurred in connection with the underlying IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Howard</span> is pertinent only to the extent the appellant also seeks compensation for attorney fees incurred in connection with the instant proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge determined that it was possible to eliminate specific hours devoted to unsuccessful claims, and we find it appropriate to defer to her judgment on that point. <span class="Italic">Cf. Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6; 28. We also discern no error in her decision to eliminate 27 hours--including the 19 hours previously identified by the appellant--which she found to have been devoted exclusively to personnel actions on which the appellant did not prevail. We specifically reject the agency's suggestion that the additional 8 hours identified by the administrative judge were the "only" deductions made to account for the appellant's unsuccessful claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the resulting figure of $24,223.50 does not so shock the conscience that we should second-guess the administrative judge's considered judgment that the amount fairly reflects the appellant's degree of success. The fact that the appellant prevailed on one of five personnel actions does not entail that he should be awarded only a similar fraction of the fees requested. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35 (criticizing the district court's use of a mathematical formula comparing total number of issues argued with those that actually prevailed as a method for determining the attorney fee award). Furthermore, while the counseling memorandum alone may not be of great import, that is not the only measure, or even the most significant measure, of the appellant's success in this appeal. The Board did not merely order the agency to rescind that memorandum; it also made a public finding that the agency engaged in illegal whistleblowing reprisal, and referred the matter to OSC for investigation and possible disciplinary action against the responsible agency officials. The appellant has since alleged further retaliatory actions by the agency--including a notice of proposed suspension issued the day after the initial decision awarding attorney fees--and the Board's finding of whistleblowing reprisal in this case may offer him a significant advantage in any subsequent OSC or Board proceedings. Finally, the award of attorney fees in this or any other successful IRA appeal serves the public interest insofar as it may encourage employees and attorneys to pursue remedies for acts of whistleblowing reprisal, thereby discouraging agencies from engaging in such acts, which in turn serves the goal of eliminating government wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201 note, &#x00A7; 2(b) (purpose of the Whistleblower Protection Act is to "to strengthen and improve protection for the rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and help eliminate wrongdoing within the Government"). In sum, we find no basis for disturbing the portion of the award attributable to the OSC and IRA proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Additional fees</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to fees for hours expended on the OSC complaint and IRA appeal, the appellant is entitled to compensation for reasonable fees incurred with respect to his successful attorney fee petition. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 30; <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 162. Here, the administrative judge did not find that any of the hours claimed for work performed in connection with the attorney fee petition were unreasonably spent. Because no hearing was held in the attorney fee proceedings below, we need not defer to her determination that the 14 claimed hours were reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Howard</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 172, &#x00B6; 7. However, the agency has not disputed her finding on that point, and we discern no basis for disturbing it. <span class="Italic">See Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 30. Multiplying the 14 hours reasonably expended times an hourly rate of $225 yields a lodestar of $3150.00. Because the appellant has obtained substantial success with respect to his attorney fee petition, we award the entire sum. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Adding that figure to what we have found to be a reasonable fee award for the OSC complaint and IRA proceedings, we arrive at a total award of $27,373.50.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When a prevailing party makes more than one claim for relief, and the claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, the fee determination should reflect the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended. <span class="Italic">Guy v.

In making an equitable adjustment of attorney fees on account of a prevailing party's partial or limited success, the tribunal may adjust downward the "lodestar," the hours reasonably spent on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate, by identifying specific hours that should be eliminated or, in the alternative, by reducing the overall award to account for the limited degree of success. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433, 436-37; <span class="Italic">Guy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 20.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that, because the appellant initially sought relief from OPM's denial of her claim for a former spouse survivor annuity, no fees should be awarded for time expended prior to June 25, 2015, since on that date the Board issued its decision denying her claim and finding that she was not, in fact, entitled to that benefit. In response, the appellant contends that portion of the litigation also included consideration of the issue of whether she was at fault in creating and/or receiving the overpayment, an issue that also is critical in determining if she would have to pay it back.[7] The appellant's claim is borne out by the record. For example, in the appellant's September 16, 2010 request for reconsideration of OPM's decision finding that she was not entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity, she argued that, if OPM did not agree that she was entitled to the annuity, then repayment was inappropriate and waiver legally required under the circumstances. OPM, in its February 27, 2012 reconsideration decision, addressed both issues. On appeal, the administrative judge determined that the sole issues were whether there was an overpayment and, if so, whether the appellant was entitled to waiver, and, in his initial decision finding that she was entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity and therefore was not overpaid, the administrative judge further found that, even if there was an overpayment, the appellant was entitled to waiver based on financial hardship,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;To be entitled to waiver of an overpayment, the appellant is required to show that she was without fault in creating the overpayment and that recovery would be against equity and good conscience. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1401.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore agree with the appellant that both matters were at issue such that, as stated in his declaration, counsel's efforts pertained to both matters until the Board issued its decision on June 25, 2015. Nevertheless, it is not practicable to segregate the hours devoted to the appellant's unsuccessful challenge to OPM's denial of her request for a former spouse survivor annuity from the hours devoted to her successful claim for waiver of the overpayment. Therefore, we find it appropriate to reduce the overall award to account for the appellant's limited degree of <span id="Page_4667"></span>success. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436-37; <span class="Italic">Guy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6; 20. In so doing, we acknowledge that the Supreme Court has further addressed this issue post-<span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, for example, cautioning against "double counting" factors by adjusting the lodestar figure where the results obtained are fully reflected in the reasonable hourly rate of the attorneys and the reasonable number of hours expended. <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 899-900 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn</span>, 559 U.S. 542, 552-53 (2010), the Court reaffirmed that adjustments to the lodestar may be made only in "rare" and "exceptional" circumstances and that adjustments are warranted only where the lodestar figure fails to take into account a relevant consideration that is not subsumed therein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the lodestar figure, which we have not disturbed, fails to take into account that, while the appellant did succeed in not having to pay back the money she improperly received as Mr. Burns' former spouse, on the issue which formed the basis for her appeal at the outset, her entitlement to maintain the former spouse survivor annuity she had been receiving, she was not successful. Because the lodestar figure does not take into account this relevant consideration, we find that this case presents an exceptional circumstance such that the factor "amount involved and results obtained" should be considered as a basis for departure from the lodestar figure. <span class="Italic">Bywaters v. United States</span>, 670 F.3d 1221, 1230 (Fed. Cir. 2012). We therefore find it equitable to reduce by half the amount of fees requested for the time spent by counsel before June 25, 2015, and award the appellant $61,019.74 for this time.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In fact, the appellant originally sought recovery for only half of the attorney fees and expenses for the first part of the case, before remand, in "an exercise of billing judgment," although she subsequently reconsidered her position on this point and requested the full attorney fees and expenses for this part of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed previously, the appellant is also entitled to $13,178.91 for preparation of the fee motion, $6,532.00 for responding to OPM's motions, and $4,316.80 for responding to the administrative judge's order. Thus, the appellant is entitled to a total award of $85,047.45.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recovery of full fees was achieved by an appellant who prevailed on a prohibited personnel practice defense, but who did not prevail on other affirmative defenses and on one of the agency's charges, <span class="Italic">Freeman v. VA</span>, 66 MSPR 125, 133-34 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that, because the administrative judge sustained the patient abuse charge and rejected the appellant's affirmative defenses of race discrimination and retaliation for his equal employment opportunity activities, attorney fees incurred for those aspects of the case are not recoverable. If a party "fail[s] to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee." <span class="Italic">Morey v.

If, "however,...a 'lawsuit consists of related claims, a [party] who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because' he did not prevail on all of his contentions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440, 103 S. Ct. at 1943). Thus, attorney time spent formulating an unsuccessful argument advanced as an alternative ground for setting aside an adverse action, such as an unsuccessful affirmative defense, is compensable. <span class="Italic">See Flood v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 30 MSPR 546, 547 n.2 (1986) (relying on <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra</span>); <span class="Italic">Hanson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's unsuccessful argument that the patient abuse charge should not be sustained, and his two unsuccessful affirmative defenses, were "alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome," <span class="Italic">Hanson</span>, 28 MSPR at 181, namely, the setting aside of the removal. Attorney time devoted to those issues is compensable, since the appellant's argument that the agency removed him because of his whistleblowing was an additional alternative ground for setting aside the removal, and it was successful.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem of unrelated claims was considered in <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 611, 617-18 (1985). A footnote in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> was appended to the Board's disallowance of a portion of the fee demanded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also believe we must reduce this amount and that claimed for argument preparation to account for the time spent on distinct and unrelated claims which were unsuccessful.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Appellant's claims concerning the agency's promotion and early optional retirement decisions were completely separate from and unrelated to the merits of his removal or the disability retirement in lieu of removal issue on which he prevailed. The Court held that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to these claims,...and fees for time spent on them is not awardable under <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1940 (1983). We do not, however, treat separately the time spent on his reprisal claim, as to which appellant also was unsuccessful,...since this defense was, of course, related to his challenge to his removal. <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> does not require disallowance of such time, all of which should be allowed if otherwise reasonable when the prevailing party is entirely successful, as appellant was in obtaining cancellation of his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lizut</span> was revisited in <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 3, 8-9 (1989), involving time spent on the merits of an appeal, enforcement proceedings, and a security clearance challenge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hensley,</span> the Court held that the inquiry into a reasonable fee does not end after one has established the reasonable hours and the reasonable rate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The important factor of the results obtained may lead to an adjustment of the fee. The Court explained that this factor was particularly crucial where a party was deemed prevailing even though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief. In that situation, the Court stated, two questions must be addressed. First, did the party fail to prevail on claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he succeeded? Second, did the party achieve a level of success that made the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award? The Court emphasized that, in answering these questions, one was to consider whether the claims for relief involved a common core of facts, and, most importantly, the degree of success obtained. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also</span> <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 32 MSPR 643 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court distinguished between cases in which a plaintiff presented in one lawsuit distinctly different claims for relief that could not be deemed expended in pursuit of the ultimate result and cases where counsel's time was devoted to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis. <span class="Italic">Hensley,</span> 461 U.S. at 434, 103 S. Ct. at 1939. In the former situation, the Court held, the unrelated unsuccessful claims should be treated as if they had been raised in separate lawsuits, and no fee could be awarded for services on them. In the latter situation, which could not be viewed as a series of discrete claims, the fee award was to reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> reasoning to the appellant's compliance case, the Board finds that the hours related to a second removal action were not expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved, i.e., placing the appellant as closely as possible in the same position after the removal that he was in before it. The second removal action was distinct from the first removal action and the constructive suspension that gave rise to the successful back pay claim. Thus, the Board awards no fee for the twelve hours spent on the second removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the Board finds, with respect to the three identifiable and related compliance claims (claims for reinstatement of security clearance, for award of back pay, and for reversal of a suspension), that the appellant's level of success does not make the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for determining the fee award. Even though the appellant's claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith, the lodestar should be reduced to reflect the appellant's failure to receive the important relief of getting back his security clearance and to reflect his failure to show retaliation. The relief obtained, a back-pay award, although significant, is limited in comparison to the three-fold scope of the compliance matter as a whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hensley</span> permits reduction of the lodestar amount either by identifying the hours associated with the unsuccessful related claims or by "simply reducing the award to account for the limited success." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> at 436-37, 103 S. Ct. at 1941. Here it is impossible for the Board to identify precisely the hours associated with the related unsuccessful claims. We find, therefore, that simply reducing the claim is the fairer way to account for the limited success in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the importance of the relief sought and not obtained in the compliance matter (the reinstatement of a security clearance and the overturning of a suspension, <span class="Italic">see Lizut,</span> 30 MSPR at 116) and the substantial relief awarded (back pay), the Board finds that a small percentage reduction is proper. Thus, once the regional office determines the reasonable hourly rate and computes the lodestar, it shall reduce that amount by fifteen percent to account for the appellant's limited success in his compliance action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to separate but related claims, in the simplest statement of the Board's position, under <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 653, 657-58 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n cases such as this one, in which more than one claim for relief is made, and in which the claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, the attorney fees determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 135-36 (1987) [discussed in Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-022.html#sec12-22">Election Between EEO and Direct MSPB Appeal; Treatment of EEO Complaint</a>"].</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4668"></span>One of the Board's most clearly stated formulations of the <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> analysis is from <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 299, 304-05 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a party "fail[s] to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee." <span class="Italic">Morey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 604, 607 (1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 440, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1943, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983)). If, "however,...a 'lawsuit consists of related claims, a [party] who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because' he did not prevail on all of his contentions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440, 103 S. Ct. at 1943).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, attorney time spent formulating an unsuccessful argument advanced as an alternative ground for setting aside an adverse action, such as an unsuccessful affirmative defense, is compensable. <span class="Italic">See Flood v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 30 MSPR 546, 547 n.2 (1986) (relying on <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart, supra</span>); <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 28 MSPR 176, 180-81 (1985) (relying on <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>). By contrast, if an appellant makes multiple, distinct requests for relief in a single Board appeal, each of which could form the basis of a separate appeal, the Board will reduce claimed attorney fees, to reflect the degree of success obtained, if the appellant prevails on only some of the requests for relief<span class="Italic">. See Smit v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 612, 617, 619 (1994); <span class="Italic">Rothschild v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 54 MSPR 238, 242-43 (1992). In addition, if the Board decides not to award fees for hours of attorney service that are adequately documented, it must identify those hours and give a clear explanation for their elimination<span class="Italic">. Crumbaker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 191, 195 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">modified on other gds.</span>, 827 F.2d 761 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not make multiple, distinct requests for relief, only some of which were successful. Rather, he advanced several arguments in support of his sole contention that the penalty of removal was too severe for the misconduct to which he admitted. Not all of the arguments were found to be persuasive, but the appellant succeeded in having his removal set aside, and a 90-day suspension substituted in its place. Under the principles set forth above, then, the time spent on the arguments that were not found to be persuasive should not be disallowed on the ground of lack of success; indeed, the appellant succeeded on the only request for relief that he made. <span class="Italic">See Freeman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 66 MSPR 125, 130 (1995) (attorney time spent on affirmative defenses and other arguments for setting aside a removal was compensable, even though the contentions were not found to be persuasive, where the appellant succeeded in having his removal mitigated to a 90-day suspension; the rejected contentions were alternative grounds for a desired outcome, namely, having the adverse action set aside).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 66 MSPR 101, 105-06 (1995), again applied <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that when a litigant has obtained excellent results, the fee award should not be reduced simply because he failed to prevail on every claim raised. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 435, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983). Litigants may in good faith raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection of or failure to reach particular grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 435, 103 S. Ct. at 1940. The denial of fees for unsuccessful claims is dependent upon a finding that they are distinctly different from the successful claims, because they rest on different facts and legal theories. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 434-35, 103 S. Ct. at 1939-40. In a case where a litigant's claims for relief involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, however, the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation: the result is what matters. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 435, 103 S. Ct. at 1940.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, the appellant set forth several reasons for his allegation that the removal action had been improperly effected: (1) The evaluation of his compliance reviews and cases was inconsistent; (2) he was treated differently than his coworkers; (3) his unsatisfactory evaluations were based in part on the opinions of junior investigators; (4) his removal was based on a personality conflict with his supervisor; (5) he was denied a transfer from the Alabama Division; and (6) the agency changed prior policies to effect his removal. Because the removal action was rescinded after the agency admitted that it had not informed the appellant of the correct minimum level of performance required, these claims were not reached during the appeal. We find however, that these claims and the dispositive issue all addressed the general merits question of whether the agency's action could be sustained, and that they were based on the same underlying facts. The appellant's claims thus are not fractionable, and the fee determination should include compensation for time reasonably spent by Ms. Davis on those issues, because she obtained an excellent result (cancellation of the action) for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35, 103 S. Ct. at 1939-40; <span class="Italic">Kennard v. Department of Defense</span>, 33 MSPR 231, 234-35 (1987); <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 28 MSPR 176, 180-81 (1985). For these reasons, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, we reject the agency's argument that compensation is only appropriate for time spent on the dispositive issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Segregable defense procedures were the subject of fee analysis in <span class="Italic">Rothschild v. DHUD</span>, 54 MSPR 238, 242-43 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An inquiry as to whether a requested fee award is reasonable must address, in addition to the reasonableness of the requested hours and rate, the important factor of the results obtained. In a case in which more than one claim for relief is made, and in which the claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended. The results are an especially important factor when a party has prevailed on only some of his claims for relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Army</span>, 42 MSPR 3, 8 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1940, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that counsels' efforts to obtain a mandamus order from the court were expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved, the cancellation of the agency's actions and the reinstatement of the appellant to his former position. As a result of that action, initiated in March 1990, the agency designated a substitute deciding official and promptly issued a decision on the appellant's proposed removal, which had been pending since July 1989. Thus, a fee award is appropriate for the time spent seeking the mandamus order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not, however, award fees for counsels' work on a request that the Board stay the appealed actions. Although the request is related to this appeal in that it concerns the agency actions at issue in the appellant's appeal, and although the request appears to be non-frivolous and to have been raised in good faith, the appellant was not successful in that request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436, 103 S. Ct. at 1941 (the most critical factor in determining whether an award may include hours spent on related claims is the degree of success obtained); <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, 42 MSPR at 8-9. Further, in the request the appellant sought a stay, or temporary relief, a distinctly different form of relief from the cancellation of adverse personnel actions, the relief that the appellant ultimately sought and received. The difference between these two forms of relief is underscored by the fact that the Board provides separate proceedings for stay requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR part 1209, subpart B....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's view of <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> parallels that of the Federal Circuit. In a patent case involving a fee application, the Federal Circuit quoted with approval from <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>: "Litigants in good faith may raise alternative legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court's rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee. The result is what matters." <span class="Italic">Mathis v. Spears</span>, 857 F.2d 749 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In EAJA analysis in <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp</span>., FAA, 884 F.2d 1378, 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 1989), the court considered a fee claim based on a prevailing party's success in four of the six issues of his appeal: he prevailed as to back pay, the right to set off job search and relocation expenses against his interim employment income, and entitlement to back pay for the time needed to obtain release from his military position and move to his site of reinstatement; he lost as to the issues of grade progression relative to back pay entitlement, and the formula for overtime calculation. The court declined to define the issues as separate claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not consider this an appropriate case for fractional division of the attorney fee award. Division based on a mathematical count of issues was expressly disapproved in [<span class="Italic">Hensley</span>], 461 U.S. at 435, n.11, 103 S. Ct. at 1940 n.11. We do not adopt the government's count of pages of argument as demonstrating the "significance" of certain issues; on that basis the issues on which Mr. Naekel's position was strongest and the government's weakest...could receive disproportionately low recompense, and otherwise distort the effort actually expended. No fair basis or justification for allocation has been demonstrated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit also addressed the business of unsuccessful claims in <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388 (Fed. Cir. 1986). There the Board reduced the appellant's removal to a 90-day suspension. The court directed an award of fees for reasons discussed in the section of this chapter on "substantial innocence." As to the amount of time spent by counsel defending the charge that was sustained, it determined that if the fees were segregable, they should not be included in the award; and if the separation was not practical, or if the fees relating to the charge were <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span>, fees could be allowed for the whole case, or the Board could allow the amount of fees reasonable relative to the results achieved. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-22-084.html#sec15-85">Equal Access to Justice Act</a>," for additional decisions concerning unsuccessful claims and, in particular, <span class="Italic">Keely v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 1273 (Fed. Cir. 1986).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reducing all of this to practice before the Board, if, during an appeal, an appellant's counsel advances a position not adopted by the Board, the agency may argue that time spent on the unsuccessful attempt should not be compensated. The Board appears to take the position that if a party is otherwise entitled to a fee, the fact that the party did not prevail on some issues should not diminish the fee, as long as the issue is not distinct from or wholly unrelated to the principal claims advanced. <span class="Italic">Koch v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, <span id="Page_4669"></span>19 MSPR 219, 222 n.6 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Flood v. FERC</span>, 30 MSPR 546, 547-48 n.2 (1986) ("[t]he agency's argument that appellant's counsel should not be compensated on the two claims upon which appellant did not prevail was adequately addressed by the presiding official and is without merit. The two claims (that his job was abolished for reasons personal to him, and that the action was based on prohibited age discrimination) were alternative legal grounds for appellant's claim that he was denied his reassignment rights and any time spent on them would be compensable"). This approach was applied to the preparation of fee petitions containing some arguments that were not adopted by the Board. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 565, 568 (1985) ("Once a determination has been made that fees are warranted in the interest of justice, there is no authority to support the agency assertion that only those contentions in an attorney fee motion which are meritorious may be compensated as reasonable." (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), and <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 611, 617 n.11 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Only if the time spent is nonproductive, or spent on various legal theories that are truly fractionable and fail, should fees be denied for elements of the case that the appellant lost. <span class="Italic">National Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Logan v. DHUD</span>, 23 MSPR 345, 350 n.3 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Marshall</span>, 641 F.2d 880 (D.C. Cir. 1980)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 589 (1986) [discussed in Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-022.html#sec12-22">Election Between EEO and Direct MSPB Appeal; Treatment of EEO Complaint</a>"]. <span class="Italic">Logan</span> denied compensation for time spent on a motion for reconsideration filed with the AJ after the initial decision was issued and after a PFR had been filed; no procedure permits reconsideration by the AJ. Fees were awarded for an entire case presentation under <span class="Italic">Logan</span> and <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> when only one of three issues raised in the appellant's brief furthered his appeal. <span class="Italic">Bartel v. FAA</span>, 30 MSPR 451, 455-56 (1986). The question is whether the issues relate to a common core of facts and whether the claim is truly fractionable from those facts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 106, 113 (1987), added to the law of fractionable claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]ime spent by counsel on arguments he raised in his response regarding error in the initial decision which were unrelated to the agency's petition for review may not be compensable <span class="Italic">if</span> they are fractionable from the claims and legal theories on which the agency's petition was based or on which the petition was denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 40 MSPR 604, 611 (1989), noted that compensable time would be reduced for issues not successfully advanced in a petition for review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the appellant is entitled to only one-half of the hours, or 4.5 hours, he claims for his petition for review of the addendum initial decision on additional attorney fees. The appellant did not prevail on his contentions that he is entitled to fees for work done in connection with the issues of the petition for review and interest. We find that the issue on which the appellant has prevailed is not sufficiently related to the other issues to warrant payment of attorney fees for all work performed because the issues did not arise from the same common core of facts where there was an interrelationship between the facts and the legal theories, and the appellant did not achieve a level of success on these issues that makes the hours reasonably expended....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Compensation was not split in an appeal leading to reduction of removal to suspension, following reduction of several serious charges to one relatively minor charge. Very little time at the hearing, just nine pages of more than six hundred pages of the transcript, was devoted to direct and cross-examination on the surviving charge. As a result, the Board made no deduction for the time spent unsuccessfully attempting to prevail on that charge. <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 410, 413-14 (1987). A motion by an employee (ALJ) to dismiss an agency case, although unsuccessful, was compensable. It raised at least one issue that ultimately proved to be the linchpin of the case. The motion could not, given the relation between the factual issues raised in the motion, be considered sufficiently severable to permit a denial of fees. <span class="Italic">SSA v. Balaban</span>, 33 MSPR 309, 324 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If fees must be reduced, the AJ is in the best position to determine the degree of reduction. The appellant should supply sufficiently detailed records of time spent on various elements of the appeal if the AJ is to engage in a particularized, rather than general, approach toward reduction in fees, <span class="Italic">Smit v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 612, 619-20 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the fees are apportionable because the issue of the appellant's status as a whistleblower was established at the prehearing conference held May 29, 1992, and James Darby and Christopher Milner were the only witnesses necessary to the determination of the 1989 appraisal issue. In the memorandum of the May 29 conference, the administrative judge stated that the evidence showed that the appellant was a whistleblower and that she would not entertain further evidence on that issue....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find further, however, that it is proper to reduce the fees incurred from that point on to reflect the limited degree of success achieved. Even though the claims involve the same core of related circumstances, the appellant's level of success does not make the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for determining the fee award. <span class="Italic">See Lizut v. Department of the Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 3, 9 (1989) (even though the appellant's claims were interrelated, non-frivolous, and raised in good faith and he obtained a significant back-pay award, the lodestar should be reduced to reflect the appellant's failure to get back his security clearance and to reflect his failure to show retaliation). A fee can be reduced either by identifying the hours associated with the unsuccessful related claims or by "simply reducing the award to account for the limited success." <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436-37, 103 S. Ct. at 1941; <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, 42 MSPR at 9. We cannot identify precisely the hours associated with the related unsuccessful claims, at least in part because the appellant's documentation is not specific enough. Further, if the reduction must be made on a general basis rather than by specific hours, the administrative judge is better able to make such a determination because she is more intimately familiar with the adjudication of this appeal. Therefore, we remand this attorney fees request to the administrative judge for a further determination of the hours spent on the successful claim, after providing the parties an opportunity to supplement the record. If, on remand, the administrative judge is unable to identify a precise number of hours to disallow for the unsuccessful claims, she should reduce the award by an otherwise appropriate amount.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee provisions of the Reform Act and kindred statutes are compensatory, not punitive. Counsel for an appellant must zealously pursue a case, for this is their duty under the disciplinary rules that govern lawyers' conduct. Doctrines of collateral estoppel and <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> require all defensive theories to be presented to the Board in the course of an appeal from a single adverse or performance-based action. The claim before the Board in an appeal is the challenge to the action under review. EEO and prohibited personnel practice defenses are employed to advance the claim, that is, to overcome the agency action. Occasionally, although infrequently, multiple claims occur, e.g., the joinder of a step increase denial with a Chapter 43 removal, or the combination of an appeal from an indefinite suspension and a removal for misconduct. If the Board would recognize the unified nature of most appeals, that is, if the Board would acknowledge that most appeals involve a single claim that a given action should be set aside, the <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> complexities could be reduced; an AJ could focus on whether the time invested by appellant's counsel in the appeal is excessive.</p>
