<p class="Body-Text">The AJ will direct filing of a prehearing submission that includes a statement of the issues presented by the appeal and then foreclose consideration of other issues raised by the appellant during the hearing. After the prehearing conference, the prehearing conference memorandum or order from the AJ identifies and limits the issues that will be considered on appeal and the witnesses who are approved to testify. The memorandum may or may not deal with admission of exhibits. The AJ may prefer to admit exhibits as they are offered during the hearing rather than determine their admissibility during the prehearing conference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ivory v. GSA</span>, 45 MSPR 371, 374 n.2 (1990) (all defenses, including affirmative defenses, raised by the appellant should be memorialized in the prehearing conference memorandum). A party may not fail to amend its prehearing submission and then wait until the hearing to amend the prehearing order, prejudicing the other party by defeating its ability to defend against matters of substance raised through the changes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bratton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 180, 181 (1995) (despite testimony during hearing concerning reprisal, the AJ correctly decided not to consider an EEO reprisal allegation that was not raised prior to hearing and in prehearing summary); <span class="Italic">Jensen v. USDA</span>, 61 MSPR 469, 473 (1994) (no error when the AJ did not address an issue of EEO reprisal that was not stated as a claim by an appellant in an unchallenged prehearing conference memorandum); <span class="Italic">Tannehill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 219, 221 n.1 (1993) (appellant did not present the issue of disability discrimination in the prehearing submission, did not object to a prehearing conference memorandum that did not include discrimination as an issue, did not present evidence concerning discrimination at the hearing, did not argue that the AJ erred in stating in initial decision that discrimination was not alleged; the Board deemed the issue to be abandoned); <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 296, 300-01 (1993) ("The administrative judge's summaries did not include the actions cited by the appellant, and the record does not show that he objected to the administrative judge's summaries prior to the hearing. Thus, we will not consider the appellant's objections on review."); <span class="Italic">Crowe v. SBA,</span> 53 MSPR 631, 634 (1992) (issue is not properly before the Board where it is not included in the AJ's memorandum summarizing the prehearing conference and stating that no other issues will be considered unless either party objects to the exclusion of that issue from the summary); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 212, 215 (1991) (issue was precluded when it was not covered by the prehearing memo and the record contained no written request from either party seeking to modify the AJ's delineation of the matter(s) at issue); <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 661, 670 n.8 (1991) (declining to consider a reprisal allegation first presented in the posthearing brief when the AJ's prehearing conference memo did not include that issue but did state that the parties were to present objections to the contents of the memo; neither side filed objections); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 28 MSPR 535, 537 (1985) (AJ properly did not address the propriety of a competitive level when the appellant did not raise that issue in her prehearing submissions); <span class="Italic">Alfaro v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 628, 630 (1983) ("[A]t the time of the hearing appellant had no reason to know that the agency would move to amend the order as to the dates charged, and he therefore was not prepared to defend charges related to August 6.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the parties should carefully review prehearing conference memoranda or orders to ensure they accurately reflect the decisions made during the prehearing conference, the AJ has a duty to ensure the memoranda or order are accurate and complete, a point emphasized in <span class="Italic">Ivory v. GSA</span>, 45 MSPR 371, 375 (1990), remanding a case for consideration of an EEO issue that was not precluded by the prehearing memorandum but was not addressed by the AJ. A prehearing conference memorandum must be clearly made known to a party before the party can be procedurally faulted. If direction concerning the case is contained in a status conference memorandum, the appellant must be served with a copy of that memo and given the opportunity to comment on it before that party is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the summary. <span class="Italic">Fontanilla v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 312, 316 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The prehearing conference memorandum should not inadvertently exclude essential issues. In <span class="Italic">Hill v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 278, 281 (1989), two reasons were stated for the appellant's termination: first, the appellant falsely stated on his employment application that he was not discharged from other employment; second, the appellant omitted reference in his application to a prior position he lost by termination. In his memorandum of a prehearing conference, the AJ stated the issues to include falsification, but the AJ made no mention of the charge that the appellant omitted information from his application. After the AJ ruled for the appellant, the agency protested the AJ's failure to decide the second issue. The Board remanded the case for further consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Notwithstanding the fact that the administrative judge advised the parties to notify him if they disagreed with his memorandum, nothing in the record indicates that the agency ever abandoned the portion of its charge specifying that the appellant had omitted critical information about his past employment in his application. That the agency never intended to withdraw this contention is bolstered by the fact that the agency noted it as an issue in its prehearing submission and then presented corroboration on the issue at the hearing without objection from the appellant or the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although issues not identified in the prehearing conference memorandum are not preserved for appeal, if the issues are not properly identified by the AJ, the Board may allow the issues to be raised through a PFR, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. DOD,</span> PH-1221-11-0313-W-2 (NP 5/1/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An issue is not properly before the Board if it is not included in the administrative judge's memorandum summarizing the prehearing conference, which states that no other issues will be considered, unless either party objects to the exclusion of that issue in the summary. <span class="Italic">See Crowe v. Small Business Administration</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 631, 634-35 (1992). In the memorandum summarizing the prehearing conference, the administrative judge only identified the agency's 2001 reassignment action as the alleged personnel action raised on appeal by the appellant. The appellant's attorney filed a prehearing brief disagreeing with the administrative judge's "restrictive view" of the personnel actions before the Board as one reassignment action "where Appellant was alleging a pattern of non-promotions, and non-compliance with the terms of past agreements between Appellant and the agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's attorney did not reassert his objection at the beginning of the hearing, although the administrative judge informed the parties in the prehearing conference summary that "[a]ny objection to this summary may be made on the record at the beginning of the hearing." Moreover, in the prehearing conference summary, the administrative judge did not inform the parties that the only issue he would consider was the appellant's 2001 reassignment unless either party objected to the exclusion of a specific issue from the summary. Moreover, the appellant attempted to reassert her other alleged personnel actions during the hearing, but the administrative judge limited her to the 2001 reassignment action. Based on the appellant's efforts below to raise other personnel actions, we find that the appellant is not precluded from raising the administrative judge's failure to address her remaining issues on review. <span class="Italic">See Durr v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 16 n.2 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as <span id="Page_1350"></span>well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests. <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980). In the initial decision, the administrative judge did not address the appellant's allegation that her September 8, 2002 reassignment was whistleblower retaliation. The administrative judge also failed to address the appellant's claim that the agency engaged in an ongoing pattern of retaliation by repeatedly failing to promote her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge did not address these issues in the initial decision, we must remand this appeal to the administrative judge for consideration of the remaining issues the appellant raised on appeal, which may include issues not otherwise identified in this order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miles v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 102 MSPR 316, 322 &#x00B6; 18, 2006 MSPB 169 (2006), remanded an appeal because the appellant raised affirmative reprisal defenses in an adverse action case, but the AJ never ruled upon them. The appellant did not abandon those defenses when they were not mentioned in a written prehearing order and the AJ did not otherwise state the defenses would or would not be considered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the AJ may exclude consideration of issues not identified in the prehearing conference memorandum, <span class="Italic">Roof v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 653, 658 (1992) (the AJ properly declined to consider the issues of the appellant's medical condition and disparate penalties when those issues were not identified in the prehearing submissions), the AJ's treatment of unidentified issues is discretionary; but it should be reasoned. If a party fails to comply with a prehearing conference memorandum and offers material in evidence that should have been, but was not, identified in the order, the AJ must exercise his or her discretion to determine whether to accept the evidence. If the AJ errs in that ruling, the error must still be shown to be prejudicial before it will have an impact on the outcome of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 241, 249-50 (1989) (material admitted in the hearing was questioned as to its authenticity but the challenge was not particularized).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ's prehearing memorandum summarizing the issues and burdens of proof should be provided to the parties in time sufficient to permit them to apply the information provided by the memo at the hearing. If the memo is provided only briefly before the hearing, an appellant may have a legitimate concern as to the ability to prepare for the hearing, although an objection will likely be analyzed under a theory of harmful error, the burden on the appellant to show the resultant harm, <span class="Italic">McCurry v. DOJ</span>, 612 Fed. Appx. 991, 995 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We agree with McCurry that the timing of the AJ's notice is troublesome, at least for <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioners such as McCurry. The AJ informed the parties of their burdens under USERRA and <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> during the February 20 prehearing conference. The AJ also included the same instructions in the February 21 order detailing the topics discussed during the prehearing conference. Thus, notice was provided only four days before the February 25 hearing and after discovery deadlines had passed. On the same day that the AJ informed McCurry of her burdens under USERRA and <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, the AJ also appeared to require McCurry to identify all witnesses and exhibits she would present during the hearing. This rendered the substantive value of the AJ's notification almost meaningless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of the problematic nature of the timing of the AJ's notice, we nevertheless conclude that the Board properly upheld the AJ's denial of McCurry's request for corrective action. The AJ eventually allowed the parties to submit evidence and objections until the February 25 hearing, notwithstanding any deadlines in prior discovery orders. This curative approach somewhat mitigates any prejudice that transpired due to USERRA and <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span> notice occurring after the close of discovery....</p>
