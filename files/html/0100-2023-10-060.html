<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Mississippi Army Nat'l Guard and ACT</span>, 57 FLRA 337, 339-40 (2001), explained the basis for permitting organization of National Guard technicians, excepted service dual status employees who must become and remain members of the National Guard while maintaining the particular military grade specified for their civilian positions under 32 USC 709(a) and (b) (the Technicians Act):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The MSNG is an "Agency" or an "Activity" that is subject to the Authority's jurisdiction and to the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Guard has both state and federal functions.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See New Jersey Air Nat'l Guard v. FLRA, </span>677 F.2d 276, 278-79 (3d Cir. 1982) <span class="Italic">(New Jersey National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard) </span>(the National Guard is hybrid with both state and federal functions). Because the National Guard is not a full-time active force, it employs civilian 'technicians' to perform administrative, clerical, and technical tasks. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense, Nat'l Guard</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau, Rhode Island Nat'l Guard, Rhode Island v.</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA, </span>982 F.2d 577, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1993). These technicians are federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2105. When the state National Guards administer the technicians program, they act in their federal capacity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Technicians Act, 32 USC &#x00A7; 709(d) (the Secretary of the Army or the Air Force, as the case may be, shall designate the adjutants general...to...employ and administer the technicians authorized by this section).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal case law makes clear that state National Guard units act as federal agencies in matters concerning the employment of technicians.[4] Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held that in matters arising under the Statute, the Guard is being sued in its capacity as a federal agency. <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Puerto</span> <span class="Italic">Rico Nat'l Guard, </span>No. 99-1293 (1st Cir. Nov. 23, 1999) (unpublished). <span class="Italic">See also Arkansas Nat'l Guard v. FLRA,</span> No. 99-1563 (8th Cir. Aug. 30, 1999) (unpublished); <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Arkansas Nat'l Guard, </span>No. 99-1974 (8th Cir. Oct. 14, 1999) (unpublished) (granting FLRA's petition for enforcement against a state National Guard).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gilliam v. Miller</span>, 973 F.2d 760, 762 (9th Cir. 1992) (We agree that the [Oregon Adjutant General's] personnel actions as supervisor over the federal civilian technicians are taken in the capacity of a federal agency.); <span class="Italic">NeSmith v. Fulton, </span>615 F.2d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1980) (finding that the Adjutant General was a federal agency with respect to technician employment, and finding further that the fact that an adjutant general is a state officer does not preclude his simultaneously being a federal agency); <span class="Italic">Chaudoin v. Atkinson, </span>494 F.2d 1323, 1329 (3d Cir. 1974) (there can be no doubt that the Adjutant General of Delaware is an agency or an agent of the United States [in administering the technician program]).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the Statute is not constitutional to the extent that it applies to guard technicians. However, as set forth above, several circuit courts of appeal have found that national guard technicians may be in bargaining units. Further, we have no authority to review the constitutionality of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d 537, 540 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity relies on <span class="Italic">Printz, </span>521 U.S. at 935, for the contention that the Federal government may not impose duties on state officials and, therefore, cannot compel the state officials to participate in the Federal labor relations program. <span class="Italic">Printz</span> concerned the implementation of handgun registration under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. In <span class="Italic">Printz, </span>the Court held that the Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program (background checks in that case). However, nothing in <span class="Italic">Printz </span>is inconsistent with our conclusion that, unlike the program involved in <span class="Italic">Printz, </span>the National Guard is a federal program, and when the state National Guards administer the technicians program, they act in their federal capacity. In this regard, the Technicians Act gives the guard technicians dual status as Federal civilian employees and as members of the States' national guards/militia. Nothing in the Activity's arguments demonstrates that the State of Mississippi is in any way exempted from or excluded from the Technicians Act while administering the technicians program. Accordingly, the Activity's reliance on <span class="Italic">Printz </span>is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Activity's contention that the Authority has no jurisdiction over it is without merit and provides no basis for review of the RD's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico ANG, </span>56 FLRA at 177-78; <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Defense, Nat'l Guard Bureau, 55 </span>FLRA 657, 660-61 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;A bargaining unit may contain guard technicians</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the case involves a military--as opposed to civilian--controversy and that, therefore, the Authority lacks jurisdiction. Military matters are generally not justiciable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wright v. Park,</span> 5 F.3d 586, 590-91 (1st Cir. 1993). Although the Authority does not have jurisdiction over military matters, it does have jurisdiction over civilian matters that arise under the Statute. As set forth below, this case relates to the civilian aspect of technician employment, and, as a result, we conclude that the Authority has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that there is both a military and a civilian aspect to technician employment. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., NFFE, Local 1669, </span>55 FLRA 63, 66-67 (1999) (union proposal regarding technician uniforms relates to civilian aspect of technician employment and, therefore, is within the Guard's duty to bargain), <span class="Italic">enforced sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom.

FLRA</span>, 852 F.2d 1349 (D.C. Cir. 1988) <span class="Italic">(NFFE, Local 1623).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The long-standing precedent on this point is supported by both the language [5] and legislative history [6] of the Technicians Act. In addition, the technicians' dual status has been recognized by virtually every court and administrative forum to address the issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1623</span>, 852 F.2d 1349; <span class="Italic">Kostan v.

<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Technicians Act states that a technician employed under the Act is an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States. 32 USC &#x00A7; 709(e). The Technicians Act not only establishes the civilian character of technician employment, but also reflects Congress' intent that technicians have the same collective bargaining rights as other federal employees. In this regard, subsections 709(f) and (g) exempt technicians from specific provisions of Title 5 of the United States Code, but do not exempt them from the Statute. Therefore, the guard technicians fit within the definition of an "employee" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Mississippi Nat'l Guard</span> litigation was litigated through a Declaratory Judgment Act suit in federal court in the government's unsuccessful attempt to avoid the result reached by the FLRA. <span class="Italic">Lipscomb v. FLRA</span>, 333 F.3d 611, 613-20 (5th Cir. 2003), concluded that National Guard technicians are federal employees subject to the FSLMRS:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that the civilian technicians, clearly federal employees by virtue of the National Guard Technicians Act, Pub. L. No. 90-486, 82 Stat. 775 (codified as amended at 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 (2003)), are included under the terms of the FSLMRA as federal employees of an Executive agency. We further find that the AG--as an employer of these federal employees along with the MSNG and MSANG, which organizations operate under the AG's authority and direction, are federal executive agencies for the purpose of the FSLMRA, and consequently are subject to the jurisdiction of the FLRA. Accordingly, we agree with the district court and AFFIRM, its judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin our consideration of this appeal with full recognition that the national guard is the militia, in modern-day form, that is reserved to <span id="page_86"></span>the states by Art. I &#x00A7; 8, cls. 15, 16 of the Constitution. <span class="Italic">Maryland v. United States, </span>381 U.S. 41, 46, 85 S. Ct. 1293, 14 L. Ed.2d 205 (1965). However, in the modern-day federal scheme, the national guard has come to occupy a unique place. It has become, by design, a "hybrid" entity that carefully combines both federal and state characteristics, sometimes distinctly and sometimes not. The second Militia clause of the federal Constitution illustrates this duality, reserving "to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress." Const. art. I, &#x00A7; 8, cl. 16. The daily operations of the national guard units are thus recognized generally to be under the control of the states, but governed largely by substantive federal law. Under the National Defense Act, 39 Stat. 166, passed in 1916, the guard has been trained in accordance with federal standards and is armed and funded by the United States government. The Army National Guard of the United States is a component of the Army, and is made up of the federally recognized units and organizations of the Army National Guards in the respective fifty states. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3062, 10105. This dual federal-state nature of the national guard system has remained essentially unchallenged, as the Supreme Court has observed. <span class="Italic">Perpich v. Department of Defense, </span>496 U.S. 334, 347, 110 S. Ct. 2418, 110 L. Ed.2d 312 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to its part-time, purely military personnel, the national guard employs full-time civilian workers, described as national guard technicians. These civilian technicians--the object of the union's organizing efforts here--are employed by and perform the daily operations of the state guard units, but are funded by the federal government. Despite their state character, these employees were explicitly granted federal employee status in 1968 when Congress enacted the Technicians Act. "In 1968, Congress was reacting to a situation in which national guard technicians were considered state employees and consequently were not assured of uniform treatment with respect to fringe benefits or retirement plans." <span class="Italic">New Jersey Air National Guard v. FLRA, </span>677 F.2d 276, 28384 (3d Cir. 1982) <span class="Italic">("New Jersey Guard </span>"). To provide uniformity and afford national guard technicians the emoluments of federal service, "all Guard technicians, who had previously been employees of the states, were declared to be federal employees, and were thereby afforded the benefits and rights generally provided for federal employees in the civil service<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 279. Thus, through an act of Congress, national guard technicians are by design "dual-status" employees. <span class="Italic">See Brown v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States, </span>227 F.3d 295, 298 (5th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Vandiver</span>, 494 F.2d 830, 832 (5th Cir. 1974) ("The principal purpose of the National Guard Technicians Act...was to create a bifurcated nature of technician employment....)"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In granting technicians federal employee status under the Technicians Act, Congress was nonetheless concerned with protecting the military authority of the states. Accordingly, "federal employee status was carefully hinged upon the reservations set out in section 709[(f)] of certain powers to the state adjutants general." <span class="Italic">New Jersey Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 284. "[S]ection 709[(f)], which ensures the authority of the state adjutants general, can be viewed as a virtual <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for the section 709[(e)] grant of federal employee status<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Numerous courts, after reviewing the legislative history of the Technicians Act, have held that the matters explicitly reserved to the discretion of the adjutants general by section 709(f) reflect Congress's careful compromise, and thus are beyond the scope of bargaining under the under the FSLMRA.[1] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., New York Council Assn of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502, 505 (2d Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Indiana Air National Guard v. FLRA, </span>712 F.2d 1187, 1190, n.3 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">State of Nebraska Military Department, Office of the Adjutant General v. FLRA, </span>705 F.2d 945 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">California National Guard v. FLRA, </span>697 F.2d 874 (9th Cir. 1983). These decisions recognized and safeguarded the careful state-federal power balance struck by Congress in enacting the Technicians Act; "it was necessary to carefully craft the legislation so as not to compromise the essential military requirements of state guard service." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2953 v. FLRA, </span>730 F.2d 1534, 1543 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Section 709(f) reflects that deliberate calibration, and the courts, interpreting portions of the Technicians Act as exceptions to the FSLMRA's broad coverage, have found it to be a substantial check on the scope of the FLRA's authority.[2] We now turn to examine more closely the act under which the FLRA attempts to assert jurisdiction over the MSANG.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;The current section 709(f) was previously 709(e) and is referred to as such in cases prior to the 1999 Amendments, Pub. L. 106--65, &#x00A7; 524, which rewrote parts of &#x00A7; 709. This opinion will refer to the current statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;It is worth noting that the FLRA itself protects this balance, rejecting unions' efforts to encroach on the discretion of the adjutants general by seeking to force bargaining over certain, excepted terms and conditions of technicians' employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2953 v. FLRA, </span>730 F.2d 1534, 1541 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (affirming FLRA's decision upholding the national guard's refusal to bargain over matters that would conflict with the mandate of the Technicians Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 brought about a new era of labor-management relations for the federal service. Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 111, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101, <span class="Italic">et seq. </span>Title VII of the Reform Act, the FSLMRA, governs the labor relations of most federal employees with the federal government. The FSLMRA "grants federal agency employees the right to organize, provides for collective bargaining, and defines various unfair labor practices. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(a)(1), 7116. It creates the FLRA, which is responsible for administering the statute through the exercise of broad adjudicatory, policymaking and rulemaking powers, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7104, 7105." <span class="Italic">Natl Federation of Federal Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1309 v. Dept of Interior, </span>526 U.S. 86, 88, 119 S. Ct. 1003, 143 L. Ed.2d 171 (1999). The Act applies to employees of an "Executive agency," &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)-(3), and states that "each employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right." &#x00A7; 7102. Notably, the Act specifically exempts certain Executive agencies from coverage, including the General Accounting Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others. <span class="Italic">See </span>&#x00A7; 7103(a)(3)(A)(H). Although members of the uniformed services are explicitly exempted, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(B)(ii), the national guard as such is not mentioned, nor are the civilian technicians employed thereby. Thus, we turn to address the next question (and now we begin to get into a thicket), whether the civilian technicians of the MSANG are "employees of an Executive agency" of the federal government within the meaning of the FSLMRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Technicians Act, a civilian technician in a state national guard is statutorily "an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e). It is thus indisputable that the technicians of the MSANG are "employees of an Executive agency" under the coverage terms of the FSLMRA. They therefore have the right to choose union representation, as indeed numerous cases have acknowledged. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Civilian Technicians, Schenectady Chap.</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA, </span>230 F.3d 377, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (observing that, as federal employees, the guard's civilian technicians are entitled to engage in collective bargaining over certain matters); <span class="Italic">New York Council, Assn of</span> <span class="Italic">Civilian Technicians v. FLRA. </span>757 F.2d 502, 508 (2d Cir. 1985) (noting that federal employees' labor relations are governed by the Civil Service Reform Act, and applying the Act to national guard technicians); <span class="Italic">New Jersey Guard, </span>677 F.2d at 284 (noting the FSLMRA exempts certain executive agency employees from coverage, but because it does not reference the national guard or its technicians, it applies to them).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, Adjutant General Lipscomb maintains that the MSANG, the MSNG, and the AG are not subject to the jurisdiction of the FLRA because, while the technicians are federal employees for certain purposes, these entities that directly employ and supervise them are not federal "Executive agencies" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(3), nor does their employment of the technicians constitute "federal activities" of an agency under 5 C.F.R. 2421.4.[3] Consequently, to the extent that these technicians may be considered federal employees of the appellants, Adjutant General Lipscomb argues, they are not "employees of a federal Executive agency" within the meaning of the FSLMRA and are not subject to its coverage. The question is thus reduced to whether these state national guard entities are "federal executive agencies" for purposes of the FSLMRA, because if they are, they are plainly covered within its terms. Although many courts have had occasion to review various aspects of the Technicians Act and its interaction with the FSLMRA, it appears that no court of appeals has addressed the jurisdictional questions from the perspective raised by Lipscomb in this case. All of the decisions analyzing FLRA orders and actions taken with respect to the various state national guard organizations apparently have accepted without question the jurisdiction of the FLRA over them and their related entities, but only by virtue of the federal status of the employees, not the status of their employer.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.4 defines "Activity" as it is used in the regulations implementing the FSLMRA. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. 2420.1 (purpose of subchapter is to implement Chapter 71 of Title 5, governing Labor-Management Relations). Section 2421.4 states that "Activity means any facility, organizational entity or geographical subdivision or any combination thereof, of any agency."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Even the MSNG, now contesting the FLRA's authority over it, has appeared previously before the FLRA to contest the appropriateness of a proposed bargaining unit, apparently without raising the jurisdictional objection now presented. <span class="Italic">Mississippi National Guard Mates Shop, Camp Shelby and Association of Civilian Technicians, Inc.</span>, 12 F.L.R.A. 618 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We should make reference to another factor (which we have earlier noted) that burdens appellants' argument that none of them is an "Executive agency." By the express terms of the Technicians Act, the civilian technicians of the MSANG--bifurcated though the nature of their employment may be--are declared to be federal employees of an Executive agency, i.e., <span id="page_87"></span>the Department of the Army. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e). As such, it would seem that they are, by definition, statutorily entitled to the union organizational rights created for federal employees by the FSLMRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians</span>, 230 F.3d at 378. Yet, given how the issue is framed in this case, we must consider whether the Adjutant General, as the designated employer of these particular federal employees, and the entities he oversees, are federal agencies for the purpose of the FSLMRA, and are thus subject to the jurisdiction of the FLRA.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Certainly, nothing in this opinion expands the scope of the Mississippi National Guard's duty to bargain; we are <span class="Italic">not</span> called upon to examine any of the areas reserved by &#x00A7; 709(f) to the sole discretion of the adjutants general of the states. We proceed with the utmost caution, fully cognizant of the unique role and duty the national guard plays in the defense of this nation, as well as the special role the states have in administering the national guard and the Technicians Act; we do not purport to subject the national guard to any greater burden in its labor relations than that permissible under the existing law. We merely hold that the federal employees employed by the AG and MSANG are entitled to the rights afforded the rest of the non-excepted federal civilian employees, and recognized in countless court decisions affecting numerous national guard units and entities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;The Adjutant General</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first examine the status of the Adjutant General in determining whether the FLRA properly asserts jurisdiction over the MSANG and MSNG.&#x2003;The appellants admit, as they must, that the AG is an employer, indeed the ultimate employer, of these federal employees as provided under an act of Congress, the Technicians Act. They also acknowledge that he is the officer with ultimate control over and responsibility for the MSNG and MSANG under state law. It follows from the undisputed federal status of the technicians that their employer and supervisor is, at the very least, an employer of federal employees. By any ordinary standard of reasoning, it would seem incontrovertible, in the absence of a contrary statutory definition [6] that a statutory employer of regular and permanent federal employees, is a "federal employer"; and, consequently, that a federal employer of such federal employees of the Executive Department, with the authority to direct and supervise all of their day-to-day work, must constitute, at least in some recognizable, if limited sense, an "agency" of the Executive branch of the federal government.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(3) defines "agency" as "an Executive agency including a nonappropriated fund instrumentality described in section 2105(c) of this title and the Veterans' Canteen Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, the Library of Congress, the Government Printing Office, and the Smithsonian Institution but does not include--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;the General Accounting Office;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;the Federal Bureau of Investigation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;the Central Intelligence Agency;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;the National Security Agency;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(E)&#x2003;the Tennessee Valley Authority;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(F)&#x2003;the Federal Labor Relations Authority;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(G)&#x2003;the Federal Service Impasses Panel; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(H)&#x2003;the United States Secret Service and the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We find that the broad and somewhat circular terms of the statutory definitions of agency and Executive agency are non-dispositive in resolving the specific question that this appeal presents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yet the AG argues that because of his purely state character as an officer appointed by the state, in charge only of the state militia under Article I, &#x00A7; 8 of the Constitution, with authority primarily drawn from state statutes--and with no federal statute expressly defining him as a "federal executive agency"--he is not, under the terms of the FSLMRA (defining coverage as employees of an "Executive agency"), subject to the jurisdiction of the FLRA. We must admit that if one is searching for translucent, definitional, statutory words under the FSLMRA stating that the entities composing the Mississippi National Guard constitute an "Executive agency," the search will be disappointing. But yet our consideration of the many factors to which we have alluded--most arising from the Technicians Act--leaves no doubt that the hybrid character of the AG includes a federal component, which in his capacity as employer of the technicians renders him an "Executive agency." As one court has observed, Section 709 "charges the adjutant generals with employment and administration of the civilian technicians who are federal employees. In view of the foregoing there can be no doubt that the Adjutant General of Delaware is an agency or an agent of the United States and therefore within the purview of &#x00A7; 1361 [providing action for mandamus in district courts against federal officers or agencies]." <span class="Italic">Chaudoin v. Atkinson, </span>494 F.2d 1323, 1329 (3d Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, in <span class="Italic">NeSmith v. Fulton</span>, 615 F.2d 196, 198 (5th Cir. 1980), this Court held that the AG is <span class="Italic">itself </span>a federal agency, despite its status as a state office, because of the federal nature of the employees the AG supervises and the substantive federal law that governs the AG's duties. "The conclusion that an adjutant general is a federal agency as well as a state officer reflects the hybrid state-federal character of the National Guard and the role of adjutants general in administering it<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 199. Although this holding was applied to resolve a procedural issue, the court's conclusion in <span class="Italic">NeSmith</span>--that the AG is itself a federal agency--constitutes precedent that, even without other considerations to which we have alluded, will control the outcome of this case. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Chaudoin</span>, 494 F.2d at 1329; <span class="Italic">Gilliam v. Miller</span>, 973 F.2d 760, 762 (9th Cir. 1992) (Oregon AG's personnel actions taken as supervisor of the federal civilian technicians were taken in the capacity of a federal agency, for purposes of determining whether the federal Administrative Procedures Act applies). In short, the AG constitutes an "Executive agency" for the purposes of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because of the federal character that the AG assumes under the Technicians Act, and because the FLRA asserts its jurisdiction over these entities only in their federal capacities, Appellants' remaining arguments, based on the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the federal Constitution and the state character of the AG, must fail.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The AG relies on the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the Constitution to avoid the FLRA's assertion of jurisdiction over it. Appellants argue that the application of the FSLMRA to the AG amounts to conscription of a state official into the performance of a federal duty in violation of the Tenth Amendment. <span class="Italic">Printz v. United States, </span>521 U.S. 898, 117 S. Ct. 2365, 138 L. Ed.2d 914 (1997). The conclusion that the AG is a federal agency. subject to the FSLMRA in its federal capacity, renders Printz inapposite.</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B.</span> <span class="Italic">The Mississippi National Guard &#x0026; The Mississippi Army National Guard</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AG argues, however, that even if the AG is a federal agency, this appeal still is not resolved. He points out that the FLRA does not seek to assert its jurisdiction over the AG--that is to say, the AG is not a respondent to the underlying agency proceedings. Instead, only the MSNG and MSANG--the entities to which the technicians are assigned--are named as the employer parties in the proceedings before the FLRA. In this connection, the district court held that MSNG is a federal executive agency for purposes of the FSLMRA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(3), and that MSANG is an "activity" of a federal agency under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.4 ("Activity means any facility, organizational entity, or geographical subdivision or any combination thereof, of any agency."), and thus they are subject to the obligations of the FSLMRA. The district court concluded that MSANG is an "activity" of the Department of the Army, because it is recognized as a part of the Army National Guard of the United States. Lipscomb argues that neither the MSNG or the MSANG are agencies, and that the MSANG, by whom the instant technicians are employed, is not an "activity" of a federal agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we must say that once we have determined that the AG is a federal executive agency, it requires little exercise in reasoning for us to conclude that the MSANG and MSNG are executive agencies for the purpose of FLRA authority and this legal proceeding. This is true because they exist and operate under the authoritative direction and control of the adjutant general--indeed they are merely the adjuncts of his office, under whom, and on whose behalf, civilian technicians work.</p>

Code. &#x00A7; 33-3-3, and he "shall provide for and be responsible for the organization, training, tactical employment, and discipline of the Mississippi National Guard...." Miss.Code. &#x00A7; 33-3-11. This includes the supervision and authorization of the Assistant Adjutants General for Army and Air. <span class="Italic">See e.g., </span>Miss.Code. &#x00A7; 33-3-9 (Assistant Adjutant General for Army "shall aid the Adjutant General by the performance of such duties as may be assigned to him"). It follows that, to the extent that the AG acts as an executive agency of the federal government, when the AG acts through the MSNG and MSANG in carrying out his federal duties--as he does here as the employer of the technicians--they likewise are departments of the federal agency of the AG--or if one chooses to use the words of the federal regulations, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, these organizations are "activities" of a federal agency. Certainly, the appellants have offered no basis for us to reject this rationale, plainly dictated by a common sense reading of the applicable state statutes when considered in the light of our holding that the AG constitutes a federal executive agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the appellants have provided us with no persuasive reason to <span id="page_88"></span>reject decades of settled practice and the decisions of our sister circuits, which have upheld the organizational rights of national guard civilian technicians under the FSLMRA. Although neither we nor other appellate courts have previously addressed the precise arguments presented in this appeal, the resolution of the ultimate jurisdictional question presented is straightforward: Federal employees of federal executive agencies, with the noted statutory exceptions, are entitled to exercise the rights provided in the FSLMRA. The civilian technicians are non-excluded federal employees under the Act, and the AG employs those civilian technicians; as the federal employer of these federal employees, with full authority over such federal employees, the AG is--notwithstanding his dual capacity as a military officer of the State of Mississippi--an agency of the executive department of the federal government in the context of these proceedings, as are his organizational adjuncts in the exercise of that employer-related authority over federal employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, for the reasons set out above, the appellants have failed to demonstrate that the district court erred in denying to them a declaratory judgment that the FLRA has no authority over the MSANG to order an election among the technicians in its service. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint for declaratory relief is AFFIRMED.</p>
