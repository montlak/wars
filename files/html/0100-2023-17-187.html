<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-185"><span class="space">a.</span> Arbitrator May Direct Remedies Without Reconstructing the Action Management Should Have Taken</h5>
<p class="noindent">Rounding out one cycle of revision of preexisting law<span class="Italic">, FLRA</span> eliminated <span class="Italic">BEP</span>'s "reconstruction"<span class="Italic"> requirement. </span>In 2010, FLRA issued <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU Chap. 273</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-020.html">65 FLRA 102</a>, 102-112 (2010) (Chairman Pope's concurring opinion is set out below following the majority opinion), involving a grievance over the results of an award nomination, having the purpose and effect of eliminating Prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test and giving arbitrators freedom to develop remedies "reasonably related to the negotiated provisions at issue and the harm being remedied" without the necessity of stating what management would have done absent the violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to fairly and equitably process the grievant's nomination for a Corporate Success Award (CSA). As a remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to award the grievant a CSA, with appropriate backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The questions presented here are whether the award impermissibly affects management's rights to assign work and direct employees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B), and whether the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case provides the Authority an opportunity to reexamine the restrictions that the Authority has placed on arbitrators' remedial powers in rendering awards that affect management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. The revised approach that we formulate for this and future cases, discussed in &#x00A7; IV.C. of this decision, gives arbitrators the same scope of remedial authority in such management rights cases as they routinely exercise in rendering awards that do not affect management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we deny the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance claims that the Agency violated various Agency procedures and agreements with the Union when the Agency denied the grievant a CSA.&#x2003;A CSA is an annual award that provides Agency employees recognized as "top contributors" with a three percent increase in basic pay.... The percentage of employees to be recognized as "top contributors" in 2004 for their work in 2003 was to be set by the Agency's Chairman at "no less than 33 1/3 percent" of bargaining unit employees. Compensation Agreement, &#x00A7; II.C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's CSA procedures for identifying top contributors are set forth in the Agency's "Procedures for Processing [CSAs]" Memorandum (the Memorandum) and "FDIC Directive System Circular 2420.1," Ch. 11, &#x00A7; 5 (Circular 2420.1). Circular 2420.1 is incorporated by reference in a Memorandum of Understanding between the parties (MOU).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained the grievance.&#x2003;The Arbitrator held that the Agency violated the agreed-upon CSA selection process outlined in Circular 2420.1 and deprived the grievant of fair and equitable consideration for receipt of a CSA. In the Arbitrator's view, the DRD Panel erred when it substituted another individual for the grievant. The Arbitrator found no evidence that the negotiated CSA selection process provided for the initiation of new nominations or for the removal of existing nominees at that stage of the process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the Agency "compromise[d] the selection [p]rocess[,]" the Arbitrator addressed the remedy. Determining that re-running the CSA selection process would be "too problematic" to monitor and manage, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to grant the grievant a CSA for 2003 with appropriate backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions of the Parties</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency's Exceptions </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency presents two exceptions.[3] First, the Agency contends that the award is contrary to law because it impermissibly affects management's rights to assign work and to direct employees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B). Second, the Agency claims that the award fails to draw its essence from the Compensation Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority as a result of its exceptions claiming that: (1) the award impermissibly affects management's rights to assign work and to direct employees, and (2) the award fails to draw its essence from the agreement. An exception claiming that arbitrators have exceeded their authority requires a showing that they have failed to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolved an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregarded specific limitations on their authority, or awarded relief to those not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1617,</span> 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). As the Agency makes no specific argument to this effect, to the extent that this language was intended to constitute a separate exception, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority and deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues in its first exception that the Arbitrator's award is deficient under the two-prong standard that has been used by the Authority to determine whether an award impermissibly affects management rights set forth in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.,</span> 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). The two <span class="Italic">BEP</span> prongs are explained at &#x00A7; IV.A., below. The Agency only challenges the award under <span class="Italic">BEP</span>'s second prong. The Agency contends that the award fails to satisfy <span class="Italic">BEP</span> prong II because the award does not reflect a reconstruction of what the Agency would have done if it had not violated the agreed-upon CSA selection process. According to the Agency, even assuming that the Arbitrator properly found that the Agency "violated the contract," he erroneously awarded the grievant a CSA pursuant to the Compensation Agreement without determining that the grievant actually deserved an award. The Agency claims that, although there may have been a flaw in the application of the CSA selection process to the grievant, "management would still have had to determine whether the [g]rievant was in the top one-third of contributors" for the grievant to receive a CSA. The Agency requests that the Authority modify the award to require the Agency only to reconsider the grievant for a CSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Authority has decided to revisit the issue of arbitrators' remedial authority when it entertains exceptions alleging that an award or arbitral remedy impermissibly affects management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. Our focus is on the analysis that applies after the Authority has determined that an award provides a remedy for a violation of a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Current Case Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legal framework that the Authority currently applies when analyzing arbitrators' awards claimed to impermissibly affect management rights set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a) is stated in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 151-54. The framework set forth in that decision has two prongs, both of which must be satisfied for an award to be upheld.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I, the Authority examines whether an award that affects management rights provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 152-53 (reexamining the Authority's precedent in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>)); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv.</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-14 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>). If the award does not provide such a remedy, then the award is contrary to law and cannot be upheld. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Northampton, Mass., </span>53 FLRA 1743, 1746 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prong I's companion requirement, the reconstruction prong or "prong II," focuses on whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or the contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 154. As with prong I, awards that fail to satisfy the reconstruction prong are not sustained. Thus, awards that fail to satisfy either prong of the Authority's current legal framework will be set aside, modified, or remanded. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Origins and Development of Current Case Law </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has modified both parts of its legal framework from time to time to reflect its own evolving understanding of the Statute's requirements and the nature of arbitration as Congress intended it to function in federal sector labor-management relations. This was the case when, for example, the Authority in <span class="Italic">BEP </span>determined that the legal framework referred to as prong I should be applied generally to arbitration awards claimed to affect management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">See BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2012"></span>Drawing on prior precedent dealing with management's right to discipline, the Authority held in <span class="Italic">BEP </span>that there was no basis in the Statute for not applying the same approach when reviewing awards claimed to affect other management rights in &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Birmingham, Ala.</span>, 51 FLRA 270, 274 (1995) (<span class="Italic">VA Birmingham</span>)). As the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, on which <span class="Italic">VA Birmingham </span>relied,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[w]e are committed to the Statute's provision for final and binding arbitration and its purpose of facilitating the resolution of disputes. These are best served by ensuring that the decision of an arbitrator, selected by both parties to interpret and apply their collective bargaining agreement, will not be overridden on management rights grounds in order to relieve one party from the unwelcome result of that purposeful choice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 316.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This same commitment to Congress' determination to use final and binding arbitration to facilitate and encourage the resolution of disputes under the Statute is evident in the evolution of the reconstruction requirement of the Authority's legal framework, prong II. The reconstruction requirement is traceable to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 30 FLRA 1156 (1988) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Authority reexamined the remedial authority of arbitrators, based on its understanding of "the functions that arbitrators perform, and that Congress intended that arbitrators perform, under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1161 (quoting <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 635-36 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Authority rejected previously established restrictions on arbitrators' remedial authority; i.e., that arbitrators may not substitute their judgment for that of management when arbitrators resolve grievances over performance appraisal matters. Finding such a restriction "not warranted," the Authority held that arbitrators could exercise broader remedial power, substituting their judgment for that of management, when an arbitrator's remedy reflected a reconstruction of what management would have done had it acted properly. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 30 FLRA at 1160. In the Authority's view, exercising this broader remedial discretion</p>
<p class="noindent-2">would not require an arbitrator to do anything other than what arbitrators do routinely in resolving other disputes, including those involving...other management rights.... This is precisely one of the functions that arbitrators perform,...under the Statute. In requiring parties to negotiate grievance procedures that result in binding arbitration, and in broadly defining what grievances could encompass, Congress fully expected arbitrators to review a wide variety of actions, including actions taken by management pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1161 (quoting <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span>, 30 FLRA at 635-36). The Authority concluded: "To the extent that the resolution of grievances by arbitrators in this manner conflicts with &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) or (B), that conflict results from implementation of congressionally mandated grievance and arbitration procedures." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1162.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority subsequently extended its <span class="Italic">SSA </span>reconstruction precedent to arbitrators' awards claimed to impermissibly interfere with management rights other than those associated with performance appraisal matters. <span class="Italic">VA Birmingham</span>, 51 FLRA at 274.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Continuing concerns about grievance arbitration's efficacy under the Statute have led to criticism of the Authority's reconstruction precedent. This criticism was expressed in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Boston Region (Region 1)</span>, 57 FLRA 264 (2001) (Member Wasserman, dissenting) (<span class="Italic">SSA Boston</span>). In <span class="Italic">SSA </span>Boston, the arbitrator found that a supervisor's search of the grievant's desk and related actions violated various contractual provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision, the Authority's majority acknowledged that the Authority's reconstruction requirement "ma[d]e it difficult [for the arbitrator] to construct meaningful remedies" in the case. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 269. Nevertheless, finding the arbitrator's remedy "not a proper reconstruction," the majority set it aside, depriving the grievant of any make whole-type remedy for the contract violation the arbitrator found. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Member Donald S.&#x2003;Wasserman, one of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>'s two original authors, dissented. The dissent found the majority's decision "bad law," and the reconstruction requirement "a framework that does not fit all cases and has no basis in the Statute." <span class="Italic">SSA, Boston</span>, 57 FLRA at 270, 272 (Dissenting Opinion of Member Wasserman). Agreeing with the majority that reconstruction in the case was "not feasible," the dissent argued that "the requirement of reconstruction in all situations [i]s one that is not dictated by the Statute or the Supreme Court's decision in [<span class="Italic">IRS</span>].... [A]pplication of prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>properly and adequately protects management prerogatives under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 270. As for congressional intent, in the dissent's view, "when Congress authorized negotiations on matters covered in &#x00A7; 7106(b), that authorization included arbitration awards which give effect to those &#x00A7; 7106(b) matters the parties agree to negotiate.... In short, when Congress authorized bargaining on &#x00A7; 7106(b) matters, it also authorized arbitrators to issue awards to remedy violations of those provisions." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 273.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent in <span class="Italic">SSA Boston </span>therefore disagreed with the majority's view "that the [reconstruction] standard is necessary to ensure that an agency's &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights are limited only to the extent bargained by the parties." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 272. Rather, the dissent concluded, "it is by means of an essence challenge that impositions of contractual constraints never agreed to are addressed." <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon reexamination of the "reconstruction" standard reflected in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>'s second prong, and as discussed in the following section, we determine that such a standard is not required by the Statute and, indeed, unduly limits the appropriate remedial authority of arbitrators. It is sufficient that an arbitrator's award that affects management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Approach To Be Followed With Respect To The Remedial Authority of Arbitrators--Elimination of the Reconstruction Requirement </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concludes that the restriction on arbitrators' remedial authority imposed by <span class="Italic">BEP</span>'s reconstruction requirement is not warranted. Rather, subject to any specific limitations set forth in the pertinent contract and to the requirement that an award provide a remedy for a properly negotiated contract provision, an arbitrator enjoys broad discretion to remedy a meritorious grievance even if the remedy affects management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a). Exercise of this broad remedial discretion effectuates &#x00A7; 7106(a)'s explicit direction that management rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a) are "subject to" provisions bargained under &#x00A7; 7106(b), and that "nothing in" &#x00A7; 7106 shall preclude the parties from negotiating such provisions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b). This broad remedial discretion exists even if, due to insufficient record evidence or other reasons, the arbitrator does not "reconstruct" what management would have done but for the legal or contract violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This approach is more consistent with the Statute and better serves the Statute's purpose of facilitating and encouraging the settlement of disputes than <span class="Italic">BEP</span>'s reconstruction requirement. Neither the Statute's language nor its structure mandates particular arbitral remedies. To the contrary, Congress gave arbitrators extensive authority. "In requiring parties to negotiate grievance procedures that result in binding arbitration and in broadly defining what grievances could encompass, Congress fully expected arbitrators to review a wide variety of actions, including actions taken by management pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106." <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 30 FLRA at 1161. This wide-ranging authority includes authority to render meaningful remedies tailored to the circumstances of particular cases. We find no indication that Congress intended to limit arbitrators' discretion in ordering such meaningful remedies by mandating remedies that "reconstruct" what agency management would have done if the agency had not violated law or its agreement with the exclusive representative. Accordingly, Authority decisions that impose a reconstruction requirement will no longer be followed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FDIC, </span>61 FLRA 738 (2006) (Chairman Cabaniss, writing separately); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 61 FLRA 315 (2005) (then-Member Pope, dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is thus our intent to reaffirm the Statute's policy of giving deference to arbitrators' wide-ranging remedial authority. However, such remedial authority is not unfettered. Rather, an arbitrator's award must still be reasonably related to the negotiated provisions at issue and the harm being remedied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This limitation on arbitral remedy is not intended to establish a new two-pronged analytical framework that will be recited in every case involving an award alleged to violate management rights. We include the point simply to underscore for the parties and the arbitral community the legal requirements that apply to such awards. As in other types of arbitration cases, such awards must still withstand challenges raised in exceptions that the award does not satisfy the standards Congress established in the Statute for the Authority's review of arbitrators' awards. Where such a challenge establishes that an award imposes a constraint on management rights that was not agreed to by the parties, whether on essence grounds or otherwise, the award will be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On a practical level, parties to a collective bargaining agreement understand that (absent an express exclusion of a particular matter from arbitration) a violation of a negotiated contract provision is subject to being remedied by an arbitrator exercising his broad authority to remedy such violations. If an agency is concerned that the arbitral remedy for violating a particular contract proposal would impermissibly affect management rights, the agency need not agree to the proposal. However, if an agency agrees to include in its collective bargaining agreement a provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b), and that provision is applied by an arbitrator in a way reasonably related to the provision and the harm being remedied, a subsequent challenge to such an award is likely to be rejected by the Authority.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2013"></span>[6]&#x2003;Our concurring colleague claims that, under the new approach that we outline today, arbitrators' remedies "no longer may be found deficient based on management rights[.]" Concurring Opinion of Chairman Pope at 17. However, our colleague does not identify where in our decision we have said this--and indeed, we have not. The approach that we set forth today remains true to the Statute--and deviates not at all from the <span class="Italic">BEP</span>/prong two approach that we are discarding--in this fundamental way: An arbitral remedy that affects management rights and is challenged on that basis will not be upheld if it enforces a contractual restraint on management rights for which the parties did not bargain pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Revised Analytical Framework</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytical framework described above, we conclude that the award in this case is not contrary to law. We also conclude that the award does not fail to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. We therefore deny the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not contrary to law. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's exception arguing that the award's remedy is contrary to law.[7] This exception is based entirely on the assertion that the remedy does not reflect a reconstruction of what the Agency would have done if it had not violated the agreed-upon CSA selection process. As explained above, such "reconstruction" is not the standard to be applied to the remedy directed by an arbitrator. Moreover, the Agency concedes that the award enforces a properly negotiated contract provision. Consequently, we conclude that the award does not impermissibly affect management rights by failing to reconstruct what the Agency would have done if it had not violated the contract, and we deny the Agency's contrary to law exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Although the Agency's contrary to law arguments are sometimes presented as an "exceeds authority" exception, we construe them to be a "contrary to law" exception. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, Def. Contract Mgmt. Agency, </span>59 FLRA 396, 398 n.6 (2003) (agency's argument that the arbitration award affected management rights set forth as an "exceeded authority" exception construed to be a "contrary to law" exception).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's award does not fail to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's claim that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. In reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, the Authority applies the deferential standard of review that federal courts use in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Labor (OSHA)</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990) (<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>). The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the remedy portion of the award fails to draw its essence from the Compensation Agreement and should be set aside for two reasons.&#x2003;First, according to the Agency, the award is inconsistent with the Compensation Agreement, which requires that CSAs be granted only to top contributors. The Agency points out that the grievant has not been determined to be a top contributor. Second, the Agency claims that, if it were required to award the grievant a CSA, more than one-third of bargaining unit employees would receive CSAs, assertedly in violation of the Compensation Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's first argument, the record shows that the grievant's performance was at least sufficient for him to be nominated for a CSA by his first level supervisor, second and third level reviewers, Field Supervisors, and the ARDs under the negotiated CSA nomination procedures. Based on the facts in the record, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See OSHA</span>, 34 FLRA at 575.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's second argument also lacks merit. The Compensation Agreement provides that "[t]he Chairman has sole discretion to set the percentage of bargaining unit employees who will be recognized as top contributors under the CSA program[,]" so long as that percentage is "no less than 33 1/3 percent." The Agreement's plain wording reflects that this is a minimum, and not a maximum, as argued by the Agency. <span class="Italic">See FDIC, </span>62 FLRA 356, 359 (2008) (<span class="Italic">FDIC I</span>) (holding that the Compensation Agreement's 33 1/3 percent figure "is a minimum, not a maximum").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, although the Compensation Agreement does not obligate the Agency to award CSAs to employees who are not in the top one-third of contributors, it also does not cap the number of bargaining unit employees eligible to receive CSAs at 33 1/3 percent. Consequently, awarding a CSA to the grievant does not necessarily preclude compliance with the requirements of the Compensation Agreement. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion on this point is not altered by the Compensation Agreement's language leaving it to the "sole discretion" of the Chairman to set the percentage of unit employees eligible to receive a CSA. The agreement includes other language mandating "fair and equitable treatment" for CSA candidates. To the extent there is tension between these agreement provisions, we cannot say that the arbitrator's conclusion, that the grievant should receive a CSA, is not a plausible interpretation of the agreement as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the award fails to draw its essence from the Compensation Agreement. We therefore deny the Agency's exception.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, we are aware of our decision in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 64 FLRA 79 (2009) (Chairman Pope dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">FDIC II</span>), remanding on essence grounds an award arguably similar to the award in the instant case. To the extent that <span class="Italic">FDIC II </span>is inconsistent with prior precedent represented by <span class="Italic">FDIC I </span>and our reasoning in the instant case, <span class="Italic">FDIC II </span>will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Opinion of Chairman Pope, concurring in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority has decided that arbitral remedies may be challenged on private sector grounds only; remedies no longer may be found deficient based on management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. The majority's decision is flatly contrary to the Statute. Accordingly, although I agree with the ultimate conclusion to deny the Agency's exception in this case, I write separately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(a) provides that "<span class="Italic">Subject to subsection (b)..., nothing in this chapter shall affect" </span>the exercise of the management rights set forth therein. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a) (emphasis added). An agency's authority to exercise the particular rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) are constrained also by "applicable laws." The Supreme Court has instructed that the words "nothing in this chapter" mean "nothing in the entire" Statute, including grievance arbitration under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922, 928 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). Accordingly, as relevant here, only those constraints on management rights properly negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) are enforceable in arbitration. Put differently, "nothing" means "nothing outside &#x00A7; 7106(b)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the Statute and the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Authority established the two-pronged test set forth in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>).[3] The first prong of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>asks, if raised in an exception, whether an arbitration award provides a remedy for a violation of "a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to section 7106(a) that are set forth in section 7106(b)." [4] <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 153. The second prong of that test--which the majority eliminates--inquires, if raised in an exception, whether the awarded remedy constitutes a reconstruction of what management would have done had it complied with the relevant contract provision. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;As set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the two-prong test was merely an extension of a similar limitation established years earlier with regard to awards resolving disputes over awards raising employees' performance ratings. 53 FLRA at 151 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA</span>, 34 FLRA 323 (1990)). Moreover, since at least 1984, the Authority has held that, consistent with management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C), an arbitrator may not award a promotion absent a finding that "but for" the agency's contract violation, the grievant would have been selected for promotion. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 15 FLRA 543 (1984). I note that, since <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, twenty-four awards have been found deficient based on the second prong, including one award that was set aside over my dissent. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Tex. Nat'l Guard, Austin, Tex.</span>, 59 FLRA 437 (2003) (then-Member Pope dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;By decision issued today in <span class="Italic">United States Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 116-18 (2010) (Member Beck concurring), the Authority has modified its approach for resolving exceptions alleging that a contract provision is not enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b) and, as a result, an award is deficient under the first prong of <span class="Italic">BEP. </span>In particular, the Authority has decided, consistent with the framework established 20 years ago in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, United States Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990), that a provision is enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b) unless it abrogates a <span id="page_2014"></span>disputed management right. As the majority notes, the first prong of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>is not in dispute in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It may well be that the term "reconstruction" was inartful in conveying the concept it embodies. However, whatever term is used, the Authority has made clear that the purpose of the second prong is to "ensure that an agency's section 7106(a) rights are limited only to the extent the parties bargained for." <span class="Italic">SSA, Boston Region (Region 1), Lowell Dist. Office, Lowell, Mass.</span>, 57 FLRA 264, 270 (2001) (Member Wasserman dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Boston</span>). Inquiring whether an award is based on an enforceable contractual provision is not enough; it is also necessary to inquire whether a remedy for violating that provision is properly based on that provision. Unless the term "nothing" in &#x00A7; 7106(a) means "nothing except arbitral remedies"--an interpretation that the plain wording does not permit--the latter inquiry is compelled by the Statute.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The majority's premise that an arbitrator's exercise of remedial authority effectuates the Statute's mandate that "nothing" shall preclude negotiation over subjects set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b), Majority Op. at 8, does not hold water. <span class="Italic">IRS </span>is crystal clear that "nothing" includes the entire Statute, including its grievance and arbitration provisions. 494 U.S. at 928.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that an arbitrator's remedy may no longer be found deficient based on management rights, the majority draws a sharp line between a remedy and the remainder of an award. This line does not exist in the wording of the Statute or the extensive precedent interpreting it. Moreover, it is entirely artificial. In this regard, few parties (not to mention grievants) would find it meaningful. Indeed, management rights disputes in arbitration nearly always involve what the awards require agencies <span class="Italic">to do (or stop doing)</span>: the remedy.[6] In addition, that the majority would (continue to) find remedies deficient on the other grounds set forth in &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute is of no moment because, consistent with <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, &#x00A7; 7106(a) provides an independent limitation on an arbitrator's remedial authority, and this limitation cannot be ignored.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;To illustrate this point, I note but a few examples of the twenty four awards found deficient under the second prong of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. In <span class="Italic">United States Department of Defense, Defense Contract Management Agency</span>, 59 FLRA 396 (2003) (then-Member Pope dissenting in part on other grounds) the arbitrator found that the agency failed to properly administer its incentive awards committee and, as a remedy, directed the agency to replace its performance appraisal system. In <span class="Italic">United States Department of Defense, Departments of the Army and the Air Force, Alabama National Guard, Northport, Alabama</span>, 55 FLRA 37 (1998), the arbitrator found that two grievants had not been properly considered for one vacancy and, as a remedy, ordered both grievants promoted.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In this regard, the majority puts great stock in the policy that arbitrators have broad authority to fashion remedies. I do, too. However, there are other policies in play, including the policy decisions underlying the Congressional decision to enact &#x00A7; 7106(a). Despite my reluctance to overturn arbitral awards, I believe that scrutiny of remedies under &#x00A7; 7106(a) is required by the Statute and, if such scrutiny is to be eliminated, it must be done through legislative change. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Hopkins</span>, 427 U.S. 123, 125 (1976) (Court noted effect of application of statutory wording and stated that "'it is up to Congress to remedy this apparent harsh result[.]'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Keetz v. United States</span>, 168 Ct. Cl. 205, 207 (1964)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority states that an award must "be reasonably related to the negotiated provisions at issue and the harm being remedied." I agree that this is a legally permissible formulation of what I believe is a connection required by the Statute between a remedy disputed under &#x00A7; 7106(a) and the relevant contract provision. That is, I find that a "reasonable relation" standard, properly applied, is consistent with the Statute. Further, I would find that the remedy in this case is reasonably related to the contract provision and the harm remedied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the "reasonable relation" standard here, I agree with the majority that the award is not deficient. Regrettably, however, I part company with the majority on the reasoning used to reach this conclusion. Put simply, the majority is unwilling to adopt or apply "reasonable relation" as a standard for assessing whether a remedy is deficient based on management rights. Instead, only exceptions to remedies based on the "private sector grounds" set forth in &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2) of the Statute may be granted.[8] As the Statute requires <span class="Italic">some </span>standard and the majority is unwilling to apply <span class="Italic">any</span>, I am unable to bridge the gap.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The majority's statement that its revised approach "deviates not at all...from the approach that [it is] discarding" undoubtedly creates confusion that will promote litigation to clarify the matter. In fact, it is quite clear that the revised approach discards the second prong of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>and, as such, deviates completely from the prior approach. Moreover, although the majority disputes my claim that, under the revised approach, remedies will be found deficient based on private sector grounds only, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, the majority states repeatedly that a remedy will not be found deficient based on management rights alone. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 2 (revised approach "gives arbitrators the same scope of remedial authority in...management rights cases as they...exercise in rendering awards that do not affect management rights"); 8 (under revised approach "[i]t is sufficient that an...award that affects management rights...provides a remedy for a violation of...an applicable law...or a contract provision...negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute"); 9 (awards alleged to violate management rights must withstand the same challenges "[a]s in other types of arbitration cases").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, I concur that the award is not deficient.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;I note that the Authority has addressed awards of CSAs in several previous cases. In <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 61 FLRA 735 (2006) (<span class="Italic">FDIC I</span>) and <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 61 FLRA 738 (2006) (<span class="Italic">FDIC II</span>), the Authority sustained Agency exceptions based on the second prong of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>to awards of CSAs and modified the awards to require the Agency to consider the grievants for CSAs. The Agency did not raise management rights in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 62 FLRA 356 (2008) (<span class="Italic">FDIC III</span>)<span class="Italic">, </span>where the Authority denied the Agency's essence and exceeded-authority exceptions. In addition, the Union did not dispute the Agency's management rights claim in <span class="Italic">FDIC I, FDIC II</span>, or here. In <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 64 FLRA 79, 81 (2009) (Chairman Pope dissenting) (<span class="Italic">FDIC IV</span>), where the Union did dispute the Agency's management rights exception, the Authority denied that exception. However, the majority (over my dissent) remanded the award in <span class="Italic">FDIC IV </span>on essence grounds, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 82, a conclusion it now disavows. Majority Op. at 11 n.8. My understanding of the effect of today's decision is that <span class="Italic">FDIC I </span>and <span class="Italic">FDIC II </span>will no longer be followed with regard to management rights and the (majority) decision in <span class="Italic">FDIC IV </span>will no longer be followed with regard to essence.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FDIC</span> was summarized by <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA, Office of Disability, Region IV</span>, 67 FLRA 164, 165 (2014) (denying recon. in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA, ODAR</span>, 67 FLRA 12 (2012)) (Member Pizzella concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In <span class="Italic">FDIC, Division of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Protection, S.F. Region</span>, the Authority's lead decision on this point, the Authority concluded that the restriction on arbitrators' remedial authority imposed by the reconstruction requirement was not warranted by the Statute's language, structure, or policies. Rather, the Authority reaffirmed the deference due arbitrators' wide-ranging remedial authority under the Statute, so long as an arbitrator's award is reasonably related to the negotiated provisions at issue and the harm being remedied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, where an arbitrator finds that an agency's performance appraisal violated a collective-bargaining agreement, Authority precedent does not require an arbitrator to award any particular remedy. And the Authority addressed this issue in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> by stating that "when law does not require a particular remedy, an arbitrator is not required to remedy a violation of a collective-bargaining agreement." Thus, we no longer apply the reconstruction precedent that the Union relies upon, and the Union's argument does not provide a basis for reconsidering <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>.</p>
