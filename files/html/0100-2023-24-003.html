<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Final Decision</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7703(a)(1) speaks of judicial review of a final decision or order of the Board, and the Federal Circuit's case law confirms its interest in avoiding piecemeal review of less than final decisions. An MSPB remand order would not ordinarily be a final order subject to review in the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Adams v. OPM,</span> 144 Fed. Appx. 872, 874 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing a "final order or decision" of the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1); 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). An order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further proceedings and findings is not final. <span class="Italic">Cabot Corp. v. United States</span>, 788 F.2d 1539, 1542 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Caesar v. West</span>, 195 F.3d 1373, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("Remands to administrative agencies, because they mark a continuation of the case, are not generally considered final decisions for jurisdictional purposes."). The rule permitting appeals only from final decisions of administrative agencies avoids judicial interference with ongoing administrative proceedings and "saves the expense and delays of repeated appeals in the same suit." <span class="Italic">Travelstead v. Derwinski</span>, 978 F.2d 1244, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Because the Board remanded to OPM for further proceedings, the Board's decision is not final. We therefore dismiss Mr. Adams's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. If the Board issues an adverse final decision after OPM issues the reconsideration decision ordered by the Board, Mr. Adams may seek review of that decision at that time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Board order remanding a case to an agency was not final and appealable to the Federal Circuit. Because the remand could have resulted in a decision to hire the appellant and award him lost wages and benefits, his appeal (to the Board or to the court) at the time of the remand was premature. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20091897587af3d131011897">587 F.3d 1310</a>, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Cabot Corp. v. United States</span>, 788 F.2d 1539, 1542 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and <span class="Italic">Patterson v. OPM</span>, 111 Fed. Appx. 590 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP). <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 876 F.3d 1106, 1109-11 (Fed. Cir. 2017), also determined to be nonfinal and nonreviewable a Board decision remanding for further consideration remedial components of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our jurisdiction over petitions for review of orders of the Merit Systems Protection Board appeals derives from 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). That statute provides that this court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal "from a final order or final decision" of the Board. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A) ("[A] petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit."). Our jurisdiction over a petition therefore turns on whether the determination that the petitioner seeks to appeal "constitutes a 'final order or final decision' for purposes of section 1295(a)(9)." <span class="Italic">Weed v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 571 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting <span class="Italic">Haines v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 44 F.3d 998, 1000 (Fed. Cir. 1995)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5158"></span>The statutory requirement that we limit our review to "final" orders and decisions of the Board parallels the familiar "final judgment rule" in appellate proceedings, which is aimed at curbing "piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions which do not terminate the litigation." <span class="Italic">United States v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has remanded the case for further proceedings, we look to whether the agency has required further administrative adjudication; we do not base our decision on whether the agency has formally denominated its action as a "remand."

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Morrison argues that the Board's order was final because the Board denominated its decision as its "final order."

Rather, the Board stated that, to ascertain the appropriate relief, "the agency [must] first determine if and when [Mr. Morrison] would have been removed had he not retired." The Board then outlined various potential outcomes, depending on how the Navy ultimately decided that question. Because it is not the case that the Board's decision left "nothing for the [agency] to do but execute judgment," the Board's ruling was not a final order or decision, and we lack jurisdiction over the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Cabot</span>, 788 F.2d at 1543 (an order seeking "additional findings, determination, and redetermination" from the agency is not final for purposes of appellate review); <span class="Italic">see also Gingery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Morrison argues that the Board merely sent this case back to the Navy to implement and comply with the Board's decision, not to conduct any further proceedings. We disagree. As the Board's opinion makes clear, the Board required the Navy to decide, in the first instance, whether and when Mr. Morrison would have been terminated if he had not retired. That was the critical modification that the Board made to the initial decision, in which the administrative judge had ruled that Mr. Morrison "would have been separated effective July 13, 2012." The Board directed that such a determination had to be made by the agency.[3] As such, the Board's decision was not final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), and we therefore dismiss the petition without reaching the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Mr. Morrison suggests that on remand the agency was virtually certain to decide that he would have been removed as of July 13, 2012, and that subsequent events have proved that to be true. But our jurisdiction cannot turn on a party's estimate of the probability of losing on remand. And the fact that there has been a decision by the agency on remand, which has been appealed to the Board, is a further indication that it is not this appeal, but the subsequent one, which includes the full record of the remand proceedings, that is the proper vehicle for determining whether Mr. Morrison is entitled to back pay for any or all of the period between July 13, 2012, and his mandatory retirement date in June 2014.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Esparraguera argues that because the Order Referring Record was the <span class="Italic">last</span> action from the Board related to her removal, it was "final." But "final" does not merely mean "last in time."</p>

Ms. Esparraguera makes no argument that this is such an order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Order Referring Record was not "final" with respect to Ms. Esparraguera's removal. As discussed, the Board was not empowered under &#x00A7; 3592 to review Ms. Esparraguera's removal, and the proceeding bore none of the adversarial hallmarks of adjudication. Rather, the Board simply acted as a ministerial record-developing adjunct to the Under Secretary, enabling Ms. Esparraguera to enter her arguments and evidence into the record for the Under Secretary's ultimate consideration. <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Morrison v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 876 F.3d 1106, 1109-11 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (deeming order not "final" where the Board simply forwarded a case to another decisionmaker for further proceedings). The Order therefore did not dispose of the "case" of her removal; that case was never before the Board.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Ms. Esparraguera also argues that she was "adversely affected or aggrieved" by the Order Referring Record because it did not "grant relief from her removal." But the Board had no power to review her removal in any capacity. A party cannot be "adversely affected or aggrieved" within the meaning of the statute by the Board's failure to grant relief that it had no authority to grant. The government also suggests that Ms. Esparraguera forfeited her arguments by not affirmatively asking the Board official during her hearing to rule on the merits or correct a due process violation--in other words, that she cannot be "adversely affected or aggrieved" by the order because she did not expressly ask for the relief she now seeks. Our futility doctrine complicates forfeiture, <span class="Italic">see Arthrex, Inc. v. Smith &#x0026; Nephew, Inc</span>., 941 F.3d 1320, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2019), but we need not reach that question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Esparraguera argues that the presumption in favor of judicial review mandates that she have a forum for her constitutional challenge. And she argues that, under <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, judicial review must occur in the Federal Circuit in cases involving CSRA-related removals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded that <span class="Italic">Elgin</span> requires (or even empowers) <span class="Italic">this court</span> to review the due process question under these circumstances. To be sure, <span class="Italic">Elgin</span> held that we, as opposed to district courts, have jurisdiction over constitutional issues associated with certain challenges to adverse actions under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 567 U.S. at 11-12, 18-19, 21. But that holding was premised on the petitioners in that case being "covered employees challenging a covered adverse employment action" under the CSRA--which meant that the Board could review the challenged action, and that this court could review the Board's decision and the accompanying constitutional issues. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21. In other words, under <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, the CSRA <span id="Page_5160"></span>channels judicial review of an adverse action exclusively through the Federal Circuit only if it first channels review through the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, here the Board had no jurisdiction over the removal and we have no "final order" to review. <span class="Italic">Cf. id</span>. at 18 (noting Federal Circuit's authority to decide constitutionality "in an appeal from agency action within the MSPB's jurisdiction"). And as we have discussed, our jurisdiction is limited by statute: we cannot decide a case simply because a claim arises under the Constitution. So even assuming that Ms. Esparraguera is correct that she must be able to present her constitutional claim before a court, we are unpersuaded that this means <span class="Italic">our</span> court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At any rate, we also doubt that our lack of jurisdiction leaves Ms. Esparraguera's constitutional claims unreviewable. We observe, as does the government, that district courts have indeed been willing even after <span class="Italic">Elgin</span> to hear constitutional challenges where Board review of an adverse employment action is unavailable. <span class="Italic">E.g., Coleman v. Napolitano</span>, 65 F. Supp.3d 99, 103-05 (D.D.C. 2014) (holding that a district court had jurisdiction to hear plaintiff's due process claim where Board review was unavailable under the CSRA); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Billington</span>, 51 F. Supp.3d 97, 106-09 (D.D.C. 2014) (same); <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Holder</span>, 82 F. Supp.3d 416, 422-24 (D.D.C. 2015) (same); <span class="Italic">accord Semper v. Gomez</span>, 747 F.3d 229, 241-42 (3d Cir. 2014) (concluding that a "federal employee who could not pursue meaningful relief through a remedial plan that includes some measure of meaningful judicial review" would not be precluded by the CSRA from bringing a district court constitutional challenge); <span class="Italic">see also Webster v. Doe</span>, 486 U.S. 592, 603-04 (1988) (holding that a constitutional claim was reviewable in district court even where the substance of the underlying termination decision was not). To be clear, our holding today does not depend on whether judicial review might be available elsewhere. That is not the question before us. The question today concerns only the scope of our narrow statutory grant of jurisdiction. And our jurisdiction has clearly been constrained by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we hold that, with respect to her removal, Ms. Esparraguera was not adversely affected or aggrieved by a "final order or final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board." <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1). We therefore lack jurisdiction over the due process question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Casillas v. VA</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP), suggested that a Board decision granting the appellant's request to withdraw an appeal would not be judicially reviewable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Casillas has not shown that he has been adversely affected by the Board's decision granting his own request to withdraw this appeal, such that he would be entitled to judicial review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1) (providing only that "[a]ny employee...<span class="Italic">adversely affected or aggrieved</span> by a final order or decision of the...Board may obtain judicial review" (emphasis added)).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As to the sufficiency of a decision from the Board, although articulation of the reasons for an administrative action may lead to greater deference by a court, the Board's action is not sustained if it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary to law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 USC 7703(c). <span class="Italic">Nagel v. DHHS</span>, 707 F.2d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (review of reasonableness of penalty). The decision should set forth reasons for its conclusion; "[w]e must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong." <span class="Italic">McKeague v.
