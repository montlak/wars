<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-58"><span class="space">4.</span> Substantial Limitation of Major Life Activity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant is not regarded as disabled, her proof must include that the claimed disability limits one or more major life activities. Once the limitation is established, the question becomes whether that limitation caused the employment-related situation leading to the appeal and whether the limitation could be reasonably accommodated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Substantially limits" was defined by <span class="Italic">Mallory v. USDA,</span> DC-0432-13-0347-I-2 n.6 (NP 6/8/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulations that implement the ADA, as amended by the ADAAA, provide that the term "'substantially limits' shall be construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the ADA. 'Substantially limits' is not meant to be a demanding standard." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(i). "An impairment is a disability within the meaning of this section if it substantially limits the ability of an individual to perform a major life activity as compared to most people in the general population. An impairment need not prevent, or significantly or severely restrict, the individual from performing a major life activity in order to be considered substantially limiting. Nonetheless, not every impairment will constitute a disability within the meaning of this section." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many of the decisions that follow precede the 2008 ADAAA, expanding the definition of disability beyond that in the ADA. Refer to EEOC guidance under the ADAAA, including its "Fact Sheet on the EEOC's Final Regulations Implementing the ADAAA," <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/fact-sheet-eeocs-final-regulations-implementing-adaaa">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/fact-sheet-eeocs-final-regulations-implementing-adaaa</a>; its "Questions and Answers on the Final Rule Implementing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008," <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/questions-and-answers-final-rule-implementing-ada-amendments-act-2080">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/questions-and-answers-final-rule-implementing-ada-amendments-act-2080</a>; and website guidance on disability discrimination, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc-disability-related-resources">https://www.eeoc.gov/disability-discrimination</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In order to be disabling, the limitation must be substantial. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 95 MSPR 134, 142-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-26 (2003), applied the test developed by the Supreme Court before the ADAAA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</span>, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681, 151 L. Ed.2d 615 (2002), the U.S. Supreme Court discussed the requirements for proving whether an individual is disabled, because he is substantially limited in the major life activity of performing manual tasks, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The Court first explained that the ADA requires covered entities to provide "reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 122 S. Ct. at 689. It noted that the ADA defines a "qualified individual with a disability" as "an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the, employment position that such individual holds or desires," and that a "disability" is either "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual," "a record of such impairment," or "being regarded as having such an impairment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court then stated that to qualify as being "disabled" under the ADA a person must prove that he has a physical or mental impairment, and that the impairment substantially limits a major life activity<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, 122 S. Ct. at 690. It further explained that the word "substantial" in the phrase "substantial limitation" means "considerable" or "to a large degree," and precludes impairments that interfere with major life activities in only a minor way. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 122 S. Ct. at 691. It also stated that a major life activity means an important life activity, such as "those activities that are of central importance to daily life," and that all of these terms must be strictly interpreted to create a demanding standard for qualifying as "disabled" under the ADA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court further held that submitting a medical diagnosis of an impairment is not sufficient, by itself, to prove disability, and that such proof requires offering evidence that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial, in terms of the employee's own experience. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 122 S. Ct. at 691-92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While <span class="Italic">Toyota</span> does not directly govern this case because the Court specifically limited itself to consideration of the proper standard for answering whether an individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of performing manual tasks, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, 122 S. Ct. at 689, and the present case does not appear to concern that major life activity, we find that it provides appropriate guidance for determining whether the appellant has established that he is disabled. In addressing the major life activity of performing manual tasks, the Court defined broader terms that apply to all claims under the ADA, such as "major life activities," and "substantial" limitation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 122 S. Ct. at 691-92. Further, its determination that these terms be strictly interpreted to create "a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, 122 S. Ct. at 691, also warrants application of the <span class="Italic">Toyota</span> definitions to claims arising under major life activities other than performing manual tasks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this guidance to the present case yields the conclusion that the appellant has not proven that he is "disabled." Dr. Joly's report establishes that the appellant has back and knee impairments. It does not indicate, however, how these impairments "substantially limit," as the Court has defined that term, the appellant's ability to care for himself, perform manual tasks, walk, see, hear, speak, learn and work. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)<span class="Italic">; Justice,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 23. Further, the appellant offered no evidence regarding his own experience living with these conditions, upon which we could conclude that his impairments substantially limit a major life activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant has not established that he is "disabled" because the agency perceived him as disabled. There is no evidence that the agency had any misperceptions about the appellant's impairments, or that it ever believed that the appellant's impairments substantially limited a major life activity. Instead, the record shows that the agency knew that the appellant had knee problems before he suffered his compensable injury, that it provided him with accommodations for that problem at the Frederick Douglass Home before that injury, and that the Anacostia Park position was easier for the appellant to navigate with his knee problems because it was not as hilly as the Frederick Douglass Home site. Further, the appellant's supervisor testified that he believed that the appellant was physically capable of performing the duties of his position, and we have found above that the duties of the two positions <span id="Page_3427"></span>are equivalent. Thus, there is no basis for concluding that the agency believed that the appellant was unable to perform his duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the ability to work is a major life activity, the limitation on the ability to work has been analyzed by the Board only if no other major life activity is limited by the appellant's disability, and the analysis then will focus on the connection between the disability and the ability to perform assigned work, <span class="Italic">Roseman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 76 MSPR 334, 341-44 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant must rely on indirect evidence to establish his disability discrimination claim, i.e., where, as here, the agency alleges that its action was taken for a reason unrelated to the alleged disability, the legal analysis will follow the burden-shifting framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Co. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 255-57, 101 S.

Once the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 559-60. If the employer satisfies this burden of production, then the appellant must introduce evidence to show that the proffered explanation is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 559-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A disabled person is one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of the person's major life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. Dept. of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force</span>, 74 MSPR 648, 659 (1997); <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 477 (1990). The term "major life activity" includes, but is not limited to, sitting, standing, lifting, and reaching. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appendix to 29 CFR Part 1630, discussing 29 CFR 1630.2(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in determining whether the appellant was "disabled" under the regulations, the administrative judge stated that he "must consider whether the specified impairment identified in this appeal constitutes a significant barrier to employment." He proceeded to discuss the appellant's medical evidence only to determine whether it showed that the appellant was unable to perform his job as a Revenue Officer with the agency, i.e., whether the appellant was impaired with regard to the major life activity of work. He concluded that no such impairment existed. In light of the medical evidence presented and the appellant's argument below, we find that the administrative judge's failure to analyze whether the appellant was substantially limited in any other major life activity as a result of his physical or mental impairments constitutes error.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We note that, since the initial decision was issued in this case, the Board has stated that in determining whether an appellant is substantially limited in a major life activity, the major life activity of working should be examined last, and only in the event that the individual is not substantially limited with respect to any other major life activity<span class="Italic">. Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 559. If an individual is substantially limited in any other major life activity, no determination need be made regarding whether the appellant is substantially limited in working. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Scalese v.

West</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940051 (Mar. 31, 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence clearly supports the appellant's contention that he was "disabled" by his back condition at the time of each of the adverse actions at issue. A July 8, 1993 OWCP form, filled out by the appellant's Orthopedist, Dr. Sidney C. Walker, indicates that the appellant was restricted to 2 hours of sitting, 3-4 hours of walking, and 1-2 hours of standing per day. In follow-up letters, dated May 5, 1994, November 3, 1994, and April 14, 1995, Dr. Walker stated that the restrictions were still in effect. In a May 1, 1995 letter, Dr. Wilmer C. Allen, another Orthopedist who treated the appellant, stated that the appellant "cannot engage in prolonged sitting or standing." Further, the appellant testified that he was unable to sit, stand or walk for extended periods of time. The agency did not rebut any of the appellant's medical evidence. Accordingly, we find that the appellant was substantially limited in his ability to sit and stand, which by definition are major life activities, and was therefore disabled at all times relevant to this action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Appendix to 29 CFR Part 1630, discussing 29 CFR 1630.2(i).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The appellant has not established, however, that he was disabled at any time as a result of his mental condition. Although he submitted a letter from a psychiatrist that indicated that he suffered from Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Pain Disorder, he has not shown that any of those conditions substantially impaired a major life activity. Even assuming that the appellant was disabled by these conditions, he has not shown that they caused his misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Ajanaku v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 44 MSPR 350, 353-55 (1990); <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 128, 132-34 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 182 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find, however, that the appellant has not established that he was the victim of disability discrimination in connection with the adverse actions that are at issue here, as he has not shown a sufficient causal connection between his disability and the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Honeyman v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 136, 141 (1990); <span class="Italic">Ajanaku</span>, 44 MSPR at 353-55; <span class="Italic">cf. Brinkley v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 684 (1988) (an appellant alleging alcohol or drug abuse must show that any disability caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of his disability). Both of the sustained charges in the two actions involve a failure to follow directions, and a number of the specifications are substantially similar in nature. In summary, after being directed to do so, the appellant failed to access the IDRS computer system, failed to make either a minimum number of, or certain specified field calls, and failed to spend a minimum percentage of his time on "direct time" activities. In his petition for review, the appellant does not specify how his back condition caused the misconduct with which he was charged. A number of assertions he made below, however, can be construed as arguments in favor of such a connection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the appellant stated that he did not access the IDRS system because he had trouble using it as a result of his long injury-related absence from duty, and because he required further training. The evidence, however, indicates that the appellant received training on the system when he returned to duty in 1993, and he admitted on cross-examination that he could have accessed the system if he had chosen to do so. Second, the appellant argued that he was unable to make field calls as directed because he could not drive safely as a result of side effects of some of the medications he was taking. The record reflects, however, that the appellant did make field calls on at least 10 occasions after his return to duty in 1993, that he eventually made the 4 field calls specified in one of the directives that he is charged with failing to follow, and that he drove at least part of the way on a trip from his home to Florida during the time in question. Thus, the appellant has not shown that his disability left him unable to drive to the extent that he could not have followed the field call directives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in support of a connection between his failure to work the requisite direct time and his back condition, the appellant argued that he could not work the required amount of direct time because he was forced to spend his time on EEO complaints, a pending grievance, and an unfair labor practice complaint, each of which involved his back condition in some way. While the record supports the appellant's explanation that most of the administrative activities in which he was engaged instead of working direct time were <span class="Italic">related to</span> his back condition, we find that such a relationship is not equivalent to a showing that his disability <span class="Italic">caused</span> his misconduct. Where, as here, the appellant is charged with failure to follow directions and asserts the defense of disability discrimination, he must demonstrate that his disability <span class="Italic">prevented</span> him from at least attempting to comply with the instructions given. Here, in each instance, the appellant chose not to follow the directions of his supervisor, and he has not shown that his back condition gave him a reasonable motive for making such a choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 374, 379 (1989) (an appellant with rheumatoid arthritis failed to establish that his refusal to follow instructions was caused by his condition).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Abrams,</span> CB-7521-08-0001-T-1 (NP 5/9/2011), decided under the ADAAA, applied <span class="Italic">Roseman</span> and explained the necessity for connecting the employee's disability with charged work errors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent also asserts that the administrative law judge erred by failing to state or apply the proper standards for analyzing his disability discrimination defense. He contends that the evidence shows that he is disabled, citing testimony that because of diabetes and a leg fracture that would not heal, he was confined to a wheelchair. He contends that he requested a reasonable accommodation and argues that the administrative law judge erred in finding that the agency's alleged failure to accommodate him did not affect his ability to comply with the directives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) defines "disability" to mean, among other things, "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual," and defines "major life activity" to include walking. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1) and (2). Thus, the respondent meets the definition of a disabled person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish his disability discrimination claim, however, the respondent must show not only that he is a disabled person, but that the action appealed was based on his disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 16 (2010). The respondent has not established that he was the victim of disability discrimination in connection with the adverse actions at issue here because he has not shown a sufficient causal connection between his disability and the charged misconduct. Although he asserts that his disability and the agency's alleged failure to accommodate it prevented him from complying with the chief administrative law judge's directives, the first three directives also stated that he could explain his inability to comply with respect to the specific cases listed. He has not explained how his disability, even if it prevented him from transporting files, prevented him from explaining his inability to comply with respect to the specific <span id="Page_3428"></span>cases. Thus, he has shown no error in the administrative law judge's ultimate determination that he failed to prove this affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roseman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 334, 343-44 (1997) (the appellant did not show how his back condition caused his failure to follow directions because he did not show that his disability prevented him from at least attempting to comply with the instructions given); <span class="Italic">Sublette v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 82, 88-89 (1995) (the appellant did not establish that the misconduct for which he was removed was due to his purported disability and thus he was not entitled to a reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 486, 488-93 (1998), decided before the ADAAA, provides an example of analysis of a disability claim tied to an asserted limitation on a major life activity creating the basis for, or causing, the adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant, effective November 25, 1995, from her GS-5 Editorial Assistant (OA) position based on a charge of being unable to perform the duties of her position because of medical restrictions. The agency asserted that the permanent medical restrictions at issue--inability to remain in a sitting position with head/neck in a fixed position for greater than 15 minutes at a time, and restricted repetitive use of the right arm--prevented her from performing several duties necessary to meet the minimum requirements of her position description.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her...appeal...the appellant asserted, among other things, that the agency "[d]id not take precautions to make my working area safer to enable me to perform," and that she "deserved to get transferred to a position, or placed back to [her] former Secretary (Steno) GS-318-5 [position], which [she] had no problems to fulfill and perform for nine (9) years." The appellant claimed that the agency "at no time made preventions, after my job injury, to make the environment safer to alleviate my pain," and "fail[ed] to accommodate limited duties."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision based on the written record, the administrative judge sustained the agency's charge, found that the appellant did not prove her affirmative defense of disability discrimination because she did not articulate a reasonable accommodation under which she would be able to perform the essential functions of an established position, and found that the penalty of removal was within the limits of reasonableness and promoted the efficiency of the service. The administrative judge, therefore, affirmed the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In setting forth the appropriate analytical framework for cases, such as the instant appeal, that involve direct evidence of disability discrimination, the Board distinguishes between those cases in which the appellant alleges that she can perform the essential functions of the position without reasonable accommodation, and those in which the appellant concedes that she can perform the essential functions of the position but only with reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 552, 560 (1997). Where, as here, the appellant seeks some form of accommodation, she may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination by showing that she is a disabled person, that the action appealed was based on her disability, and, to the extent possible, by articulating a reasonable accommodation under which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who raises a claim of disability discrimination may establish that she is disabled by showing that she is substantially limited in a major life activity, that she has a record of such a limitation, or that she is regarded as having such a limitation. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 558. The term "major life activity" means "functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning or working." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 74 MSPR at 558-59. Here, the appellant clearly suffers from a physical disability, cervical spondylosis, that causes her to be unable to perform a portion of her duties without accommodation, and the agency removed her because of this physical disability. Specifically, the appellant suffers from a physical impairment which substantially limits her in the major life activities of sitting and performing certain manual tasks. There is no question that this disability caused her removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 93 MSPR 494, 502 &#x00B6; 19 (2003) (upholding an arbitrator's conclusion that the appellant, who suffered cervical spondylosis, had not proved she was substantially limited in any major life activity; disability determinations are made on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee asserts that a disability precludes the performance of manual tasks, the impairment must prevent or severely restrict the individual from performing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives. Further, the impairment's impact must also be permanent or long-term. An individualized assessment of the effect of the impairment is imperative when the impairment is one whose symptoms vary widely from person to person. The assessment of the impairment applies regardless of whether the individual has any connection to the workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor v. Williams</span>, 122 S. Ct. 681, 691-93 (2002) (analysis before ADAAA).</p>
