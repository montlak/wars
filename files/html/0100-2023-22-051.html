<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-52"><span class="space">1.</span> Lack of Reasonable Inquiry</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Stout v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 359, 361-62, 3 MSPB 440 (1980), counsel fees were awarded because removal was improperly based on investigation reports indicating office inefficiency but not directly attributing the difficulties to the appellant; the agency deciding official should have known that the removal of the appellant would not be sustained. The standard for "lack of reasonable inquiry" requires the appellant to show that the agency would have, by making a reasonable inquiry, ascertained at the outset of the action that the case was without merit but nonetheless persisted. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 25 MSPR 251, 253 (1984) (employee advised the agency during the reply that he was not striking and that he had not been advised of the cancelation of his leave, a circumstance the agency could have readily verified and should have known); <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 23 MSPR 396, 400-01 (1984) (appellant was awarded fees when he was charged with engaging in a labor strike but told agency officials of coercion; fees were also justified under the substantial innocence standard); <span class="Italic">Betz v. DHUD</span>, 12 MSPR 107, 110-11 (1982) (fees were justified, although the "knew or should have known" standard was not specifically cited, because the agency's error in administering a RIF was made known to it soon after the RIF notice by 25 employees who protested that the agency action violated their retention rights; had the agency reexamined its action, it might have realized at an early stage that the appellant was being improperly released from her competitive level).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were warranted because, if the agency reasonably inquired at the onset about the appellant's status, he could not have been removed; the fee entitlement was not defeated because the appellant failed to put the agency on notice at the reply stage of all the facts that it should have ascertained concerning his status. <span class="Italic">Tarrant v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 25 MSPR 129, 131 (1984) ("The Board finds...that it was not absolutely necessary for the appellant to have put the agency on notice at the oral reply of the facts in his case upon which he prevailed. Had the agency made a reasonable inquiry into the facts at hand at the outset, including its records and the information which the tower chief had...the tower chief and other agency officials should have ascertained that the action was without merit."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dunn v. VA</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("[A] negligently conducted investigation might give rise to fee entitlement under [<span class="Italic">Allen</span>] category five[.] "); <span class="Italic">Desrochers v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 141, 143 (1985) (fees awarded: "Having been presented with information tending to exonerate the appellant, the agency clearly had a duty to make further inquiries[.] ").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal involving alleged falsification of time records, the AJ found the agency evidence unreliable, not probative of the charges. The agency disregarded credible evidence that exonerated the appellant. Fees were awarded by the AJ because the action clearly without merit. The Board sustained the fee award, noting that the evidence collected by the agency supporting the adverse action was inconclusive and provided no basis for the action when considered with conflicting probative evidence from the appellant. Rather than determining the action clearly without merit, the Board stated that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. If the deciding official properly considered the appellant's response in light of the paucity of the agency's evidence, he should have known that the demotion of the appellant could not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Cicero v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 55, 57, 4 MSPB 145 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the evidence collected by the agency is conflicting and if the agency's investigation is reasonably diligent, then it cannot be said that the agency knew or should have known that its action would not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Jones v. DOD</span>, 42 MSPR 35, 40 (1989) (credibility dispute concerning an assault charge); <span class="Italic">Wise v. FAA</span>, 23 MSPR 666, 669 (1984) (knowledge of an appellant's circumstances, provided to congressional liaison officials in agency offices in Washington, was not imputed to an agency deciding official in the field--it was the appellant's duty to make the facts known to the decisionmaker); <span class="Italic">Batchelder v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 14 MSPR 37, 39 (1982) ("The issue before the agency was strictly one of credibility which would not necessarily have been resolved upon further investigation."). On review, in <span class="Italic">Wise v. MSPB</span>, 780 F.2d 997, 999 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court affirmed that fees may be required for an appellant whose agency negligently investigated its case, although the court denied fees because the agency reasonably believed it should remove the appellant based on the information available to the agency at the time:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board must "appraise the agency's decision to carry through the action against the employee. If the agency was <span class="Italic">negligent</span> in its conduct of the investigation then the agency 'knew or should have known' not to take the action." [citing <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>]. However, "[t]he fact that the presiding official [of the MSPB] later found that the charge was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence does not establish that it was negligently brought or was clearly without merit." <span class="Italic">Batchelder v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 12 MSPB 227, 228 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency has before it contradictory statements by witnesses as to misconduct and the appellant denies the conduct, although the appellant's statement may be self-serving, the agency should recognize that it cannot sustain its burden of a preponderance of evidence if the agency has no other evidence. Under the circumstances, the agency knew or should have known that it could not sustain its case, and counsel fees are appropriate. <span class="Italic">Piper v. DOJ</span>, 3 MSPR 571, 573, 4 MSPB 90 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Steger v. Defense Investigative Serv.</span>, 717 F.2d 1402, 1404 (D.C. Cir. 1983), an employee was discharged for using a government car in a private business, making false reports concerning his duties, and taking unauthorized absence from his investigative work. During the reply stage, the employee presented evidence from 11 witnesses who cast doubt on the credibility of the witnesses on whom the recommending official relied. The appellant was discharged, but MSPB reversed. It believed the appellant's witnesses. Appellant moved for an award of counsel fees, claiming that if the agency more carefully scrutinized the evidence he offered, the agency would or should have known that it could not prevail on the charges. The Board denied the fee request because the employee only alluded to, but not introduced into the record of the oral reply, exonerating statements that, once introduced into evidence before the Board, won the case. <span class="Italic">Steger v. Defense Investigative Serv.</span>, 10 MSPR 43, 44-45 (1982). The court remanded the appeal for reconsideration, in light of other decisions resolving that an employee was entitled to fees as a result of the failure of the agency to develop evidence offered during the reply stage that exculpated the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board enjoys considerable discretion in deciding when an award of attorney's fees "is warranted in the interest of justice." The MSPB's discretion is not, however, absolute. The applicable standard of judicial review requires this court to set aside the Board's attorneys' fees decisions that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7703(c)(1) (Supp. V 1981). Although the nature of our review is admittedly narrow, we must...satisfy ourselves that the Board, in reaching its decision, has considered the "relevant factors."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court went on to review the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors, 717 F.2d at 1405:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e reject at the outset the suggestion by DIS that the Board may only award attorneys' fees if a claimant proves "bad faith or some comparable motive prompting the agency action."...&#8197;Such a position is wholly at odds with the well-supported conclusion reached by the Board in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> that the "warranted in the interest of justice" standard, as enacted in the final version of the Act, was "intended to be broader than that provided [in an earlier Senate bill] which would have limited awards to cases involving agency bad faith."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court then turned its attention to the two factors deemed relevant to the fee determination: the contentions that the action was clearly without merit and that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it sought to terminate him. The court provided a basis for distinguishing the two factors, 717 F.2d at 1405:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin the analysis by noting that the factors deemed relevant by the Board involve two relatively distinct situations. First, there is the situation where an agency's adverse action against an employee is virtually groundless. In making this determination, the Board examines "the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency's action." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>...&#8197;Generally speaking, this inquiry is categorized under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor 2 (agency action that is "clearly without merit," "wholly unfounded," or taken against an employee who is "substantially innocent" of the charges), although it may also be appropriate in part to factor 5 (where an agency knows "that it would not prevail on the merits"). Second, there is the state of affairs identified in the remaining part of factor 5, where an agency takes action against an employee even though it "<span class="Italic">should have known</span> that it would not prevail on the merits."...&#8197;The relevant determination here focuses in large measure on an agency's failure to investigate exonerating facts brought to its attention by the affected employee....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court concluded that the Board's refusal to impose a duty upon the agency to inquire about exonerating facts presented during an oral reply to be contrary to the Board's cases awarding fees to appellants who would have been exonerated had the agency inquired into exonerating facts presented during the reply process, 717 F.2d at 1406-07:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board not only fails to distinguish its precedent, but wholly fails to even consider it, the agency's arbitrariness is compounded....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since its seminal opinion in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Board has determined that attorneys' fees may be warranted when an agency blindly continues with adverse personnel action despite the presentation of exonerating facts by the employee--facts which, had the agency only inquired into them, would have spared the employee the considerable expense of hiring an attorney. In the present case, the Board's unexplained failure to apply an agency's duty of prudent inquiry to the DIS forces us to reverse the Board's decision as arbitrary and capricious and remand to the Board for further consideration of whether, in light of this relevant factor, a fee award is due Steger and, if so, in what amount.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A dissent in <span class="Italic">Steger</span> argued that the Board was not arbitrary in faulting Steger for not providing copies of the witness statements, rather than oral summaries of them, during the reply process. The dissent expressed concern that the <span id="Page_4583"></span>Board was expected to provide too much analysis of fee issues, 717 F.2d at 1407, 1409:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I dissent because I believe the majority has applied a microscope to an inquiry which Congress meant to be conducted with the naked eye....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...For agencies, no less than for courts, it is unnecessary to provide the same high degree, not merely of consistency, but of <span class="Italic">explicit justification</span> for all determinations. For highly discretionary judgments such as the present one it suffices, I think, that there are in fact valid grounds relied upon by the agency for treating the case differently from earlier cases. To require that the agency not merely allude to those grounds (which it <span class="Italic">did</span> here) but also identify them as the specific reason for departing from arguably applicable precedent, is to impose intricacies of process reserved for more important and less discretionary determinations. In holding otherwise, the court continues the progressive complication of agency process and encourages the progressive trivialization of the business of appellate courts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, <span class="Italic">Steger v. Defense Investigative Serv</span>., 19 MSPR 462, 464-65 (1984), noted that the appellant offered exonerating statements during the reply and the agency did not further examine the facts. Fees were awarded contingent on the submission of additional detail from counsel. The agency should have known that it would not prevail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another appeal, the principal agency witnesses were incredible on charges of threats of bodily harm lodged against the appellants. Numerous credible witnesses for the appellants were ignored by the proposing official during his investigation, and this investigation was relied on by the deciding official. Management had reason to be more circumspect than usual because the appellants provided testimony to the Federal Labor Relations Authority concerning unfair labor practices shortly before the investigations into the charges leading to their removals. The agency lacked a reasonable basis for the removal action, entitling the appellants to counsel fees. <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 14 MSPR 523, 526-27 (1983). If an employee was free from fault as to a charge that she failed to pay the government rent for housing and her supervisors shared her view that she was not obliged to pay rent, the agency should have known it would not prevail. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 401, 403-04 (1982). Fees were awarded when removal resulted from unreasonable actions of the supervisor that would have been discovered had the agency undertaken a reasonable inquiry. <span class="Italic">Hockman v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 22 MSPR 570, 572-73 (1984) (also finding that the action against appellant was in bad faith, the culmination of tension and hostility caused in substantial part by the supervisor's behavior).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency should have known it would lose in a challenge to a removal of an employee the agency promoted into a typing position, knowing the employee had suffered an injury that precluded him from performing the duties of the position. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 424, 427 (1985). An award of fees was sustained against an agency that should have known it could not prove that the employee was released by his physician to return to work after surgery. The agency was informed of the appellant's condition by his physician. <span class="Italic">Forbis v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 24 MSPR 647, 650-51 (1984) (fees were also awarded on the alternative determination that the employee was substantially innocent of misconduct). A different result occurred, however, for an employee removed for physical inability to perform his work. The medical evidence from the appellant's physician was inconclusive, and the agency had other medical evidence suggesting that the appellant was unable to do his work. <span class="Italic">Truss v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 574, 578 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency will not be liable for fees only because, following inquiry, a recommendation was made within the agency that was not accepted by the deciding official, <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 341, 347 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reiterates his argument that the agency's pursuit of his removal, despite an internal agency review and recommendation that the charges did not support a removal penalty, demonstrated that it knew or should have known that it could not prevail on the merits....&#8197;It is clear from the record that the agency thoroughly reviewed, carefully considered and ultimately rejected the internal recommendation for specific reasons, a decision well within its management discretion. The agency was clearly not bound by the internal recommendation. In any case, as pointed out by the agency, the presiding official reached the same conclusion as the internal recommendation, but did so on the basis of a different rationale which could not necessarily have been foreseen. We find this case distinguishable from such cases as <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 2 MSPB 604 (1980), and <span class="Italic">Koenig v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 12 MSPB 103 (1982). In <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, we found an attorney fee award proper when an agency, as a result of its recklessness and ill will, unjustifiably failed to inquire into the facts, at the outset of its removal action, when such an inquiry would have revealed that its action was wholly unfounded. In <span class="Italic">Koenig</span>, we found such an award warranted because the agency should have known, in light of the Board's reversal of the agency's first denial of the appellant's within-grade increase, which it did not contest, that it could not prevail on the merits of a second such denial. In the appeal now before the Board, we cannot conclude that the presiding official erred in finding that the appellant failed to prove his contention that the agency should have known it could not prevail on the merits of its case.</p>
