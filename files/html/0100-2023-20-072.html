<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-69"><span class="space">b.</span> Proceeding to Compel OSC Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although OSC has been the subject of criticism by those who find it ineffective, the courts are disinclined to establish a remedy for its inaction. Federal district courts do not wish to manage federal personnel matters, directly or indirectly. The statute vests discretion in OSC as to the extent of any investigation. Under prior law, OSC was not required to give lengthy and detailed reasons for its termination of an investigation. 5 USC 1214(a)(2)(A)(ii) now requires OSC, upon termination of its investigation, to provide to the complainant "a summary of relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, including the facts that support, and the facts that do not support, the allegations of such person." Although finding that the MSPB had no review authority over the extent of OSC investigations, a court suggested that an action in the way of mandamus may lie in the district court when OSC fails to conduct any inquiry into a complaint. <span class="Italic">Wren v. MSPB</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 875 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1982) ("It is also quite clear from the statutory language and corresponding legislative history that Congress did not mean to make the OSC's decision to terminate or conduct an investigation or bring a proceeding before the Board reviewable on the merits."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Blue v. Widnall</span>, 162 F.3d 541, 545 (9th Cir. 1998) (unless OSC was made a party to an action in district court, the court has no basis to determine whether OSC performed an adequate inquiry into the complaint filed with it by the plaintiff); <span class="Italic">Borrell v. Int'l Communications Agency</span>, 682 F.2d 981, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1982) ("Judicial review of the OSC's decision not to investigate or to prosecute is limited, at most, to insuring compliance with the statutory requirements of an inquiry into employee allegations to the extent necessary to determine if the allegations are meritorious and of a brief statement of reasons for terminating an investigation," citing <span class="Italic">Wren</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>); <span class="Italic">cf. Taylor v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-1221-17-0088-W-1 (NP 8/12/2022) ("On review, the appellant also argues that OSC improperly closed its investigation into her OSC complaint without completing a proper investigation. However, the alleged inadequacy of OSC's investigation has no bearing on our jurisdictional analysis. <span class="Italic">Salerno</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 15.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One court decided that as long as OSC conducts an investigation, a court may not review the substance of that investigation to compel a better one. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DeLeonardis v. Weiseman</span>, 986 F.2d 725, 727 (5th Cir. 1993). <span class="Italic">Barnhart v. Devine</span>, 771 F.2d 1515, 1526 (D.C. Cir. 1985), discussed, a lawsuit seeking review of a job classification, the possibility of a mandamus petition in court if the Special Counsel were improperly to fail to investigate a case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n aggrieved employee may, as we have seen, seek a writ of mandamus to compel the OSC to investigate a complaint and, in addition, may seek limited judicial review of the OSC's determination that the complaint does not merit the Board's consideration. In the latter instance, judicial review is limited to determining whether the Special Counsel's investigation of the complaint constituted an adequate discharge of the Office's responsibilities under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See Carducci, supra</span>, 714 F.2d at 175 (citing <span class="Italic">Cutts, supra</span>, 692 F.2d at 140). While limited, that review nonetheless enables the court to determine whether the Office of Special Counsel had adequate information upon which to base its determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weber v. United States</span>, 209 F.3d 756, 758-60 (D.C. Cir. 2000), arising out of an agency's revocation of the plaintiff's security clearance, cast doubt on the authority of a district court to review the adequacy or existence of an OSC investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appointing an <span class="Italic">amicus</span> to take appellant's position, we directed the parties to address <span class="Italic">inter alia</span> the district court's jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to the Office of Special Counsel, a question that had been left open in <span class="Italic">Barnhart v. Devine</span>, 771 F.2d 1515, 1524 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The government now argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction. It relies on <span class="Italic">Telecommunications Research and Action Ctr. v. FCC</span>, 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984) ("<span class="Italic">TRAC</span>"), for the proposition that when a Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review the actions of an agency, then the district courts lack power to issue writs of mandamus to that agency. In <span class="Italic">TRAC</span>, we explained that by "lodging review of agency action in the Court of Appeals, Congress manifest[s] an intent that the appellate court exercise sole jurisdiction over the class of claims covered by the statutory grant of review power." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 77. According to the government, allowing district courts to issue writs of mandamus to the OSC would interfere with the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction to review the decisions of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The difficulty with the government's position is that the Federal Circuit reviews the actions only of the MSPB and not of the OSC, which is a separate and independent agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1211. To be sure, an employee alleging a prohibited personnel practice must give the OSC a chance to investigate before going to the MSPB. But the MSPB does not review the OSC's decision of whether to investigate; it simply makes its own assessment of the validity of the complaint. When the Federal Circuit reviews the MSPB's action, it is not even indirectly reviewing the OSC, so allowing district courts to issue writs of mandamus to the OSC would not affect the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, if district courts lacked power to issue the writ, judicial review of OSC actions would not be available. TRAC had recognized that mandamus might be available when "a denial of review in the District Court will truly foreclose all judicial review." <span class="Italic">TRAC</span>, 750 F.2d at 78. (The government does not argue that the actions of the OSC should be entirely immune from judicial review.[1] ) Here, Weber claims that the OSC violated a statutory duty to investigate his allegations. This is a claim that he could not make before the MSPB or the Federal Circuit, so if the district court lacked jurisdiction, Weber would have no way to vindicate the statutory right he asserts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Such an argument would not be very plausible in light of <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S. Ct. 180, 3 L. Ed.2d 210 (1958). In <span class="Italic">Leedom</span>, the Supreme Court held that although NLRB orders in certification proceedings had been understood not to be final orders subject to judicial review, a district court had jurisdiction over a suit to "strike down" an order made in excess of the Board's authority, because a plaintiff otherwise would have no means of enforcing an express statutory mandate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the district court had jurisdiction over this action, and we therefore have jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the merits, the <span class="Italic">amicus</span> argues that even though the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> stripped the MSPB of authority to take action on behalf of an employee whose security clearance has been revoked, the OSC nevertheless has a duty to undertake an investigation of Weber's complaint. Such an investigation would not be futile it is argued because under the statute the OSC is not limited to prosecuting before the Board: if it determines that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, it must report its findings or recommendations to "the agency involved and to the Office of Personnel Management, and [it] may report such determination, findings, and recommendations to the President." 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(B). Still, we believe that this grant of authority to the OSC does not justify the issuance of a writ of mandamus, for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the OSC may act--whether by proceeding before the MSPB or by making a recommendation to the agency or the President--only with respect to a "prohibited personnel practice." As we have noted, a "prohibited personnel practice" is a "personnel action" taken for an impermissible reason. But "personnel action" is defined in terms of a list of actions such as appointment, promotion, and reassignment, that does not include the granting or denial of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2). It might be thought that a security clearance revocation could fall within the statute's catch-all provision, which at the time of Weber's dismissal referred to "any other significant change in duties or responsibilities that is inconsistent with the employee's salary or grade." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(x) (1993). But this reading is foreclosed by <span class="Italic">Egan.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not directly address the meaning of "personnel practice" in &#x00A7; 2302. It concluded that the revocation of a security clearance is not an "adverse action" that can be reviewed by the MSPB under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513. Yet it did not reach this conclusion by parsing the language of that statutory provision. Instead, it made the judgment that "the protection of classified information must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine who may have access to it. Certainly, it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment...." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529, 108 S. Ct. 818. In other words, the general presumption of reviewability of agency action does not apply to security clearance decisions. The <span class="Italic">Egan</span> rationale obviously applies here as well and therefore a "personnel practice," like "adverse action," does not include a decision about a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> suggests that the OSC did not rely on this interpretation of the statute in its letter to Weber and so we cannot base our opinion on it.[2] But the OSC's view of its authority is not relevant because mandamus is proper only when an agency has a clearly established duty to act, and here the OSC does not.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Indeed, in another case the OSC has explicitly rejected this reading, perhaps reflecting an understandable desire to interpret its enforcement authority broadly. <span class="Italic">See Roach v. Department of the Army</span>, 82 MSPR 464 (1999) (pending review in the Federal Circuit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This conclusion also disposes of Weber's constitutional claims. <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> contends that Weber has been deprived of liberty without due process because he has lost his job and has been "stigmatized." Since the OSC had no duty--and indeed no authority--to conduct an investigation, its failure to do so could not have deprived Weber of any legal right.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mandamus is inappropriate, moreover, for a second reason. <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> argues that the OSC has a duty to undertake an investigation, but because she concedes that it would be futile for the OSC to bring Weber's case before the MSPB, the purpose of its investigation would be limited to writing a letter to the Army, to the Office of Personnel Management, or to the President. The act of reporting recommendations, however, is highly discretionary and therefore far removed from the paradigm case for <span id="Page_3767"></span>mandamus--a ministerial act that an agency has a clear duty to perform. <span class="Italic">See Council of and for the Blind of Delaware County Valley, Inc. v. Regan</span>, 709 F.2d 1521, 1533 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). And there is no reason to believe that even a favorable OSC recommendation--which would not be binding on anyone--would actually help Weber. Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy whose issuance is guided by equitable principles. <span class="Italic">See 13th Regional Corp. v. United States Dep't of Interior</span>, 654 F.2d 758, 760 (D.C. Cir. 1980). It is not to be granted in order to command a gesture. We think it would be inappropriate to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the OSC to make what would amount to a purely hortatory statement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carson v. U.S. Office of Special Counsel</span>, 633 F.3d 487, 491-96 (6th Cir. 2011), concluded that a district court has jurisdiction to entertain a case against OSC only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate a complaint at all; but the district court has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider OSC's jurisdictional determinations or the adequacy of its investigations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A court of appeals "must determine its own jurisdiction and is bound to do so in every instance." <span class="Italic">Dickerson v. McClellan,</span> 37 F.3d 251, 252 (6th Cir. 1994). We have jurisdiction over this appeal if the district court had jurisdiction over this action. <span class="Italic">See Weber v. United States,</span> 209 F.3d 756, 759, 341 U.S. App. D.C. 128 (D.C. Cir. 2000). The district court effectively concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determined that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary duty to investigate Carson's allegations. We review a district court's findings as to whether it had subject matter jurisdiction <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Willis v. Sullivan,</span> 931 F.2d 390, 395 (6th Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mandamus jurisdiction in federal courts is codified at 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1361, which provides that "[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff." "The existence of jurisdiction under section 1361 is inextricably bound with the merits of whether a writ of mandamus should issue; in order to establish either jurisdiction or entitlement to the writ, a court must find that a duty is owed to the plaintiff." <span class="Italic">Maczko v. Joyce,</span> 814 F.2d 308, 310 (6th Cir. 1987). "[t]he remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations." <span class="Italic">Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc.,</span> 449 U.S. 33, 34, 101 S. Ct. 188, 66 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1980). Mandamus is available only if: "(1) the plaintiff has a clear right to relief; (2) the defendant has a clear duty to act; and (3) there is no other adequate remedy available to the plaintiff." <span class="Italic">In re Medicare Reimbursement Litig.,</span> 414 F.3d 7, 10, 367 U.S. App. D.C. 116 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Mandamus is not an appropriate remedy if the action that the petitioner seeks to compel is discretionary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Heckler v. Ringer,</span> 466 U.S. 602, 616, 104 S. Ct. 2013, 80 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have never decided whether a district court may issue a writ of mandamus against the Office of Special Counsel for failure to investigate a claim. <span class="Italic">See Ryon v. O'Neill,</span> 894 F.2d 199, 205 n.3 (6th Cir. 1990) (stating that whether mandamus is available to enforce the Office of Special Counsel's investigatory duty is an "open question" in the Sixth Circuit). However, the District of Columbia Circuit has concluded that a district court does have subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations. <span class="Italic">See Weber,</span> 209 F.3d at 759. The District of Columbia Circuit reasoned that because the Federal Circuit has authority to review only Merit Systems Protection Board decisions and not Office of Special Counsel decisions, "if district courts lacked power to issue the writ, judicial review of [Office of Special Counsel] actions would not be available." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly, the Fifth Circuit has held that federal courts have authority to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel complies with its statutory obligations. <span class="Italic">See DeLeonardis v. Weiseman,</span> 986 F.2d 725, 727 (5th Cir. 1993) ("[A]n employee's right to obtain judicial review of the [Office of Special Counsel's] decision not to pursue a complaint is limited to [the question of] whether the [Office of Special Counsel] discharged its duty to investigate the complaint.") (second alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <span class="Italic">accord Nowick v.

Apr. 30, 1999) (noting its authority to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel complied with its statutory obligations); <span class="Italic">Hyde v. Office of Special Counsel,</span> No. 94-1406, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 9372, 1995 WL 238340 (10th Cir. Apr. 21, 1995) (same). We find the reasoning of our sister circuits persuasive and thus hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, this holding does not imply that district courts have jurisdiction to review all Office of Special Counsel determinations. Various courts have held that district courts have no jurisdiction to review the Office of Special Counsel's decision to terminate an investigation or not to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board. <span class="Italic">See DeLeonardis,</span> 986 F.2d at 727 ("We agree with our colleagues of the D.C. Circuit that when the [Office of Special Counsel] decides to terminate an investigation that it began pursuant to a complaint, the decision is not reviewable."); <span class="Italic">Wren v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 681 F.2d 867, 876 n.9, 220 U.S. App. D.C. 352 (D.C. Cir. 1982) ("It is also quite clear from the statutory language and corresponding legislative history that Congress did not mean to make the [Office of Special Counsel's] decisions to terminate or conduct an investigation or bring a proceeding before the Board reviewable on the merits."). In addition, several unpublished opinions have followed this approach. <span class="Italic">See Hyde,</span> 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 9372, 1995 WL 238340 (holding that district courts have no authority to require the Office of Special Counsel to reconsider a complaint and resolve it a certain way); <span class="Italic">DeLeonardis v.

July 1, 1992) ("[A] district court may not review [Office of Special Counsel's] decision to terminate its investigation, or [Office of Special Counsel's] decision not to petition the [Merit Systems Protection Board].") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carson contends that this case is controlled by <span class="Italic">Weber,</span> 209 F.3d at 759. In <span class="Italic">Weber,</span> the plaintiff, a former Army employee, complained to the Office of Special Counsel that he had been stripped of a security clearance in retaliation for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 757. The Office of Special Counsel "declined to investigate" the plaintiff's complaint because it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate the complaint.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 758. The plaintiff then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Office of Special Counsel to investigate his accusation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, in both <span class="Italic">Weber</span> and the present case, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to investigate a complaint, and the plaintiff sought a writ of mandamus to compel it to investigate. In <span class="Italic">Weber,</span> the district court held that "there is no judicial review of the merits of the [Office of Special Counsel's] decision to dispense with an investigation." <span class="Italic">Weber v. Office of Special Counsel,</span> No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 1999). Then, the District of Columbia Circuit held that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel violated a non-discretionary statutory duty to investigate an employee's allegations. <span class="Italic">Weber,</span> 209 F.3d at 759. Because the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate because it believed that it lacked jurisdiction, the District of Columbia Circuit appears to have held that the Office of Special Counsel's determinations of its own jurisdiction are subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decline to rely on <span class="Italic">Weber</span> to hold that district courts have authority to review the jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel for a number of reasons. In this case the record indicates that the Office of Special Counsel conducted a preliminary investigation into Carson's claims. But it is unclear from the <span class="Italic">Weber</span> decision whether the Office of Special Counsel initiated any investigation at all into the plaintiff's claim in that case.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1] The District of Columbia Circuit opinion states that the Office of Special Counsel had "declined to investigate" the complaint. <span class="Italic">Weber,</span> 209 F.3d at 758. The district court's opinion initially states that the Office of Special Counsel "decided not to pursue the complaint." But it later states that the Office of Special Counsel "considered the plaintiff's complaint," and decided to "dispense with an investigation." <span class="Italic">Weber v. Office of Special Counsel,</span> No. 97-2260-LFO, slip op. at 2, 4, and 6. (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 1999). Thus, it is somewhat unclear whether the Office of Special Counsel declined to investigate the plaintiff's complaint at all or merely declined to continue its initial investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Weber</span> holds that district courts have authority to review the jurisdictional determinations of the Office of Special Counsel, we find the Fifth Circuit's reasoning to the contrary to be more persuasive. In<span class="Italic"> DeLeonardis,</span> 986 F.2d at 727, the plaintiff argued that "courts are allowed to look behind the agency's decision to terminate an investigation when...the agency applies the incorrect legal standard in deciding to terminate the investigation." The Fifth Circuit rejected this claim and stated that the plaintiff failed "to recognize, or at least to admit, that to allow him to succeed on this argument we would have to vitiate the clearly established rule that we do not look behind substantive [Office of Special Counsel] determinations to terminate investigations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Jurisdiction is a legal issue similar to the legal standard in dispute in <span class="Italic">DeLeonardis.</span> Thus, we hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to investigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Office of Special Counsel's jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its investigations. Now that we have established this main point, Carson's individual claims are easily resolved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court correctly concluded that it had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus regarding these three prohibited activity complaints. The Office of Special Counsel satisfies its statutory obligation when the Complaints Examining Unit conducts an initial investigation sufficient for it to determine whether a more thorough investigation is required. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wren,</span> 681 F.2d at 874 (discussing statutory <span id="Page_3768"></span>language governing prohibited personnel practice complaints). Here, the Office of Special Counsel conducted a preliminary investigation of Carson's allegations and concluded that further inquiry was unnecessary because he did not allege violations of civil service laws, rules, or regulations. Carson does not contend that the Office of Special Counsel failed to investigate his complaint; he contends that the investigation was inadequate. District courts may not review the Office of Special Counsel's substantive decision to discontinue an investigation for lack of cause. Thus, the district court could not order the Office of Special Counsel to conduct an additional investigation into Carson's claims after the Office of Special Counsel conducted preliminary investigations and decided to close them. Because the Office of Special Counsel discharged its statutory obligations by investigating these three complaints, Carson is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Section 1214(e) Reporting Requirement</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(e) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If, in connection with any investigation under this subchapter, the Special Counsel determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that any violation of any law, rule, or regulation has occurred other than one referred to in subsection (b) or (d), the Special Counsel shall report such violation to the head of the agency involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carson seeks a writ ordering the Office of Special Counsel to report the allegations that he raised in his complaints to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to section 1214(e). However, the district court correctly concluded that the Office of Special Counsel had no duty to report violations of law, rule, or regulation because the Office of Special Counsel never found that such violations had occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carson asks us to resolve his disagreement with the Office of Special Counsel about the meaning of the phrase "any law, rule, or regulation" in section 1214(e). Carson suggests that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel. The Office of Special Counsel, on the other hand, asserts that the phrase applies to violations of law, rule, or regulation that it discovers during an investigation but over which it lacks jurisdiction under section 1214 or 1216. However, it is unnecessary for us to resolve this dispute because the Office of Special Counsel never found reasonable cause to believe that any violations of law, rule, or regulation occurred. Therefore, we have no authority to issue a purely advisory opinion on this debate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., North Carolina v. Rice,</span> 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S. Ct. 402, 30 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1971) ("[F]ederal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them."). Thus, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;Carson's Motion to Amend</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carson does not contest the merits of the district court's decisions regarding complaints MA-08-1844 and MA-07-1668.[2] Rather, he claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend the petition in light of the Office of Special Counsel's decision regarding these two complaints. Carson moved to amend his petition to add allegations that, in closing these two complaints, the Office of Special Counsel failed to comply with the requirements set out in a statutory note following section 1214. The district court found that Carson's additional allegations would be futile because the Office of Special Counsel had already performed the non-discretionary duties it owed Carson. Because the district court based its decision to deny leave to amend on the legal conclusion that amendment would be futile, we review this decision <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Yuhasz v. Brush Wellman, Inc.,</span> 341 F.3d 559, 569 (6th Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The district court correctly dismissed Carson's claim that the Office of Special Counsel was required to provide him status reports regarding complaint MA-08-1844, a prohibited activity complaint, because the Office of Special Counsel is not required to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity complaints under section 1214. The district court correctly dismissed Carson's claim regarding MA-07-1668, a prohibited personnel practice complaint, because the Office of Special Counsel performed its duty to make a "reasonable basis" determination under section 1214 by explaining its basis for proposing to close his complaint, reviewing Carson's written comments to this proposal, and later terminating its investigation and closing the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Leave to amend must be freely given when justice so requires. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). Nevertheless, leave to amend "should be denied if the amendment is brought in bad faith, for dilatory purposes, results in undue delay or prejudice to the opposing party, or would be futile." <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Roane,</span> 53 F.3d 750, 753 (6th Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory note following section 1214 provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Special Counsel shall include in any letter terminating an investigation under section 1214(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code...the name and telephone number of an employee of the Special Counsel who is available to respond to reasonable questions from the person regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special Counsel, the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law applicable to the person's allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. 103-424 &#x00A7; 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367 (1994). Carson contends that the person whose name and number he was given did not respond to his "reasonable questions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For a writ of mandamus to be warranted, "there must be a mandatory or ministerial obligation. If the alleged duty is discretionary or directory, the duty is not owed." <span class="Italic">Maczko,</span> 814 F.2d at 310 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "A duty is not owed unless the obligation is plainly defined and peremptory." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although the Office of Special Counsel had a duty to comply with the statutory note following section 1214, the terms of that note are not readily ascertainable. "[w]hen a duty is disputed or subject to various interpretations,...the duty is not 'owed' in that the obligation to do a particular act cannot be said to be clear, peremptory, defined or ministerial within the meaning of section 1361." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> There is clearly discretion involved in responding "to reasonable questions from the person regarding the investigation or review conducted by the Special Counsel, the relevant facts ascertained by the Special Counsel, and the law applicable to the person's allegations." United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. 103-424 &#x00A7; 12(b), 108 Stat. 4361, 4367. Carson sought leave to amend his petition to request a writ of mandamus to enforce a statutory note that is subject to differing interpretations. This amendment would be futile because the district court would have no authority to issue the requested writ under section 1361.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we note that because MA-08-1844 is a prohibited activity complaint, the procedural requirements of section 1214 do not apply to it in any case. Section 1216, which governs prohibited activity complaints, provides that "[I]f the Special Counsel receives an allegation concerning [activities prohibited by any civil service law, rule, or regulation], the Special Counsel <span class="Italic">may</span> investigate and seek corrective action under section 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1216(c) (emphasis added). The plain text of the statute suggests that the Office of Special Counsel is not required to provide status reports regarding prohibited activity allegations, but rather has this discretionary power. <span class="Italic">See also Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel,</span> 522 F.3d 1373, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("[S]ubsection (c) of section 1216 specifies that [Office of Special Counsel] <span class="Italic">may</span> seek corrective action under section 1214...for activities described in [section 1216(a)(4)] in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved." (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added)). Thus, the district court correctly found that under section 1216, the Office of Special Counsel's decision whether to follow section 1214's procedural requirements was discretionary, and thus permitting Carson to amend his petition regarding a section 1216(a) investigation would be futile. Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of Carson's motion for leave to amend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that a district court has subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus only if it determines that the Office of Special Counsel has declined to investigate a complaint at all; it has no subject matter jurisdiction to consider the Office of Special Counsel's jurisdictional determinations or the merits of its investigations. The district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus regarding complaints MA-08-1842, MA-08-1843, and MA-08-2553 because the Office of Special Counsel had fulfilled its statutory duty to investigate these complaints. The district court had no subject matter jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to order the Office of Special Counsel to report allegations pursuant to section 1214(e) because the Office of Special Counsel never found that any violation of law, rule, or regulation occurred. Thus, we AFFIRM the district court's dismissal of Carson's claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that because the section 1214 statutory note regarding responding to "reasonable questions" is subject to differing interpretations, the district court correctly found that permitting Carson to amend his petition would be futile.
