<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-166"><span class="space">4.</span> High Three Salary Calculation: Basic Pay; Lump Sum Back Pay Settlement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The high-three formulation under CSRS was examined in <span class="Italic">DeLaet v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 390, 393-94 (1996) (also involving questions of foreign currency conversions and devaluation issues):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal Personnel Manual Supplement (FPM Supp.) 830-1 (Jan. 8, 1993), addresses the computation of annuities under the CSRS. Section 50A2.1-4 deals with "high three" average pay which is defined, at Subpart B, as the largest annual rate resulting from averaging an employee's rates of basic pay in effect over <span class="Italic">any period</span> of three consecutive years of creditable service, with each rate weighted by the length of time it was in effect (emphasis added). Subpart C specifically provides that the three-year period in which the average pay is computed starts and ends on the dates that produce the highest average pay, and that the period need not start on January 1, or the first day of any month, or the date of a pay change.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices (The Handbook) superseded FPM Supp. 831-1 on January 1, 1995. It provides information particularly relevant to foreign nationals, such as the appellant. Section 81A2.2-2, Subpart F does allow OPM to base the average pay of such individuals who are paid in local currency on salary deductions rather than base pay. Subpart (F)(5) further states that, where using the calendar-year deductions to derive the highest three consecutive years of service does not produce an employee's true "high three," the payroll office should determine if a period other than the calendar years would provide a larger benefit to the employee, and if so, annotate for OPM on the SF-2806 the amount of deductions for each year of three years during the period that represents the employee's highest three years of pay in United States dollars, recording the exact dates and corresponding annual deductions that represent the retiring employee's highest three consecutive years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the provisions of the FPM and the Handbook, as set forth above, the appellant's "high three" should have been computed using the time period that produced the highest average pay, even if it was not based on calendar years. We further conclude that the administrative judge erred in finding that, because the appellant failed to show that another period of time was required to be used, it was proper for OPM to use calendar years to compute the appellant's "high three." It is true that an applicant for benefits bears the burden of proof on the issue of his entitlement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 479 U.S. 1037 (1987). However, OPM is not free to disregard the provisions of the FPM and the Handbook, which constitute its own interpretation of statutes and regulations, and which are entitled to deference, particularly where, as here, OPM has statutory and regulatory responsibility over retirement matters.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The high-three equation was restated, <span class="Italic">Lepore v. OPM</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1474.Opinion.1-9-2019.pdf">759 Fed. Appx. 912</a>, 913 n.4, 915 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former federal employee's retirement annuity is based upon the employee's length of service and average salary, where a federal employee's average salary refers to the three highest paying years used to calculate the average pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 (outlining computation of annuity); <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 8331(4) (defining "average pay" as "the largest annual rate resulting from averaging an employee's...<span class="Italic">rates of basic pay in effect over any</span> [<span class="Italic">three</span>] <span class="Italic">consecutive years of creditable service</span>" (emphasis added)). "The three highest paying years" used to calculate average pay is also referred to as the "high-3." <span class="Italic">Killeen v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 382 F.3d 1316, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted.</p>

Cir. 2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM reasserts on review that it lawfully relied on the basic pay certified in the appellant's IRR for her last 3 years of service and that the appellant's former agency had lawfully excluded availability pay from her basic pay for her last 3 years of service because she did not receive availability pay during those 3 years. The appellant asserts that the administrative judge correctly determined that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f) required OPM to include availability pay in the full-time basic pay OPM was required to have deemed her to have earned in her last 3 years of part-time service. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with OPM's determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a FERS employee whose career included part-time service, the appellant's retirement annuity is calculated pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f), which provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)(1)&#x2003;In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee's actual service, as determined by prorating the employee's total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the annuity calculation is a two step process; the first step is to determine the average pay of an employee as described under &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A), and the second step is to calculate the annuity by prorating the annuity to reflect the employee's part-time service as described under &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">See Nichol v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6; 15 (2008);<span class="Italic"> see also Killeen v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 558 F.3d 1318, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we find that availability pay is not automatically part of the "annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A). The availability pay statute provides that the purpose of availability pay "is to provide premium pay to criminal investigators to ensure the availability of criminal investigators for unscheduled duty in excess of a 40 hour week based on the needs of the employing agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(b). Thus, availability pay is a form of "premium pay" for services performed in excess of a basic work week. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(a)(3)(A), (b); <span class="Italic">see Martinez v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 262, 264 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 126 F.3d 1480 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Further, in order to be eligible for availability pay, the statute requires an annual certification to the head of the agency by the employee and a supervising officer that the employee has and will satisfy the availability pay eligibility requirements set forth under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(d). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(1). The appellant admits that she was not eligible to receive availability pay during her last 3 years of part-time service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations and the precedent of both the Board and our reviewing court provide that certain types of income, including availability pay, shall only be included in basic pay in accordance with a statutory provision authorizing its inclusion. <span class="Italic">See Lisanti v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 573 F.3d 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Martinez,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 264; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.186(b). Congress limited the circumstances under which availability pay is to be included in "basic pay" for the purposes of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and FERS retirement statutes to when availability pay was actually "received by a criminal investigator under section 5545a of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(4), &#x00A7; 8331(3)(E)(i). Thus, "basic pay" only includes availability pay that was actually "received" by a criminal investigator in a given year. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Additionally, we note that our reviewing court has previously addressed and rejected, albeit in a different context, the assertion that availability pay is automatically a part of a criminal investigator's annual rate of basic pay. The court stated as follows in rejecting that claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The argument rests on a fallacious assumption: that law enforcement officers automatically are entitled to availability pay. The latter pay is not automatic, however, but requires compliance with the requirements of section 5545a, which include certification by both the law enforcement officer and his superior that the officer has met the statutory requirements.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Excluding Availability Pay From the Appellant&#x22A0;s Average Pay Does Not Contravene Congressional Intent in Enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the administrative judge's finding that OPM's failure to include availability pay as part of the appellant's average pay was contrary to Congressional intent in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f). Prior to 1986, an employee's average pay for retirement purposes was based on the pay the employee actually received during any 3 consecutive years the employee received their highest rates of basic pay. <span class="Italic">See Killeen v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 382 F.3d 1316, 1321-22 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Nichol,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6; 11. That method of average pay calculation provided a windfall to employees who worked part-time until their last 3 years, then switched to full-time service and, thus, had their annuities calculated as if they had worked full-time for their entire career. It also worked to the disadvantage of those employees who worked full-time for most of their service, but then switched to part-time service during the last 3 or more years of service when their basic pay would presumably have been the highest if they had worked full-time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1986, Congress addressed the unfairness when it added 5 USC &#x00A7; 8339(p) to the CSRS statute and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f) to the FERS statute. <span class="Italic">See Killeen,</span> 382 F.3d at 1322; <span class="Italic">Nichol,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. By adding those respective paragraphs, all employees' salaries are now calculated as if they worked full-time for the 3 years used to determine the employee's average pay, but that average pay is then prorated to reflect the employee's years of part-time service, regardless of when their part-time service occurred. <span class="Italic">See Killeen,</span> 382 F.3d at 1322; <span class="Italic">Nichol,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. OPM complied with this procedure in computing the appellant's annuity by actually using the full-time annual rate of basic pay for the appellant's position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because OPM calculated the appellant's annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1), her circumstances differ from the two Congressional concerns noted above. If Congress had been concerned about when a criminal investigator earned availability pay, it would not have required an annual eligibility certification to receive availability pay and it would not have limited the inclusion of availability pay in basic pay to that availability pay actually "received" by a criminal investigator. Although the appellant may consider the timing of her part-time service to have created an inequity in the determination of her average pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A), neither OPM nor the Board may ignore that the statutory definition of "basic pay" only includes availability pay "received." OPM, the Board, and our reviewing court may not include availability pay that is not authorized by statute. <span class="Italic">See Lisanti,</span> 573 F.3d at 1342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">OPM Properly Determined What Pay Should Lawfully Be Included in the Appellant's Certified Basic Pay</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we disagree with the administrative judge's finding that OPM failed to conduct an independent legal review of what pay should lawfully be included in the appellant's "basic pay" in determining her average pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A), as required by our reviewing court.[4] <span class="Italic">See Lisanti,</span> 573 F.3d at 1340. OPM did not simply use the basic pay certified in the IRR in determining the appellant's average pay, it used the "basic pay" defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A), and, further, it provided a legal analysis for its exclusion of availability pay from the appellant's basic pay and, thus, her average pay. OPM therefore complied with its obligations under <span class="Italic">Lisanti.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Lisanti,</span> the court modified prior Board decisions holding or implying that OPM and the Board are bound by the employing agency's IRR and that an appellant's remedy for a claim that the IRR is erroneous lies with seeking an amended IRR from the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Lee v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 7 (2008); <span class="Italic">Rainone v.

The court specifically rejected OPM's reliance on these decisions, finding that the IRR is not necessarily binding, and that, absent a clear Congressional intent to the contrary, both OPM and the Board are required to "entertain" a challenge to the employing agency's interpretation of the term "basic pay" on the IRR.<span class="Italic"> Lisanti,</span> 573 F.3d at 1239-40.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Denney v. OPM</span>, 706 F.3d 1360, 1361-1365 (Fed. Cir. 2013), confirmed that, unless it is received during the period of the high-three federal service, availability pay is not part of basic pay for retirement calculations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Denney served as a criminal investigator or special FBI agent from 1983 until her retirement in 2008. From 1983 until early 2001, Ms. Denney was eligible for and received "availability pay" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a. Availability pay is a form of premium pay equal to "25 percent of the rate of basic pay for the position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(b), (h)(1). To be eligible for availability pay, a criminal investigator must work at least forty hours per week (full-time) and actually work or be available to work an additional two hours per regular workday. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(d). Further, both the investigator and her supervisor must annually certify that "the investigator has met, and is expected to meet," these additional work requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 5545(e)(1). Beginning February 25, 2001, Ms. Denney began working part-time and was no longer eligible for, and no longer received, availability pay. Although Ms. Denney worked full-time from May 20, 2001 to August 26, 2001, she was not eligible for and did not receive availability pay at any time after February 25, 2001. Ms. Denney retired on December 31, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basic method for calculating an annuity for an employee with some full-time service and some part-time service like Ms. Denney is a two-step process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee's actual service, as determined by prorating the employee's total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1) (2006). The first step (subpart A) is to calculate "average pay"--using the "annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position"--of the employee for any period of three consecutive years of service that produces the highest average ("high three" years). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8415(f)(1), 8331(4). "Basic pay" in the context of a retirement annuity calculation includes various forms of additional pay that certain employees may receive. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> &#x00A7; 8331(3). These forms of additional pay are over and above the base pay for the position and include overtime pay, special expense allowances, physicians comparability allowances, premium pay, hazard pay, and "availability pay...received <span id="Page_4391"></span>by a criminal investigator under section 5545a of this title."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(3), 8331(3)(E)(i). The second step of the annuity calculation (subpart B) is to prorate the calculated average pay in accordance with the employee's ratio of full-time to part-time service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, OPM determined that Ms. Denney's last three years of service, 2006-2008, were her "high three" years because those were the three consecutive years of creditable service during which she earned the most using annualized full-time basic pay rates. In calculating average pay over the high three years, OPM did not include availability pay because Ms. Denney was not eligible for and did not receive availability pay during that period of time. For the second step, OPM calculated the ratio of Ms. Denney's time spent in full-time service to time spent in part-time service at 85%. Ms. Denney does not challenge OPM's "high three" determination or its full-time to part-time ratio calculation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Denney appealed OPM's average pay calculation and the administrative judge reversed, concluding that OPM erred by not including availability pay during Ms. Denney's high three years of service. OPM appealed to the Board, which sustained OPM's annuity calculation. Ms. Denney's appeal to this court presents a single question: whether or not her "average pay" calculation should include availability pay. We have jurisdiction under 28U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Denney argues that every full-time special agent is required to work ten-hour days and is automatically entitled to availability pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a. Ms. Denney argues that because the average pay calculation under &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A) is based on full-time service, her average pay calculation should have included availability pay because she would have been entitled to it during her high three years of service had she worked full-time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. Ms. Denney's argument hinges on the notion that availability pay is automatically part of basic pay. The relevant statutory language as well as the facts of this case, however, demonstrate that the forms of additional pay enumerated in &#x00A7; 8331(3), including availability pay, are not "automatically" part of basic pay for retirement annuity purposes. Rather, the plain meaning of the relevant statutes demonstrates that the forms of additional pay enumerated in &#x00A7; 8331(3) are part of basic pay for retirement annuity purposes only when an employee was eligible for and received such additional pay during the employee's high three years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8415(f) defines the two-step annuity calculation process for "an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis." It provides that "average pay...shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(f)(1)(A). It does not follow that availability pay, or any other form of additional pay defined in &#x00A7; 8331(3), should be included in the calculation of average pay in cases in which the employee was not eligible for and did not receive such pay during the pertinent period of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that &#x00A7; 8415(f)'s reference to "annual rate of basic pay" does not automatically include the various forms of additional pay enumerated in &#x00A7; 8331(3) because those forms of additional pay relate to different employment positions and conditions. It is also clear that the forms of additional pay enumerated in &#x00A7; 8331(3) do not naturally flow from the respective employment position alone because they also include eligibility requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, &#x00A7; 8813(3)(D) includes, as part of basic pay, "with respect to a law enforcement officer, premium pay under section 5545(c)(2) of this title." Section 5545(c)(2) provides premium pay of 10-25% above the "rate of basic pay for the position" on an annual basis for an employee whose position "requires substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty." Quite clearly, this premium pay does not naturally flow from the law enforcement position by itself but rather is available in addition to the "rate of basic pay for the position" only to those law enforcement officers who work substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled overtime. Similarly, &#x00A7; 8331(3)(G) discusses additional pay for customs officers. The referenced eligibility statute (the Act of February 13, 1911, as amended and codified at 19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 267) provides overtime compensation for certain customs officers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subject to [certain limitations], a customs officer who is officially assigned to perform work in excess of 40 hours in the administrative workweek of the officer or in excess of 8 hours a day shall be compensated for that work at an hourly rate of pay that is equal to 2 times the hourly rate of the basic pay of the officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 267(a)(1). This form of additional pay likewise does not naturally flow from the position of customs officer but instead is available to customs officers only for the overtime hours they are actually required to work. These examples illustrate that the additional pay items enumerated in &#x00A7; 8331(3) are over and above &#x00A7; 8514(f)(1)(A)'s "annual rate of basic rate...for full-time service in the position" and are considered retirement annuity "basic pay" for employees who were eligible for and received the additional pay. Such additional pay is not, however, automatic because it does not naturally flow from an employment position alone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The form of additional pay at issue in this case, availability pay, is addressed in &#x00A7; 8331(3)(E)(i). That section states that availability pay "received by a criminal investigator under section 5545a" is considered basic pay for retirement annuity purposes. The "received by" language in this particular section expressly confirms that availability pay, like the forms of additional pay previously discussed, is not automatic. Rather, for availability pay to be included in Ms. Denney's retirement annuity calculation, she must have "received" it. This is entirely logical given that, to be eligible for such pay, Ms. Denney had to meet the requirements of &#x00A7; 5545a, which specifies (1) working a full-time forty-hour week, (2) working or being available to work unscheduled duty for an average of two additional duty hours per workday, and (3) certifying and obtaining a supervisor's certification of such availability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For a large part of her service, Ms. Denney met the requirements of &#x00A7; 5545a and, therefore, was eligible for and received availability pay. However, for the three consecutive-year period of employment during which Ms. Denney's annual pay was the highest, 2006-2008, she was not eligible for and did not receive availability pay. During this period of time, Ms. Denney was not required to work a forty-hour week and was not required to certify and obtain supervisory certification of her availability to work an additional two hours per day of unscheduled service. Because availability pay was not "received by Ms. Denney] under section 5545a" during these "high three" years, OPM appropriately excluded availability pay from her annuity calculation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additional facts present in this case confirm that availability pay for Ms. Denney was not automatic. For approximately three months in 2001, Ms. Denney returned to a full-time work schedule but was not eligible for and did not receive availability pay. This fact demonstrates that availability pay was not automatically part of Ms. Denney's basic pay. This conclusion is entirely consistent with our prior opinions that have addressed availability pay in different employment contexts. <span class="Italic">See Caven v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 392 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("[A]vailability pay...is not automatic, however, but requires compliance with section 5545a, which includes certification by both the law enforcement officer and his superior that the officer has met the statutory requirements."); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 126 F.3d 1480, 1482 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("Since availability pay is premium pay, it is not part of the 'rate of basic pay' for a criminal investigator.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unfortunate that Ms. Denney's high three years of service occurred when she was not eligible for and did not receive availability pay. But the language of the relevant statutory provisions and facts of this case persuade us that availability pay is not automatic and should not be included in the calculation of retirement annuity "average pay" when the employee was not eligible for and did not receive availability pay during her high three years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Denney contends that excluding availability pay from her annuity calculation is inequitable because it penalizes her for working part-time during her high three years of service. Ms. Denney argues that she "is not asking for 'bonus' or 'overtime' pay to be added; she is asking that the regulations requiring the addition of premium pay be followed to achieve equal pay for equal service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find Ms. Denney's argument lacks merit. She is not being penalized for working part-time during her high three years of service. In determining Ms. Denney's high three years, OPM included availability pay during the period of time that Ms. Denney received it. OPM found, however, that Ms. Denney's "high three" years occurred during a period of time when she was not eligible for and did not receive availability pay. In other words, Ms. Denney's full-time pay during her high three years, 2006-2008, was greater <span class="Italic">without availability pay</span> than any of her previous years of service <span class="Italic">with availability pay</span>. Therefore, including availability pay during her high three years, when she was not required to meet the eligibility requirements for receiving availability pay, would result in an anomaly because Ms. Denney's rate of "average pay" for annuity purposes would be based on an adjusted salary level greater than she received at any point during her employment. The statutory language does not support calculating her average salary during her "high three" years based on pay for which she was not eligible and which she did not receive. That result would not achieve "equal pay for equal service" as Ms. Denney contends, and there is no evidence that Congress intended that result.</p>

Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5301(b), pay rates are fixed in accordance with the pay cap established by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5308. We find, therefore, that OPM correctly calculated the appellant's average salary on the basis of his capped salary, his basic pay. <span class="Italic">Cf. Reed v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 290, 292-93 (1987) (a retirement annuity is calculated on the basis of the average basic pay received during a specified period of the annuitant's creditable service), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 837 F.2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422(a) requires an employing agency to make deductions from each employee's basic pay in accordance with a fixed formula. As the administrative judge found, the appellant has not contended or shown that deductions were taken from the portion of his salary above the "cap" established pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5308.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A lump sum settlement representing an agreed upon amount of back pay is not credited to the retirement fund for purposes of annuity calculation, <span class="Italic">Reed v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 290, 291-93 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed in the position of Operations Supervisor, GS-11, step 7, with the Social Security Administration. She filed three formal complaints of discrimination, and a civil action in U.S. district court against the agency, alleging race and sex discrimination. These matters were informally resolved in a settlement agreement signed by the appellant on June 12, 1985. The settlement agreement provided, in relevant part, that the appellant would be paid the difference between what "would have been paid to her had she been promoted from a GS-11/7 Operations Supervisor position to a GS-12/3 position" effective retroactively eighteen months from the date she signed the agreement. The settlement agreement also provided that the appellant would retire from federal service "effective the date the [agency's] Director of EEO...signs the subject agreement. The agency's Director of EEO signed the settlement agreement on July 2, 1985, and the agency effected the appellant's retirement on that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the appellant received the lump-sum back pay award. When OPM computed the retirement annuity she was entitled to, however, it did not include in its annuity calculation of her average pay the lump-sum back pay award she received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely petition for appeal of OPM's reconsideration decision concerning the calculation of her annuity with the Board's San Francisco Regional Office. After affording the parties a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>: (1) That OPM properly calculated the appellant's annuity on the basis of the average basic pay she received for the GS-11 position she occupied, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(3), (4) and 8339(a); (2) that since the terms of the settlement agreement did not provide for the appellant's retroactive promotion to the GS-12 grade level and the agency did not effect her promotion to such position, OPM correctly based its calculation of her retirement annuity on her GS-11 salary; and (3) that, since the statutory definition of the average basic pay for calculation of a retirement annuity does not include all wages the employee received while employed, OPM correctly excluded the lump-sum back pay award when it calculated her retirement annuity. Therefore, the administrative judge affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and the Board agrees, that under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 83, Subchapter III (Civil Service Retirement), an annuitant's retirement annuity is calculated on the basis of the average basic pay received during a specified period of the annuitant's creditable service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(4) and 8339(a). "Basic pay," as defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(3), "does not include bonuses, allowances, overtime pay, military pay, [or] <span class="Italic">pay given in addition to the base pay of the position as fixed by law or regulation</span>...." (Emphasis supplied). Thus, under OPM's official guidance, "the rate of annual basic pay--not the pay actually received by the employee--is to be used" to calculate the retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual Supp. 831-1, Subch. S14-3(d)(1) (Sept. 21, 1981). Because OPM is the agency charged with the administration of the civil service retirement statutes, we accord deference to its reasonable interpretation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(3), (4) and 8339(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hollowell v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 30 MSPR 465, 469 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Comptroller General's decision to which the appellant refers concluded, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that informal settlements of discrimination complaints without a specific finding of discrimination are authorized by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and that federal agencies may authorize back pay awards, attorney fees, or costs without a corresponding personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Comp. Gen. 239, 244 (1983). The Comptroller General's decision concerns an agency's authority to award back pay in informal settlement of discrimination complaints without also awarding a retroactive promotion. The decision, however, does not address the issue of whether such a back pay award without a corresponding retroactive promotion is includable in an employee's average basic pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331 for purposes of calculating his retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The terms of the settlement agreement in the present case did not provide for the appellant's retroactive promotion to the GS-12 grade level and the agency did not effect such promotion. Therefore, the Board concurs with the determination of the administrative judge that OPM correctly based its calculation of the appellant's retirement annuity on the average basic pay of her GS-11 position, and that OPM correctly excluded the lump-sum back pay award in calculating her annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(3), (4) and 8339(a).</p>
