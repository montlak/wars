<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-68"><span class="space">m.</span> Removal for Physical Inability to Perform; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Bruner</span></span>; Settlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Angel v. OPM</span>, 122 MSPR 424, 431-32 &#x00B6; 14, 2015 MSPB 33 (2015), states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two methods exist for demonstrating eligibility for disability retirement benefits, either the employee can show that her medical condition: (1) affected her ability to perform specific work requirements, prevented her from being regular in attendance, or caused her to act inappropriately; or (2) is inconsistent with working in general, in a particular line of work, or in a particular type of work setting. <span class="Italic">Rucker</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 669, &#x00B6; 10. OPM argues that the appellant failed to establish her entitlement to disability retirement benefits because she applied for full-time positions and held several part-time positions after she filed her disability retirement application. However, the appellant was not required to show that her disability rendered her incapable of working all positions. The relevant position for determining the appellant's qualification for disability retirement benefits was the position she last held before filing her application. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a) (an employee is considered disabled if she is unable to render useful and efficient service in her position and she has not declined a reasonable offer of reassignment); <span class="Italic">see also Eshelman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 173, 176 (1996)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Duggar v. OPM</span>, CH-844E-16-0419-I-2, n.5 (NP 4/19/2022) ("We also are mindful that the appellant's ability to work in another position, if the position involves duties and responsibilities that are different than her previously held position, does not by itself exclude her from entitlement to disability retirement benefits. See 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a); <span class="Italic">Angel v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 14 (2015) (finding that the appellant's application for full-time positions and her employment in various part-time positions did not exclude her from eligibility for disability retirement benefits because she showed that her migraine headaches prevented her from performing the duties of her previously held Biological Science Laboratory Technician position); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because an employee's inability to perform his or her job may be for a temporary or permanent medical disability or reasons related to conduct, evidence of the employer's reasons for removing an employee may or may not be probative in a disability retirement appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bruner v. OPM</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 292-94 (Fed. Cir. 1993), determined that a rebuttable presumption of entitlement to a disability retirement arises if the employee is removed from the federal service for physical inability to perform the job, assuming the employee is otherwise qualified:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden in most disability compensation programs follows the general rules of evidence. As applied to disability retirement, the general rule is that the burden of proving entitlement is upon the person who asserts that he/she is disabled. <span class="Italic">Greenwich Collieries v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, United States Dep't of Labor,</span> 990 F.2d 730 (3d Cir. 1993). <span class="Italic">See Channel v. Heckler,</span> 747 F.2d 577, 579 (10th Cir. 1984) ("Once the [Social Security] claimant makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of disability...the burden of going forward shifts to the Secretary, who must show that claimant retains the capacity to perform an alternative work activity"). The placement of the burden of proof reflects social policy more than law, and tends to remain fixed despite procedural adjustments along the way. <span class="Italic">See generally Old Ben Coal Corp. v. Interior Board of Mine Operations Appeals, United States Department of Interior,</span> 523 F.2d 25, 36 (7th Cir. 1975) ("the incidence of the burden of proof is primarily a matter of policy based on experience"); 21 Charles A. Wright &#x0026; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence &#x00A7; 5122 (1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not aware of, and OPM has not pointed to, any statutory or regulatory allocation of the burdens of proof or of production with <span id="Page_4180"></span>respect to disability determinations made pursuant to the Civil Service Retirement Act. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b) states seven criteria that must be met for disability retirement, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No claim for disability retirement shall be allowed unless OPM determines that the claim should be granted based upon documentation provided by the applicant or the agency which demonstrates the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A deficiency in service with respect to performance, conduct or attendance, or in the absence of any actual service deficiency, a showing that the medical condition is incompatible with either useful service or retention in the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A medical condition which is defined as a disease or injury;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A relationship between the service deficiency and the medical condition such that the medical condition has caused the service deficiency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The duration of the medical condition, past and expected, and a showing that the condition, in all probability, will continue for at least a year;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The applicant became disabled while serving under the Civil Service Retirement System;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;The agency's inability to make reasonable accommodation to the employee's medical condition; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;The absence of another available position within the employing agency and commuting area, at the same grade or pay level and tenure, for which the employee is qualified for reassignment. For this part, placement in the agency is limited to those facilities in the commuting area that are serviced by the same appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Viewing these criteria, it is apparent that some involve evidence within the knowledge and control of the agency, and some within the purview of the employee. All are fact-dependent and subject to dispute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> this court held that the burden of proof, for purposes of eligibility for disability retirement, lies with the applicant, applying the general principle that an applicant for a benefit bears the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefit. The court in <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> did not discuss the allocation of the burden of production as to the seven criteria set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b), as distinguished from the burden of proof. The burden of production, also called the burden of going forward, is initially upon the person with the burden of proof, and generally requires the production of sufficient evidence to support a finding in favor of that person. <span class="Italic">E.g., Greenwich Collieries,</span> 990 F.2d at 735. The burden of production then shifts to the other party, who must, in turn, produce enough evidence to raise a question of material fact. <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</span> 450 U.S. 248, 255 &#x0026; n.8, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 1094 &#x0026; n.8, 67 L. Ed.2d 207 (1981). The Board in <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 M.S.P.B. 343, 6 M.S.P.R. 404 (1981), cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 776 F.2d at 278-79, setting the guidelines for disability appeals, assumed that the party with the relevant evidence will come forward to produce it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Since it is OPM's decision that we review in such cases, OPM of course remains obliged to come forward with evidence and an explanation demonstrating the basis on which it reached its determination. Indeed, as to some material issues OPM or the employing agency may be in a better position than the applicant to adduce at least some of the relevant evidence, e.g., total creditable service or availability of other positions of the same grade or class in which the applicant might perform useful and efficient service. We hold only that the ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant "in the sense of answering the question of who wins if all the evidence is inadequate or unconvincing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> 6 M.S.P.B. at 352-53, 6 M.S.P.R. at 416 (quoting 3 Kenneth Culp Davis, Administrative Law Treatise &#x00A7; 16.9 at 258 (2d ed. 1980)) (footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, this allocation of the burdens of production and persuasion does not take account of the agency's decision and action taken in cases such as this one, wherein the agency has already separated the claimant from service because of disability, the agency having found that the claimant was physically unable to do the assigned job and that there was no other position that the claimant was able to do. Such agency action is presumptively correct, and is not here subject to collateral attack. Thus the Veterans Administration's finding and action based thereon, that Mr. Bruner was physically unable to work and that there was no job within the agency that he was qualified for and physically able to do, produces an evidentiary presumption which serves to shift the burden of coming forward to the government. That is, the applicant is deemed to have met his burden of proof <span class="Italic">prima facie</span>. The burden of production then shifts to the government, to come forward with evidence sufficient to support a finding that the applicant is not disabled in terms of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed.R.Evid. 301. <span class="Italic">Cf. Meneses v. Secretary of Health, Education &#x0026; Welfare,</span> 442 F.2d 803, 806 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (when the Social Security claimant shows physical impairment disabling him from his former employment, the government has the burden of coming forward with evidence that there are jobs the claimant can do).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the applicant is not absolved of coming forward with evidence and argument in rebuttal of any evidence of absence of entitlement adduced by the agency, the agency must first meet its burden of producing sufficient evidence to support a finding that the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b) have not been met. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kerner v. Flemming,</span> 283 F.2d 916, 922 (2d Cir. 1960) ("[a]n applicant for a [Social Security] disability pension has the ultimate burden of persuasion.... However, it does not follow that the court is bound to sustain a denial of disability benefits where the applicant has raised a serious question and the evidence affords no sufficient basis for the Secretary's negative answer."). We do not hold that the ultimate burden of proof is shifted when the agency has separated the employee based on the agency's determination of disability, for we do not think that the presumption of disability based on agency action warrants this force. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed.R.Evid. 301 advisory committee's note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the government's action in separating an employee for disablement produces a presumption of disability that serves to shift to the government the burden of production. The government must come forward with enough evidence that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the applicant did not qualify under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b). Thus the initial presumption in favor of the claimant will control the result only in cases where the government does not introduce evidence sufficient to support a finding in its favor; in such cases, an applicant who has been dismissed for physical disqualification and absence of an alternative position will generally prevail. However, if the government's evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the applicant is not entitled to disability retirement in terms of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b), the totality of the evidence produced by both sides is weighed by the trier of fact, who may (but need not) infer disability from the facts giving rise to the presumption. Notes of Conference Committee, H.R. Rep. 1597, 93d. Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7098, 7099. The applicant, who retains the burden of persuasion, will then prevail only if he/she establishes entitlement by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that Mr. Bruner had not introduced sufficient evidence to prove that he was disabled, thus basing its findings on the weakness of his case. Consequently, the Board did not consider the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability that is presumed from the agency's removal action, and did not discuss whether the government's evidence was adequate to support a finding in its favor. This was a procedural error that, as we have discussed, went "to the heart of the administrative determination," <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 791, 105 S. Ct. at 1633, for it is possible that this error affected the result. <span class="Italic">See Speiser v. Randall,</span> 357 U.S. 513, 525, 78 S. Ct. 1332, 1341, 2 L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has applied the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption based on physical and/or psychological conditions when the employing agency removes the employee for physical inability to perform. <span class="Italic">See Dussault,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3 (stress, anxiety, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, emphysema, and diverticulosis); <span class="Italic">Kimble v.

Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 2 (2002) (depression, lupus, anemia, hypertension, and diabetes). Further, the Board has often noted and relied on the causal or exacerbating effect of one of an appellant's conditions on another, including both the psychological effect of a physical cause and the physical effects of a psychological cause, as well as on the aggravating effect on a mental condition of a failure at work that is attributable to the condition. <span class="Italic">Chappell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's removal for medical inability to perform the essential functions of her position constitutes <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that she is entitled to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 294 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Smedley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 10-13 (2008). The appellant argues in her petition for review that she is entitled to the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption because she was removed from her position. The appellant was removed for unacceptable performance. The Board has previously found that a charge of inability to perform job duties is distinct from a charge of unsatisfactory performance, and the charge of inability to perform job duties requires medical evidence showing that the employee <span id="Page_4181"></span>is incapacitated for particular job duties due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 21 (2002). The appellant's removal notice set forth the duties she failed to perform, but it did not include a determination by the agency that the appellant's medical condition caused her unacceptable performance. Based upon the charge and the evidence provided in the agency's removal notice, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant was not entitled to the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption based upon her removal for unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Hoyle v. OPM</span>, SF-844E-22-0288-I-1 (NP 4/27/2023) (AJ could consider <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> analysis when the employee had received a proposal, but not yet a final decision, of removal for medical inability to perform).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Shea v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 352, 355-56 (1994), emphasized the rebuttable nature of the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not every individual who has been removed from service because of a medical condition is "disabled" and entitled to disability retirement benefits. The <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> decision does not establish a <span class="Italic">non-rebuttable</span> presumption. OPM <span class="Italic">can</span> rightfully deny benefits if it can present proof that the appellant has insufficient objective medical evidence of disability under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b). In this case, based on the record before us, we conclude that the government has failed in establishing that the appellant had insufficient medical evidence of disability. Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant has established her entitlement to disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Klein v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 366, 372 (1996), explained how OPM rebuts a presumption of disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM can meet its burden of production to rebut a presumption of disability by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">See Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526-27; <span class="Italic">O'Shea v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 352, 355 (1994). In this context, proof of stress, anxiety, and discomfort at work is not enough by itself to establish disability; the evidence must also demonstrate that these factors are so severe as to prevent an employee from performing the specific duties of the position in question. <span class="Italic">See Clarke v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 30, 35-37 (1993), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 22 F.3d 1105 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Faragon v.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 42, 47, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 950 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). That evidence must also establish the degree to which the appellant's condition can or cannot be controlled. <span class="Italic">See Clarke</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 36-37; <span class="Italic">Faragon</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 70-71.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption was rebutted in <span class="Italic">Kibble v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 62, 66-67 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM can meet its burden of production to rebut a presumption of disability by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">See Trevan,</span> 69 F.3d at 526-27. The second letter submitted from Dr. Ahsan indicates that the appellant cannot work because she suffers from major depression. The submission from Dr. Patell also indicates that the appellant cannot work, in part, because she suffers from major depression. However, there is no indication whatsoever in these submissions regarding how her depression would affect her ability to perform the duties of her position. In fact, the evidence presented by the appellant does not provide a reasoned explanation of how her depression is, in any way, disabling. As such, there is no basis upon which to find that the appellant's depression entitles her to disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has submitted evidence that the agency attempted to accommodate the appellant's RSD and related restrictions by providing her with a position in which she did not need to use her right hand. In addition, the agency identified a van pool that she could use, given that she could not drive to and from work. Two of the appellant's physicians found the position to be appropriate for her. Although Dr. Patell subsequently indicated that the appellant could not work, in part, because she suffers from RSD, he provided no explanation as to how the RSD is disabling or why the agency's offered accommodation was inappropriate for her. Given the evidence presented by OPM and the appellant's failure to show that her employing agency is unable to reasonably accommodate her, <span class="Italic">see Breyer v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 628, 630 (1992), despite her subjective claims of pain and disability, she is not entitled to disability retirement benefits based upon her injury and resultant RSD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, as the administrative judge determined, there is no indication in the record that the appellant's performance in her IMS position was deficient. Rather, it appears that, as a result of her injury and resultant absence from work, other employees had to perform her duties. In the supervisor's statement that was made in connection with the appellant's disability retirement application, her supervisor stated that her workload was performed "by other co-workers creating backlog for the entire group. The supervisor also indicated that the appellant had been absent from work from August 21, 1994 until February 22, 1996, when the supervisor completed her statement regarding the appellant's disability retirement application. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Given the appellant's extended absence from work, the agency's suitable offer of accommodation, and the appellant's refusal to accept the accommodated position, it seems most likely that, if the agency removed her; such action, no matter how denominated, was based upon her absence from work rather than her actual physical inability to perform her duties. In any event, based upon the appellant's lack of medical evidence to establish that her depression is disabling, coupled with OPM's submission of evidence regarding the agency's efforts to accommodate her injury and RSD, we find that the totality of the evidence establishes that the appellant is not disabled and that the administrative judge therefore correctly affirmed OPM's final decision. <span class="Italic">See Trevan,</span> 69 F.3d at 527.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Rucker v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 669, 673-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11, 2012 MSPB 35 (2012), OPM does not necessarily have to produce additional evidence; it may rebut a <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption by demonstrating the lack of evidence of how the appellant's condition left her unable to perform her job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge acknowledged that the appellant failed to submit objective medical evidence showing that she was unable to provide useful and efficient service in the performance of the specific requirements of her position. However, the administrative judge stated that notwithstanding the appellant's failure, OPM did not offer any specific evidence, such as testimony from one of the appellant's supervisors or co-employees, showing the appellant had the capacity to perform useful and efficient service in her position. By requiring OPM to produce additional evidence showing the appellant was able to perform useful and efficient service in order to rebut the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption, rather than allowing OPM to rebut the presumption by demonstrating a lack of evidence showing how the appellant's condition rendered her unable to perform her job duties, the administrative judge required OPM to meet a higher burden of production than that required under <span class="Italic">Trevan. See Lewis,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6; 10 (holding that, contrary to the administrative judge's finding that OPM failed to rebut the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption, OPM was not required to submit additional evidence to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case). Accordingly, OPM's argument that it rebutted the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption of disability by showing a lack of medical evidence explaining how the appellant was unable to perform her specific work requirements has merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant is not required to submit medical evidence showing how her medical condition prevented her from performing her job duties to prove entitlement to disability retirement benefits</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, OPM argues that the appellant failed to produce medical evidence explaining how her medical conditions precluded her from performing her specific job duties prior to her removal. While OPM is correct, and the administrative judge agreed, the Board recently overruled a line of cases that indicated that there is a "general" rule that such evidence is required to prove entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-19 (2012); ID at 5. The Board in <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> provided a framework under which to analyze a claim for disability retirement, which we discuss below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> the Board noted that, under the Civil Service Retirement System, OPM's implementing regulation describes two ways to meet the statutory requirement that the employee "be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position": (1) by showing that the medical condition caused a deficiency in performance, attendance, or conduct; or (2) by showing that the medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in the position.<span class="Italic"> Henderson,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 16 <span class="Italic">(citing Gometz v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 115, 121 (1995)). The applicable FERS statute and regulation contain the same relevant language. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(2). Under the first method, the employee can establish entitlement by showing that her medical condition affected her ability to perform specific work requirements, prevented her from being regular in attendance, or caused her to act inappropriately. <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 16. Alternatively, the employee can show that her medical condition is inconsistent with working in general, in a particular line of work, or in a particular type of work setting. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> But regardless of the particular method of establishing an inability to render useful and efficient service, the burden of proof in every case is by a preponderance of the evidence, i.e., more likely true than not. <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a), (c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b), 1201.4(q)] . Thus, if the totality of the evidence indicates that it is more likely true than untrue that an employee's medical impairments preclude her from rendering useful and efficient service, then the employee has met her burden of establishing entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge did not have the benefit of <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> <span id="Page_4182"></span>because it was issued after the initial decision. Accordingly, we find that it is necessary to remand this appeal in order to determine whether the appellant met her burden of establishing entitlement to disability retirement benefits under <span class="Italic">Henderson.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">A detailed example of the shifting analysis and burdens of proof of the appellant and OPM under <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> is provided by <span class="Italic">Newkirk v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant has 18 months of FERS creditable service. However, in regard to the remainder of the criteria, the AJ found that, as a result of the appellant's separation from her position by her employing agency due to her medical inability to perform the duties and responsibilities of her position, she was entitled to a presumption that she satisfied the criteria for FERS disability retirement benefits in accordance with the decision in <span class="Italic">Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 996 F.2d 290, 294 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (an employee's removal for physical inability to perform the essential functions of his position constitutes <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that he is entitled to disability retirement; the burden of production then shifts to OPM to produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the appellant is not entitled to disability retirement benefits; and if OPM produces such evidence, the appellant must then come forward with evidence to rebut OPM's assertion that he is not entitled to benefits). ID at 2-6. We see no error in the AJ's finding that the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption is applicable in this case. <span class="Italic">See McCurdy v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the AJ found that OPM failed to present evidence or argument that rebutted the presumption of entitlement. OPM need not produce additional medical or other evidence in order to meet its burden of production. OPM may meet its burden of production by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 F.3d 520, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6; 10 (2000). OPM met its burden of production in this case by pointing out that the appellant had provided it with medical examinations of her back, neck and head that revealed no abnormalities, and the fact that none of the appellant's medical evidence provided a reasoned explanation of how her claimed neck condition rendered her unable to perform her specific work requirements. Thus, the AJ's finding that OPM failed to meet its burden of production to rebut the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The AJ erred in finding that the evidence in this case was such that the appellant did not need to show that her claimed disabling condition prevented her from performing the specific duties of her position or rendered her unable to render useful and efficient service in her position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appellant had presented competent medical evidence that supported her subjective testimony of her pain and inability to work in her position. The AJ also found that the fact that the appellant's medical evidence does not provide a reasoned explanation of how her claimed medical condition affects the specific work requirements of her "primarily sedentary" position was of no consequence because the Board found in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996), that an employee's disability retirement does not always turn on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the AJ erred in effectively finding that the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception to the requirement of showing how the employee's claimed disabling condition affects the employee's ability to perform the specific duties of the employee's position is applicable under the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the AJ did not analyze the appellant's position description and determine that her claimed medical condition precluded her from performing the specific duties of her position, the AJ necessarily relied on the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception in order to find that the appellant had presented preponderant evidence of her entitlement to disability benefits. Under the Board's caselaw, there are limited circumstances in which a specific showing as to how an appellant's medical condition affects her particular job requirements is not required, i.e., where the medical evidence unambiguously indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 17 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 120 F. App'x 320 (Fed.

Where the position description and the medical evidence unambiguously and without contradiction indicate that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position, but the medical evidence itself does not describe how a condition affects the ability to perform, the Board will link the medical evidence to the job duties.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The medical evidence submitted by the appellant shows that MRI and CT scans performed on her back, neck and head, as well as physical examinations of those areas, failed to show any evidence of injury resulting from the motor vehicle accident. As a result of the appellant's ongoing subjective complaints of pain in her neck that radiated to her head and left shoulder, she was referred to the Origin Pain and Spine Center (OPSC) in Provo, Utah, where she was first examined on July 9, 2003.<span class="Italic"></span> The physical examination performed by OPSC failed to reveal any physical abnormalities or limitations.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The OPSC report contains a synopsis of medical literature addressing anatomical mechanics that could produce pain in the neck without some form of anatomical abnormality being detectable through diagnostic scans. Following the use of a local anesthetic to block selected nerves in the appellant's neck (a Medial Branch Block) on two separate dates, OPSC came to the conclusion that the appellant suffers from cervical facet joint arthritis. OPSC's July 9, 2003 report indicates that for patients with facet joint arthritis "there's a 70 percent chance the patient will receive relief from radio frequency lesioning." The appellant received "Right C2, C3, C4, C5 cervical medial branch radiofrequency neurolysis" on August 25, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant returned to work for 5 hours per day from September 8, 2003, until her second motor vehicle accident on October 27, 2003, after which she did not return to work. An October 29, 2003 report from Duane Blatter, M.D., indicates that an MRI scan performed on the appellant failed to show any abnormalities. A November 28, 2003 report from the appellant's Board Certified Family Physician, Sumner McAllister, M.D., for the appellant's disability retirement application, indicates that a CT scan following the October 27, 2003 accident also showed that her spine was without fractures or other significant findings.<span class="Italic"></span> Dr. McAllister's November 28, 2003 report also notes the appellant's subjective reports of pain in her neck, back and shoulder, and the appellant's statement that the radiofrequency procedure proved unsuccessful. Dr. McAllister opined that the appellant is "completely disabled and will be unable to maintain any semblance of employment."<span class="Italic"></span> In a February 29, 2004 response to OPM's initial decision denying the appellant's disability retirement application, Dr. McAllister merely indicates that, although the appellant is presently healing from the October 2003 automobile accident, "this does not allow for the determination that her injuries from the previous accident are 'amenable to treatment.' Her conditions from the first accident have lasted over one year."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's medical evidence is not unambiguous and without contradiction. The bulk of the above noted diagnostic medical evidence fails to show any injuries from the accidents, let alone injuries that would last for at least one year. OPSC found that the appellant's cervical facet joint arthritis would only cause her pain from movement, yet Dr. McAllister fails to provide a reasoned medical explanation for why the appellant was unable to perform the duties of her "primarily sedentary" position. Dr. McAllister's finding that the appellant is "completely disabled and will be unable to maintain any semblance of employment," is contrary to the fact that the appellant was able to perform the duties of her position for 5 hours per day from September 8, 2003, until October 27, 2003. Thus, the medical evidence does not unambiguously and without contradiction indicate that the appellant cannot perform the duties of her position, and the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception to the requirement that medical evidence provide a reasoned explanation of how the employee's claimed disabling condition affects the employee's ability to perform the specific duties of the employee's position is not applicable under the facts of this case. <span class="Italic">See Anderson,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to prove by preponderant evidence that she has a disabling medical condition that has caused a deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or that her claimed medical condition is incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in her position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that OPM rebutted the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption, we must examine the totality of the evidence to see if the appellant met her <span id="Page_4183"></span>ultimate burden of persuasion to establish her entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See Trevan,</span> 69 F.3d at 526-27; <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 665, &#x00B6; 6 (2004); <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 7 (1999). In spite of the shifting burdens of production, the appellant retains the ultimate burden of persuasion to establish entitlement to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A determination of disability is based on objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, and evidence showing the effect of the appellant's condition on her ability to perform in the position last occupied. <span class="Italic">Hardy v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 8 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The objective clinical evidence, MRI and CT scans and physical examinations of the appellant's back, neck and head, has consistently failed to show that the appellant sustained any injury as a result of the automobile accidents that could be expected to last for at least one year. OPSC's diagnosis of cervical facet joint arthritis is based solely on the appellant's report of pain in her neck, the performance of a cervical medial branch block using local anesthesia, followed by the appellant's report that the procedure caused the pain to stop, for a while. Thus, OPSC's diagnosis and medical opinion is based on the appellant's subjective report of pain in her neck. Indeed, the evidence in this case of the appellant's claimed disability is based entirely upon the appellant's subjective complaints of pain in her neck and the resulting headaches which she claims prevent her from performing the duties of her position. An employee's subjective evidence of disability is entitled to consideration and weight in a disability retirement case when it is supported by competent medical evidence. <span class="Italic">Weaver,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 8. The appellant's subjective claims of neck injury and resulting pain and headaches that prevent her from working are unsupported by the objective medical evidence in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, there is no objective medical evidence that provides a reasoned explanation of how the appellant's condition renders her unable to perform the specific duties of her primarily sedentary position. <span class="Italic">See Trevan,</span> 69 F.3d at 526; <span class="Italic">Lewis,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 10. The appellant's primary care physician, Dr. McAllister, indicated his opinion that the appellant is "completely disabled and will be unable to maintain any semblance of employment. However, Dr. McAllister's conclusion that the appellant is disabled is not supported by a reasoned explanation of how the appellant's condition affects her ability to perform the specific requirements of her position. A physician's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the physician explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements.<span class="Italic"> Anderson,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Weaver,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, with the exception of the appellant's absence from work, the record fails to show that the appellant is unable to perform the duties of her position. Unless there is corroborating evidence establishing impaired performance of the employee's duties, absence alone will not establish disability. <span class="Italic">Wilkey-Marzin,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 10. The record contains the appellant's April 15, 2003 performance appraisal which shows that she was meeting the requirements of all of the critical elements of her position. The record also contains an October 28, 2003 supervisor's statement, that was submitted to OPM as part of the appellant's disability retirement application, that indicates that she exceeded some performance elements until she was unable to work full-time as of January 10, 2003, due to her pain. However, it also indicates that the appellant was then working 5 hours per day and it does not indicate any deficiency in the performance of her duties while at work. The appellant's supervisor, Branch Chief Lisa Childs, also testified at the hearing below. Ms. Childs did not provide testimony establishing a deficiency in the appellant's performance of her duties while she was at work; and, although she testified that she did not constantly observe the employees that work for her, she testified that she did not notice the appellant showing any signs of pain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the evidence, we find that the appellant has not proven by preponderant evidence that she is entitled to disability retirement benefits. Accordingly, we REVERSE the initial decision and SUSTAIN OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>

Based upon this presumption, the burden of production then shifts to OPM to "come forward with enough evidence that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the applicant did not qualify" for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the IRS removed the appellant for "hav[ing] been on extended leave without pay (LWOP) status since July 13, 1993." A charge, however, must be viewed in light of the accompanying specifications and circumstances, and should not be technically construed. <span class="Italic">King v. Nazelrod</span>, 43 F.3d 663, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Here, the specifications accompanying the charge reflect that the IRS based the appellant's removal on its receipt of medical documentation from the appellant's doctor indicating that the appellant was "totally and completely disabled at this time and...unable to perform [her] duties," and on the concurrence of a "Federal Organizational Health doctor" with that determination. Therefore, we find that the appellant's removal for "hav[ing] been on extended leave without pay...status since July 13, 1993," when considered in light of the accompanying specifications, is equivalent to a removal for inability to perform for medical reasons, and that the appellant is entitled to the presumption of disability set forth in <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 275, &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (charge of "inability to work" warranted application of <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption); <span class="Italic">Bell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM charges that the AJ erred in finding that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to a disability retirement because she considered that the true basis for the appellant's removal was physical inability to perform, when, in fact, that reason was "fictitious, fabricated, and fraudulent." In so arguing, OPM challenges the AJ's application of the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption which provides that an employee's removal for disability, i.e., medical inability to perform her job duties, establishes a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to disability retirement, and shifts the burden to OPM to produce sufficient evidence to support a finding that she is not entitled to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See Bruner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 293-94 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption further provides that, if OPM satisfies this burden of production, the totality of the evidence is considered to determine whether the employee satisfied her ultimate burden of establishing, by preponderant evidence, her entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 294.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although she did not specifically cite to <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, the AJ applied the <span id="Page_4184"></span>presumption, based on the reason for the appellant's removal as agreed to by the parties in the document they signed in settlement of the appeal of her removal. The Board has held that it will generally give effect to the terms of a settlement agreement between an applicant for disability retirement and her employing agency in determining the applicant's entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 610, 614-17 (1998), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 144 (2000). The resolution of an appeal between an appellant and his employing agency based upon a settlement constitutes a final decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, and the Board has authority to enforce the settlement agreement once it becomes a part of the Board record. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 615.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant and her employing agency resolved the appeal of her removal by entering into a settlement agreement, and because that resolution became a final decision of the Board, we therefore find that the AJ properly applied the <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> presumption, and that the appellant established a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of her entitlement to disability retirement. As indicated below by the record, the appellant's evidence indicates that she suffered a medical condition with debilitating effects on her life as well as her job. OPM's PFR raises argument, but pure argument, which constitutes mere disagreement with the ID. <span class="Italic">Weaver, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But a settlement may not be determinative, <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. OPM</span>, 103 MSPR 481, 487 &#x00B6; 12, 2006 MSPB 289 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 18 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 91 F. App'x 660 (Fed.

If OPM, in carrying out its statutory responsibility of deciding claims for disability retirement, may look behind a settlement agreement to which it was not a party, then it follows that the Board, in carrying out its statutory responsibility of reviewing an OPM final decision, may also look behind a settlement agreement to which OPM was not a party. Thus, we find that the appellant's failure to apply for disability retirement until after being removed for misconduct is a relevant factor in this appeal and detracts from the force of his application for a disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 22 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 120 F. App'x 320 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, <span class="Italic">Prato-Easterling v. OPM</span>, AT-844E-13-0352-I-1 (NP 7/7/2014), determined that a settlement did not control the outcome of a disability retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant initiated the instant appeal. In April 2013, the appellant and the VA entered into a settlement agreement regarding her equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints. The settlement agreement provided that the VA would expunge the appellant's removal and allow her to resign effective December 31, 2011. In addition, the settlement agreement provided that the VA would prepare a memorandum informing OPM that the appellant was disabled and could not render useful and efficient service in her position, that she was not qualified for reassignment, and that there were no vacant positions at the same grade or pay level in the commuting area that the appellant was qualified to perform.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has previously found that, when the personnel action was an evasive device designed to allow the appellant to qualify for retirement benefits for which she would otherwise have been ineligible, OPM has the authority to disregard a personnel action taken pursuant to a settlement agreement to which it was not a party. <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6; 12. OPM notes that the appellant did not apply for disability retirement until the VA proposed her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, in <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, the appellant did not apply for disability retirement until after he was removed for misconduct. In the present appeal, the appellant filed during the period between her proposed removal and the VA's decision to remove her. <span class="Italic">Stevenson</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6; 12. Nonetheless, because OPM has the statutory responsibility to decide claims of disability retirement, and the timing of the appellant's application was potentially a relevant factor in this appeal, the administrative judge should have admitted OPM's exhibits one and two. However, though the exhibits should have been admitted, the administrative judge did not commit harmful error or affect the outcome of the case. Exhibit one was an SF-50 documenting the appellant's removal. We have previously found that the SF-50 is the customary documentation of a federal personnel action, but it does not constitute the personnel action itself. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). In addition, the SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, we find that not admitting this document did not affect the outcome of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for exhibit two, the administrative judge admitted the document as part of the appellant's exhibits. In addition, both parties introduced the removal decision letter, and the administrative judge accepted both exhibits, which reference the proposal notice. Because the exhibit and subsequent decision letter were accepted by the administrative judge into evidence, OPM was not harmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stevenson</span> was also cited in <span class="Italic">Duggar v. OPM</span>, CH-844E-16-0419-I-2 (NP 4/19/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge should not have relied upon the rescinded removal in determining her eligibility for disability retirement benefits because the agency agreed to expunge it from her record in the settlement agreement. She notes that the agency submitted both the proposal and the removal letters and that both the supervisor's statement and the reassignment and accommodation form reference the removal. In support of her argument, the appellant cites <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2001), for the proposition that the initial decision must be overturned because the agency fundamentally breached the settlement agreement by injecting evidence that it agreed not to submit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that the agency breached a settlement agreement when it submitted documents regarding the appellant's proposed removal that it had agreed to rescind. 255 F.3d at 1376-77. Further, the court found that, although the agency promised to use its best efforts to effectuate the appellant's disability retirement, submitting these documents actually undermined her application to a degree. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the agency agreed to make its best effort to send notice to OPM advising that the appellant was reinstated. However, unlike in Conant, the agency did not agree to make its best efforts to effectuate the appellant's disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4, 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While removal for misconduct does not preclude receipt of disability retirement benefits, an applicant's request for disability retirement in the face of a pending removal for misconduct may cast doubt upon the veracity of the application. <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 9. Thus, since <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, the Board has clarified that OPM and the Board may consider evidence of a cancelled removal when the agreement to cancel the removal was an attempt to allow the applicant to qualify for retirement benefits and as a relevant factor detracting from the application. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stevenson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 481, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2006) (finding that the administrative judge should have considered evidence of a cancelled removal action for alleged misconduct in adjudicating the appellant's disability retirement application because his failure to submit his application until after his removal for misconduct was relevant and detracted from his application).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant did not apply for disability retirement benefits until after her removal and the settlement agreement rescinding it. We find that this timing casts doubt as to the veracity of her application. <span class="Italic">See Wall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 15 (2010) (finding that doubt regarding the appellant's assertions of disability was appropriate when his asserted symptoms coincided with his termination), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 417 F. App'x 952 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Further, she was reinstated for several periods of LWOP and applied for disability retirement benefits thereafter, but she was never returned to duty. Thus, it appears that her reinstatement constituted an attempt to allow her to apply for disability retirement. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly considered the appellant's application for disability retirement benefits after she had been removed for misconduct in rendering a decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also states that the administrative judge should not have considered her disability retirement application as having been made on the basis of an imminent removal because the settlement agreement rescinding the removal was signed in October 2014, and she did not file her disability retirement application until December 2014. We disagree. The settlement agreement, which was signed on October 15, 2014, states that the appellant agreed to resign and would be carried in an LWOP status until December 13, 2014, regardless of any OPM actions or decisions concerning her retirement contributions. Although the appellant signed the settlement agreement rescinding the removal in October 2014, she submitted her application while she was already placed on LWOP status. We find that she submitted her application for disability retirement benefits after she knew that she would resign and prior to the last day of her LWOP status and that this constitutes a resignation in the face of a removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant has not established the extent to which her medical conditions could be controlled and that her application for disability retirement benefits in the face of her removal further detracts from her case. Accordingly, we affirm OPM's reconsideration decision that denied the appellant's application for disability retirement benefits.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Bruner,</span> removal of an employee for medical inability to perform, or disqualification for the same reason, was evidence supportive of a disability retirement application. <span class="Italic">Jeffery v. OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 151, 155 (1992), summarized the cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, while not according preclusive weight to evidence that an appellant in a disability retirement appeal was removed from his or her Federal position for reasons relating to his or her allegedly disabling condition, does accept and consider such evidence, giving it such weight as is warranted under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Valanzuela v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 49 M.S.P.R, 477, 482 (1991); <span class="Italic">Hite v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 27, 35 n.9 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency's finding that treatment related to the appellant's medical condition medically disqualified the employee from the job was a factor leading the Board to direct approval of a disability retirement application in <span class="Italic">Greene v. OPM</span>, 12 MSPR 235 (1982). <span class="Italic">Simmons v. OPM</span>, 13 MSPR 350 (1982), noted a court remand from <span class="Italic">Simmons v. MSPB</span>, 684 F.2d 1033 (D.C. Cir. 1982), directing reconsideration of a disability annuity denial when the employee was separated from federal service for inability to perform the full duties of her position. The court decided that denial of the annuity was inconsistent with a Board determination that the retirement application could be denied because the appellant continued to perform her duties in a manner that was useful and efficient.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A different result was reached by <span class="Italic">Page v. OPM</span>, 4 MSPR 377, 378 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's employing agency is the United States Postal Service. In his petition he alleged, as new evidence, that subsequent to the close of the record,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...an arbitration hearing was held, the same being stage four of a grievance proceeding. The United States Post Office stipulated with the petitioner herein that the injury...was disabling from permitting petitioner to fulfill any of the craft positions of the Post Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that this information, in and of itself, is insufficient to affect the correctness of the initial decision. The law is clear that an agency may find an employee too disabled to continue work, while OPM may determine that he does not qualify for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Polos v. United States,</span> 621 F.2d 385, 393 (Ct. Cl. 1980); <span class="Italic">Piccone v. United States,</span> 407 F.2d 866, 872 (Ct. Cl. 1969).</p>
