<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-147"><span class="space">b.</span> Enhancement for Payment Delay; Interest</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The normal rule is that interest is not allowable against the United States without an authorizing statute. <span class="Italic">Obremski v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 554, 553 (1986) (same result as <span class="Italic">Harris</span>); <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 31 MSPR 219, 225 (1986) (denying interest on fees; no specific authorization for interest under 5 USC 7701(g)). Lawyers tried to avoid the rule against interest by calling for an "enhancement" in <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Library of Congress</span>, 479 F. Supp. 945 (D.D.C. 1984), involving a promotion claim litigated in federal district court. The plaintiff won his case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, one of several statutes supporting fee awards in Board litigation. Mr. Shaw and his counsel suffered the usual delays in government personnel litigation, meaning that the fees charged by counsel had diminished in value by the time they were collected. The court held, to justify the interest award, that Title VII provides that fees and costs are awarded against the government under the same circumstances as they are awarded against private parties. The court concluded that interest was properly considered a component of counsel fees. <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> reached the Supreme Court, where it did not fare so well from Shaw's perspective, <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 106 S. Ct. 2957, 2961 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of express congressional consent to the award of interest separate from a general waiver of immunity to suit, the United States is immune from an interest award....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Th[e] basic rule of sovereign immunity, in conjunction with the requirement of an agreement to pay interest, gave rise to the rule that interest cannot be recovered unless the award of interest was affirmatively and separately contemplated by Congress....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do we find the requisite waiver of immunity from interest in the statutory requirement of awarding "reasonable" attorney's fees. There is no basis for reading the term "reasonable" as the embodiment of a specific congressional choice to include interest as a component of attorney's fees, particularly where the legislative history is silent....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he force of the no-interest rule cannot be avoided simply by devising a new name for an old institution....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]nterest and a delay factor share an identical function. They are designed to compensate for the belated receipt of money. The no-interest rule has been applied to prevent parties from holding the United States liable on claims grounded on the belated receipt of funds, even when characterized as compensation for delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Sherman</span>, 98 U.S. 565, 568 (1879). Thus, whether the loss to be compensated by an increase in a fee award stems from an opportunity cost or from the effects of inflation, the increase is prohibited by the no-interest rule.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shaw</span> eliminates enhancements for delays in payment of fees. <span class="Italic">Downes v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 36 MSPR 207, 212 n.2 (1987). Interest is not payable on counsel fees, either in the form of regular interest or enhancement of the fee for delay in receipt of the fee. <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 40 MSPR 604, 609 (1989). We add to the discussion a case that concerns the practice, essentially designed to secure compensation for delay in payment, of allowing an attorney to bill his past time at current rates. That practice, used in civil rights cases, was challenged as a result of the <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Kennickell</span>, 836 F.2d 616 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Board disallowed the practice, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Balaban</span>, 33 MSPR 309, 318 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Respondent argues that the retroactive application of current rates will "counterbalance" the delay in payment of fees....&#8197;We decline to award fees based on a retroactive application of counsel's current hourly rates. While it is true that there is judicial precedent for the use of current rates retroactively as a means to compensate for delay, the continued validity of such precedent is extremely questionable in light of the Supreme Court's recent ruling in <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 614, 622 (1994) (AJ properly declined to award fees at counsel's current rate rather than at the rate established under the retainer agreement, as adjusted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The civil rights statutes do not provide a basis for enhancement of fees to compensate for payment delays, <span class="Italic">Krape v. DOD</span>, 97 MSPR 430, 433-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that Walsh's current, customary billing rate was $200.00 per hour and that this rate should apply to all of the work Walsh performed from 1999 to mid-2001, even though Walsh's original fee agreement with the appellants provided for hourly rates of between $125.00 and $200.00. The AJ similarly found that M&#x0026;S's current, customary billing rate of $300.00 per hour should apply to all of their work, including work performed before they raised their rate from $250.00 to $300.00 as of May 1, 2002. In thus retroactively applying the attorneys' current rates to all of their claimed time, the AJ reasoned that "almost two years ha[ve] passed since they began representing the appellants," and relied on <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Lamm,</span> 713 F.2d 546 (10th Cir. 1983), and<span class="Italic"> Sussman v. Patterson</span>, 108 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 1997). AID at 7-8. In <span class="Italic">Ramos,</span> 713 F.2d at 555, which involved attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988[2], the court held that "[t]he hourly rate at which compensation is awarded should reflect rates in effect at the time the fee is being established by the court, rather than those in effect at the time the services were performed." <span class="Italic">See also Sussman</span>, 108 F.3d at 1212 (relying on <span class="Italic">Ramos,</span> the court approved the retroactive application of attorney's current rate). The agency argues on review that the AJ erred by applying the attorneys' current rates retroactively to all the hours, citing<span class="Italic"> Harris v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. 604 (1989), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Whaley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 340, 346 n.2 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Balaban,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 309 (1987). We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Section 1988, 42 U.S.C., provides, in relevant part, that "the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Missouri v. Jenkins,</span> 491 U.S. 274, 282-84 (1989), which also involved attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988, the Supreme Court endorsed the <span class="Italic">Ramos-</span>type approach, holding that "an enhancement for delay in payment is, where appropriate, part of a 'reasonable attorney's fee'" provided under a fee-shifting statute. The Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Clearly, compensation received several years after the services were rendered--as it frequently is in complex civil rights litigation--is not equivalent to the same dollar amount received reasonably promptly as the legal services are performed, as would normally be the case with private billings. We agree, therefore, that an appropriate adjustment for delay in payment--whether by the application of current rather than historic hourly rates or otherwise--is within the contemplation of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 283-84 (footnote and citations omitted). Moreover, the Supreme Court has stated regarding "federal fee-shifting statutes" that its "case law construing what is a 'reasonable' fee applies uniformly to all of them." <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague,</span> 505 U.S. 557, 562 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Pecotte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 165, 167-68 (1992) (relying in part on <span class="Italic">Dague,</span> the Board stated that "reasonableness is the overarching standard by which a fee award is to be measured" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) or (g)(2)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The overriding factor here, however, is that the attorney fees are to be paid by the federal government. Thus, the "no interest rule" is implicated, under which "interest cannot be recovered in a suit against the Government in the absence of an express waiver of sovereign immunity from an award of interest." <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw,</span> 478 U.S. 310, 311 (1986). As our reviewing court explained in<span class="Italic"> Chiu v. United States,</span> 948 F.2d 711, 719 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Court set forth in <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> two principles which are crucial to the disposition of this case. First, the Court soundly rejected any distinction between types of awards for purposes of the no-interest rule so long as the award compensated for the time value of money. The second proposition is that no award in the nature of interest against the United States is permitted unless expressly and <span id="Page_4687"></span>unambiguously authorized by statute. Here, the post performance adjustment to the attorney fee rate constitutes payment for the time value of money and, thus, the no-interest rule bars the award unless expressly and unambiguously authorized in the [pertinent statute].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Citations omitted.) "Because waivers of sovereign immunity to suit must be read against the backdrop of the no-interest rule, a general waiver as to attorneys' fees, without more, does not waive the sovereign's immunity from interest." <span class="Italic">Preseault v. United States,</span> 52 Fed. Cl. 667, 677 (Fed. Cl. 2002); <span class="Italic">see also Applegate v. United States</span>, 52 Fed. Cl. 751, 770 (Fed. Cl. 2002) (in refusing to enhance attorney fees for delay, the court relied on <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> and noted that <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> does not apply because it did not involve a case against the United States); <span class="Italic">cf. Jenkins,</span> 491 U.S. at 281 n.3 (in holding that "reasonable attorney fees" under a federal fee-shifting statute could include an enhancement for delay in payment of attorney fees, the Court distinguished <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> on the basis that <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> involved the "no interest rule," which "provides an 'added gloss of strictness,'...only where the United States' liability for interest is at issue.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(g)(1), 5 U.S.C., does not explicitly provide for interest on attorney fees. Thus, the Board has held, in attorney fee cases under section 7701(g)(1), that fees may not be enhanced, either by applying an attorney's current rate retroactively or by granting interest on fees, to account for delay in payment of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 614, 623 (1994) ("interest on attorney fees is not awardable in cases, such as this case, brought under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)"); <span class="Italic">Balaban,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. at 318 (the Board refused to apply the attorney's current rates retroactively in determining reasonable fees under section 7701(g)(1)).[4] Although these Board cases did not discuss <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>, 713 F.2d 546, and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Balaban</span> was issued prior to <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, 491 U.S. 274, they are still good law, for the reasons discussed above. We therefore find that the AJ erred by retroactively applying the attorneys' current rates to their hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board has also stated more generally, i.e., without limiting the statement to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), that its "statutory authority to award 'reasonable attorney fees' does not authorize the Board to award interest against the United States or to compensate the appellant for delay in receipt of his award." <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 75, 78-79 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. at 609 ("increased fees attributable to delay are prohibited by the rule that interest cannot be recovered in a suit against the government absent an express waiver of sovereign immunity"). We note, however, that the 1991 amendment of Title VII, which provides for "the same interest to compensate for delay in payment...as in cases involving nonpublic parties," "was enacted in response to...<span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310..., in which the Supreme Court had held that a party prevailing in a Title VII suit against the Government was not entitled to interest on attorney's fees because the provision permitting the award of attorney's fees did not expressly waive sovereign immunity from such liability." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of the Army,</span> 78 F.3d 645, 647 (D.C. Cir. 1996). We need not decide whether an enhancement for delay in payment of attorney fees is permitted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2), which is not involved here.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here may be extraordinary circumstances in which an attorney's performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to be compensated under &#x00A7; 1988 presumably understands that payment of fees will generally not come until the end of the case, if at all. <span class="Italic">See</span> 532 F. 3d, at 1227 (opinion of Carnes, J.).

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has held that attorney fees awarded under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), as is the case here, may not be enhanced, either by applying an attorney's current rate retroactively or by granting interest on fees, to account for delay in payment. <span class="Italic">Krape v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Banks v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 75, 78-79 (1993), added that interest on fees may not be awarded as a sanction to punish an agency for alleged delay in transmitting a counsel fee check to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interest may be available in cases involving a finding of discrimination. Referring to the 1991 amendments to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, under <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Army</span>, 78 F.3d 645, 647 (D.C. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown's petition for attorney's fees, expenses, and interest was pending when the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991. By the terms of that Act, each provision was to "take effect upon enactment" (that is, on November 21, 1991) unless otherwise specifically provided. &#x00A7; 402(a), Pub.L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, 1099 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In &#x00A7; 114(2) of the Act the Congress amended the portion of Title VII that applies to federal employees so as to provide that "the same interest to compensate for delay in payment shall be available as in cases involving nonpublic parties." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(d). This provision was enacted in response to the decision in <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310, 106 S. Ct. 2957, 92 L.

<p class="Body-Text">Effective December 22, 1987, the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, was amended to provide for interest on awards of back pay under the statute. The amendment does not provide interest on counsel fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 614, 623 (1994).

Thus, the appellant is not entitled to an enhanced hourly rate pursuant to <span class="Italic">Loeffler</span>."). [The amendment is reprinted in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-085.html#sec16-84">Interest-Back Pay Act</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier law, the Board lacked the authority to award interest on a back pay award. <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 31 MSPR 219, 225 (1986); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. VA</span>, 28 MSPR 664, 668 (1985). Interest could not be awarded as a penalty against an agency for filing a frivolous PFR. <span class="Italic">Montanez v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 218, 218 n.* (1986). The Federal Circuit also determined that interest on fee awards could not be obtained. <span class="Italic">Frazier v. USPS</span>, 790 F.2d 873, 874 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board properly held that interest may be assessed against the federal government only under an express statutory or contractual authority. <span class="Italic">United States v. Thayer-West Point Hotel Co.</span>, 329 U.S. 585, 588 (1947); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">United States v.

<p class="Body-Text">The effect of delay in the receipt of fees was reviewed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. MSPB</span>, 781 F.2d 191, 196 (Fed. Cir. 1986), allowing a lodestar enhancement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Crumbaker maintains that the Board abused its discretion in considering the delay issue. We agree. In its decision, the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]n response to counsel's contention that an upward adjustment for delay in payment is appropriate, the Board notes that "[s]ome delay in receipt of payment is inevitable in the law as in any other service profession. Accordingly, any minimal delay may be properly ignored...in setting a fee award." <span class="Italic">National Ass'n. of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319 at 1328 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board cited a valid proposition of law yet misapplied it to the facts of the case. At the time the Board released its decision, the delay in this case had already extended more than five years. By no stretch of the imagination is that a "minimal" delay. As another court has observed, "[t]he hourly rates used in the 'lodestar' represent the prevailing rate for clients who typically pay their bills promptly." <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Marshall</span>, 641 F.2d 880, 893 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The delay in paying fees in this case "deprives the eventual recipient of the value of the use of the money," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, and renders the awarded amount unreasonable. On remand, the Board will calculate an adjustment to the lodestar figure reflecting the delay in receipt of payment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board once suggested that fee enhancement may be allowed as a result of delay in the payment of fees (pending disposition of a PFR or judicial review proceedings), but declined to order enhancement on that basis when the agency apparently paid fees ordered by an AJ prior to a final ruling by the Board on an appellant's PFR concerning his fee petition. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 565, 568 (1985). Although <span class="Italic">Crumbaker</span> may have suggested a reprieve, it was short lived. Recall that on rehearing, the court substituted the lodestar adjustment discussion with a newer opinion based on contingency enhancement. The court omitted, after a reference to <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, any reference to enhancement for delay. As the discussion of <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> demonstrates, enhancement of fees for delay in routine civil service cases is a dead issue.</p>
