<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-135"><span class="space">a.</span> Enforcement Petition Regulation, Guidance</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.181-.183 (2022), compliance begins with a petition for enforcement (the terms "compliance" and "enforcement" are used interchangeably throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.181&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority and explanation</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2), the Board has the authority to order any Federal agency or employee to comply with decisions and orders issued under its jurisdiction and the authority to enforce compliance with its orders and decisions. The Board's decisions and orders, when appropriate, will contain a notice of the Board's enforcement authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Requirements for parties</span>. The parties are expected to cooperate fully with each other so that compliance with the Board's orders and decisions can be accomplished promptly and in accordance with the laws, rules, and regulations that apply to individual cases. Agencies must promptly inform an appellant of actions taken to comply and must inform the appellant when it believes compliance is complete. Appellants must provide agencies with all information necessary for compliance and should monitor the agency's progress towards compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.182&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Petition for enforcement</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appellate jurisdiction</span>. Any party may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision or order issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, or for enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. The petition must be filed promptly with the regional or field office that issued the initial decision; a copy of it must be served on the other party or that party's representative; and it must describe specifically the reasons the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance. The petition also must include the date and results of any communications regarding compliance. Any petition for enforcement that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Original jurisdiction</span>. Any party seeking enforcement of a final Board decision or order issued under its original jurisdiction or enforcement of the terms of settlement agreement entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision issued under its original jurisdiction must file a petition for enforcement with the Clerk of the Board and must serve a copy of that petition on the other party or that party's representative. The petition must describe specifically the reasons why the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Petition by an employee other than a party</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(2)(B), any employee who is aggrieved by the failure of any other employee to comply with an order of the Board may petition the Board for enforcement. Except for a petition filed under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, the Board will entertain a petition for enforcement from an aggrieved employee <span id="Page_4975"></span>who is not a party only if the employee seeks and is granted party status as a permissive intervenor under &#x00A7; 1201.34(c) of this part. The employee must file a motion to intervene at the time of filing the petition for enforcement. The petition for enforcement must describe specifically why the petitioner believes there is noncompliance and in what way the petitioner is aggrieved by the noncompliance. The motion to intervene will be considered in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.34(c) of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Under &#x00A7; 1201.33(c) of this part, a nonparty witness who has obtained an order from a judge that his or her employing agency provide the witness with official time may petition the Board for enforcement of the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Under &#x00A7; 1201.37(e) of this part, a nonparty witness who has obtained an order requiring the payment of witness fees and travel costs may petition the Board for enforcement of the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Under &#x00A7; 1201.55(d) of this part, a nonparty witness or other individual who has obtained a protective order from a judge during the course of a Board proceeding for protection from harassment may petition the Board for enforcement of the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;A petition for enforcement under paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section must be filed promptly with the regional or field office that issued the order or, if the order was issued by the Board, with the Clerk of the Board. The petitioner must serve a copy of the petition on each party or the party's representative. If the petition is filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the motion to intervene must be filed and served with the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.183&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedures for processing petitions for enforcement.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial Processing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;When a party has filed a petition for enforcement of a final decision, the alleged noncomplying party must file one of the following within 15 days of the date of service of the petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Evidence of compliance, including a narrative explanation of the calculation of back pay and other benefits, and supporting documents;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Evidence as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section of the compliance actions that the party has completed, and a statement of the actions that are in process and the actions that remain to be taken, along with a reasonable schedule for full compliance; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;A statement showing good cause for the failure to comply completely with the decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The party that filed the petition may respond to that submission within 10 days after the date of service of the submission. The parties must serve copies of their pleadings on each other as required under &#x00A7; 1201.26(b)(2) of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the agency is the alleged noncomplying party, it shall submit the name, title, grade, and address of the agency official charged with complying with the Board's order, and inform such official in writing of the potential sanction for noncompliance as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2) and (e)(2)(A), even if the agency asserts it has fully complied. The agency must advise the Board of any change to the identity or location of this official during the pendency of any compliance proceeding. In the absence of this information, the Board will presume that the highest ranking appropriate agency official who is not appointed by the President by and with the consent of the Senate is charged with compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The judge may convene a hearing if one is necessary to resolve matters at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;If the judge finds that there has been compliance or a good faith effort to take all actions required to be in compliance with the final decision, he or she will state those findings in a decision. That decision will be subject to the procedures for petitions for review by the Board under subpart C of this part, and subject to judicial review under &#x00A7; 1201.120 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;If the judge finds that the alleged noncomplying party has not taken all actions required to be in full compliance with the final decision, the judge will issue an initial decision resolving all issues raised in the petition for enforcement and identifying the specific actions the noncomplying party must take to be in compliance with the Board's final decision. A copy of the initial decision will be served on the responsible agency official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;If an initial decision described under paragraph (a)(5) of this section is issued, the party found to be in noncompliance must do the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;To the extent that the party decides to take the actions required by the initial decision, the party must submit to the Clerk of the Board, within the time limit for filing a petition for review under &#x00A7; 1201.114(e) of this part, a statement that the party has taken the actions identified in the initial decision, along with evidence establishing that the party has taken those actions. The narrative statement must explain in detail why the evidence of compliance satisfies the requirements set forth in the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;To the extent that the party decides not to take all of the actions required by the initial decision, the party must file a petition for review under the provisions of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.114 and 1201.115 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;The responses required by the preceding two paragraphs may be filed separately or as a single pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;If the agency is the party found to be in noncompliance, it must advise the Board, as part of any submission under this paragraph, of any change in the identity or location of the official responsible for compliance previously provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;The complying party may file evidence and argument in response to any submission described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section by filing opposing evidence and argument with the Clerk of the Board within 20 days of the date such submission is filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(9)&#x2003;Discovery may be undertaken in accordance with the Board's regular discovery procedures (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.71 through 1201.75 of this part), except that unless otherwise directed by the judge, initial discovery requests must be served no later than 15 days after the alleged noncomplying party files a response to the petition for enforcement as required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Final Decision of noncompliance</span>. If a party found to be in noncompliance under paragraph (a)(5) of this section does not file a timely pleading with the Clerk of the Board as required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the findings of noncompliance become final and the case will be processed under the enforcement provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Consideration by the Board</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Following review of the initial decision and the written submissions of the parties, the Board will render a final decision on the issues of compliance. Upon finding that the agency is in noncompliance, the Board may, when appropriate, require the agency and the responsible agency official to appear before the Board to show why sanctions should not be imposed under 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2) and 1204(e)(2)(A). The Board also may require the agency and the responsible agency official to make this showing in writing, or to make it both personally and in writing. The responsible agency official has the right to respond in writing or to appear at any argument concerning the withholding of that official's pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The Board's final decision on the issues of compliance is subject to judicial review under 1201.120 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Burdens of proof</span>. If an appellant files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with a Board order, the agency generally has the burden to prove its compliance with the Board order by a preponderance of the evidence. However, if any party files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with the terms of a settlement agreement, that party has the burden of proving the other party's breach of the settlement agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Certification to the Comptroller General</span>. When appropriate, the Board may certify to the Comptroller General of the United States, under 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(2)(A), that no payment is to be made to a certain Federal employee. This order may apply to any Federal employee, other than a Presidential appointee subject to confirmation by the Senate, who is found to be in noncompliance with the Board's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Effect of Special Counsel's action or failure to act</span>. Failure by the Special Counsel to file a complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1215(a)(1)(C) and subpart D of this part will not preclude the Board from taking action under this subpart.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A technical point: the Board denies, rather than dismisses, petitions for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. USPS</span>, 97 MSPR 97, 98 n.2 (2004). Under current Board regulations, the AJ issues an initial decision to resolve an enforcement petition. Under earlier regulations, AJs issued compliance recommendations and the review process was somewhat different. References to compliance recommendations under the earlier regulations will be found in the discussion that follows.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">General guidance concerning enforcement or compliance proceedings is provided at Chapter 13 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">COMPLIANCE</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.181-.183.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Petition for Enforcement</span>. Any party may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision or order issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, or for enforcement of a provision within a settlement agreement that was entered into the record for enforcement purposes in an order or decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, by filing the petition with the RO or FO that <span id="Page_4976"></span>issued the ID.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). A party may also file a PFE seeking rescission of a settlement agreement upon a finding of material breach. Any party seeking enforcement of a final Board decision or order issued under the Board's original jurisdiction, or for enforcement of a provision within a settlement agreement that was entered into the record for enforcement purposes in an order or decision under the Board's original jurisdiction, may file a petition with OCB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(b). In addition, an employee who is not a party but is aggrieved by the failure of any other employee to comply with a Board order may file a PFE if granted the status of a permissive intervenor. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">PFEs of interim relief are not to be docketed as compliance cases; rather, they are to be referred to OCB for treatment as part of the PFR process. <span class="Italic">See Ginocchi v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 62 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The PFE must specify specific reasons why the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance and must include the date and results of any communications between the parties regarding compliance. A copy of the PFE must be served on the other party or that party's representative. The agency does not have the burden of showing compliance with a Board order until after a PFE has been filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time Limits for Filing</span>. The petition must be filed promptly with the RO or FO that issued the ID, and if it is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied, the PFE must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). Determining timeliness differs when the issue is compliance with a settlement agreement, rather than with a Board-ordered determination. Where there has been a settlement, because the Board does not direct the parties to inform each other of the date on which they have complied, the issue is whether the PFE was filed within a reasonable time of the alleged breach. <span class="Italic">Chudson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 115 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 132 F.3d 54 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">PROCESSING PETITIONS FOR ENFORCEMENT</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Acknowledgment Order</span>. The appropriate standard acknowledgment order (ACKCOMA or ACKCOMB) must be sent to the parties within 3 workdays of receipt of the PFE. If the agency is the alleged noncomplying party, it must submit the name, title, grade, and address of the agency official charged with complying with the Board's order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(2). The agency must inform this official in writing of the potential sanction for noncompliance as set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) and (e)(2)(A) even if the agency is asserting that it has fully complied. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency must advise the Board of any change to the identity or location of this official during the course of any compliance proceeding. Absent this information, the Board will presume that the agency official responsible for compliance and all of the consequences thereof is the highest ranking, appropriate agency official who is not appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Either the CAJ or an AJ may adjudicate a PFE.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an appellant files a PFE seeking compliance with a Board order, the agency generally has the burden to prove its compliance with the Board's order by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(d). Any party filing a PFE seeking compliance with terms of a settlement agreement, or its rescission, has the burden of proving the other party's breach of the agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The acknowledgment order clarifies that the parties have a right to discovery on PFE, so AJs must provide time for discovery when requested and must rule on any disputes that arise and cannot be resolved by the parties, as would be true in a merits proceeding. Cases holding to the contrary have been overruled by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(9), which allows discovery but requires that it be initiated within a shortened time compared to discovery in a merits appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Hearing</span>. Although a hearing is not required, it remains within the AJ's discretion to grant. A hearing is highly recommended in cases involving issues of credibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Settlement</span>. The Board's policy is to encourage the settlement of compliance disputes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial Decision Finding Compliance</span>. When the AJ finds that the agency is in compliance or is making a good faith effort to take all actions required to be in compliance with the final decision, the AJ will issue an ID finding compliance or essential compliance. This ID is treated like other IDs and becomes final 35 days after issuance unless a party files a PFR with the Board. As is true with attorney fee petitions, the Board does not reconsider the merits of an appeal in a compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Coffey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 632 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial Decision Finding Full or Partial Noncompliance</span>. Unlike earlier versions of the process for deciding compliance matters, the AJ will issue an ID whether the ultimate finding is compliance or noncompliance. If the AJ finds that the agency has not made a good faith effort to comply in whole or in part and is not in full compliance with the final decision, the ID must resolve all issues raised in the PFE and identify the specific actions the noncomplying party must take to be in compliance with the Board's final decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(5). In addition to the standard service copies on the appropriate parties and/or their representatives, a copy of this ID must be served on the agency official charged with complying with the Board's order under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(5). The ID finding noncompliance must also advise the parties that proof of compliance with the ID must be submitted to OCB within the time limit for filing a PFR under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(e), to the extent the party decides to take the actions required in the ID. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(6)(i). To the extent the party decides not to take all of the actions required by the ID, the party must file a PFR pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.114-115. The complying party may file evidence and argument in response to any submission described in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(6) by filing opposing evidence and argument with OCB within 20 days of the date such submission is filed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The file, along with all other files related to the appeal, must be forwarded to OGC within 3 workdays of the date the ID is issued.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On August 26, 1985, the Board issued Notice 85-70 stating that it will decide issues concerning enforcement of final decisions within 65 days from the receipt by the regional office of a petition for enforcement of a final decision.</p>
