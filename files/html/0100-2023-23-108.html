<h3 class="h3" id="sec16-107"><span class="space">G.</span> PURGING OF RECORDS; MODIFICATION OF DOCUMENTATION, PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency must purge its files of all references to the improper action, and the SF-50 canceling the action must be so worded that it will not indicate that it was issued as a result of an adverse action reversed by the Board. The Board confirmed in <span class="Italic">Labadie v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 28, 30 (1984), that it has the authority to order, and routinely does order, the removal from an official personnel file of documents having reference to an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 1, 2-3 (1992) (IRA case involving AWOL charge); <span class="Italic">Dancer v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 235, 238 (1988) ("The Board has held that compliance with its order canceling an adverse action requires that all documents referring to the adverse action be removed from the appellant's official personnel file."). <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 517 (1990), affirmed authority to order the redaction of references to adverse actions in Postal Service cases. It was immaterial in <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span> whether the adverse action was reversed by the Board or canceled by the agency; the requirement that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> be restored remained the same. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 519-20. The Board's authority to compel redaction of files is statutory. Unobjectionable was the retention in the OPF of the SF-50 apparently restoring the employee to duty and stating that the action was taken under the authority of an order of the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 32 MSPR 488, 495 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Correction of records stems from a Board remedial order, e.g., reversing a removal. If not all charges are sustained, but the removal is sustained, there is no remedial order and the Board lacks the authority to direct correction of agency records reflecting the reasons for the removal, <span class="Italic">Rankin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DC-0752-11-0568-A-1 (NP 1/22/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board lacks jurisdiction over a petition for enforcement when there was no final order for the Board to enforce. <span class="Italic">See Dungan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 416, 418 (1992). The appellant argues that the Board has the authority to order the correction of records even when an adverse employment action is not reversed or mitigated. We are not persuaded <span id="Page_4920"></span>by the appellant's claims that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a) provides the Board with the authority to require the agency to correct its records because a decision results from the removal appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant cites numerous court cases in support of his claim that the Board has some additional name-clearing role that would grant him the relief he seeks. However, the cases focus on the due process rights of a public employee in continued employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532 (1985). The cases do not support the appellant's argument that public employees have a property interest in clearing their names in employment records. The cases address the due process requirements of notice and an opportunity for a hearing before being deprived of employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 542. The appellant obtained a post-termination hearing before the Board where he had the opportunity to present evidence and argument challenging the agency's charges. The administrative judge affirmed only one of the two charges and affirmed the appellant's removal. The appellant has received the hearing that he claims he is entitled to for due process. (citing <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134, 157 (1976) (plurality opinion) (a hearing afforded by the administrative appeal procedures is sufficient compliance with due process and to provide the person an opportunity to clear his name)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's reliance on our decision in <span class="Italic">Labadie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 28 (1984), is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Labadie</span>, the agency was ordered to reverse an appellant's emergency suspension and removal, which it did, but retained records involving the actions in the appellant's personnel file. <span class="Italic">Labadie</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 29. The Board found the agency not in compliance with its prior order by retaining these documents and required all evidence of the personnel actions removed from the personnel file. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 30. The Board found the correction of records implicit as part of the Board's original order that directed the agency to cancel the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the present appeal, the administrative judge's decision in its entirety was, "The agency's action is AFFIRMED." No order was issued, no personnel action was cancelled or mitigated, and the relief sought by the appellant in his petition for enforcement was not part of the initial decision. Because there is no final order to enforce for the appellant's removal appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear the appellant's petition for enforcement.[5]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency acknowledges that it has retained a separate file containing documents related to the removal. The Board has held, however, that this is permissible, provided the agency observes appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosures. <span class="Italic">Kellus v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 335, 339 (1987). Furthermore, although the agency evidently released documents from this separate file to the Department of Labor, we see nothing improper in this action. The appellant's agency was simply responding to that department's request for information regarding the appellant's claim for workers' compensation--a claim that was based on agency actions including those related to the appellant's removal. In bringing the claim, the appellant in effect authorized the agency to disclose the documents to the Department of Labor. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 8 <span class="Italic">Wigmore, Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 2388 (physician-patient privilege may be waived by conduct "plac[ing] a claimant in such a position, with reference to the evidence, that it would be unfair and inconsistent to permit the retention of the privilege")....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the appellant has not identified any document in her official personnel folder that refers to her removal, despite the agency's evidently having advised her that she could review relevant records to ensure that all references to her removal had been expunged....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Purging and maintaining files were discussed in <span class="Italic">Hassman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 356, 359-62 (1994), commenting on permissible records retention as well as on the nature of proof required from the agency regarding its efforts to purge records of references to a canceled adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kellus v. US Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 335, 339-40 (1987), we held that an agency must purge its files of all references to an improper action in compliance with a final order of the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Gonzales v. US Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 517, 519-20 (1990). We further held that an agency may keep records expunged from an OPF due to an appeal in a separate appeal file, provided that appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosures are observed. <span class="Italic">Kellus</span>, 35 MSPR at 339.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the agency submitted below an unsworn statement from its former representative alleging, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an agency personnel official informed him that the appellant's OPF had been purged. The administrative judge found in his compliance initial decision that this unsworn hearsay statement constituted sufficient evidence to show that the agency was in compliance with the Board's final decision. However, the unsworn hearsay statement of the agency's former representative constituted mere allegations rather than competent evidence of compliance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">May v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 MSPR 422, 423-24 (1993) (an unsworn statement from an agency medical director was insufficient evidence of compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order); <span class="Italic">Fontanilla v. Department of the Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 312, 316-17 (1990) (statements of a party do not constitute evidence as to the truth of their assertions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the agency has submitted on review an affidavit from Ellen Wolf, Chief, Personnel and Services Division at the appellant's installation, in which she states that the appellant came to her office and that she and the appellant together purged all documents from his OPF that he requested to be removed. The appellant has not challenged Wolf's affidavit. Thus, it appears that, at this point, the question of whether the appellant's OPF has been purged of all references to the removal action is now moot and we find that the agency is in compliance with our final order in this regard. <span class="Italic">See Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, MSPB Docket No. DA1221920259X1, slip op. at 2 (Jan. 12, 1994) (where the agency submitted evidence of compliance with the Board's final order and the appellant agreed that the agency's evidence showed compliance, the Board dismissed the appellant's petition for enforcement as moot); <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Department of Justice</span>, 54 MSPR 609, 611 (1992) (sworn statements that are not rebutted are competent evidence of the matters asserted therein). Therefore, any error by the administrative judge by accepting the agency's unsworn hearsay statement as evidence of compliance did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights and does not warrant reversal of the compliance initial decision on this basis. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the issue remains whether the agency has purged all of the appellant's records of references to the removal action in compliance with the Board's final order. The appellant alleges on review that the agency has not done so. Although the appellant clearly raised the issue below of whether the agency was maintaining references to the removal action in files other than his OPF, the administrative judge failed to address this matter. The appellant contends on review that the administrative judge erred by failing to address this issue and by limiting his analysis only to the question of whether the appellant's OPF was expunged. We agree. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the agency and the appellant cite to a certain provision of the FPM as providing guidance governing the expungement of records of a cancelled action. We note that the Office of Personnel Management has recently abolished the FPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 59 Fed. Reg. 2945 (1994). However, the FPM provisions in effect when the Board issued its final order directing the agency to cancel the appellant's removal are applicable to this matter....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, although the parties cite the August 20, 1992 version of the FPM, those provisions were not in effect at the time of the Board's July 28, 1992 final order on the merits. Rather, the provisions of the FPM issued on June 29, 1990 apply to the matter at hand. Those provisions require merely that when a cancellation of a personnel action results from, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, an appeal, "the [file] copy of the SF 50 and the material removed from the [OPF] may be [retained] in the appeal...file." FPM Supp. 296-33, subch. 32-5(e) (June 29, 1990). The provision further states that, if there is no "valid need" to retain purged records in another file, they may be destroyed. The FPM does not explain what constitutes a "valid need" for keeping purged documents in a separate appeal file or otherwise provide any examples of acceptable reasons for keeping purged documents in an appeal file<span class="Italic">. See</span> FPM Supp. 296-3, subch. 32-5(e) (June 29, 1990). Thus, we find that the FPM provides little useful guidance on this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span>, 44 MSPR at 519-20, the agency attempted to purge references to the appellant's cancelled demotion in its computerized personnel record system by whiting-out references to the demotion on each printout of the appellant's records. The appellant alleged that altering the written versions of the computerized record did not constitute purging the record and that, in any event, the white-out did not completely conceal references to the demotion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 519. The Board found that the agency did not purge its computerized personnel record system of all references to the demotion action and, thus, did not return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 520.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kellus</span>, the appellant alleged that the agency was maintaining an employee and labor relations file, as well as a supervisor's file on each employee, and that he had reason to believe that all information pertaining to his cancelled removal had not been removed from those files in compliance with the Board's final order. <span class="Italic">Kellus</span>, 35 MSPR at 339. The Board found that a remand was necessary to determine the nature and purpose of such files and whether expungement of those files was necessary to return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 340.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 1, 2-3 (1992), the appellant alleged in his individual right of action appeal that the agency continued to report a cancelled charge of absence without leave (AWOL) in various internal agency memoranda and reports, and had submitted <span id="Page_4921"></span>those documents as evidence in other actions taken against him or appealed by him. The Board found that the administrative judge erred by dismissing the appeal as moot because the AWOL charge had been rescinded, and by not addressing these and other allegations, and it remanded the matter to the regional office to allow the parties to address those issues and determine whether the agency had returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming in this case that the agency's statements of compliance constitute actual evidence of compliance, we find that they do not establish that the agency has expunged the appellant's personnel records to the extent required by <span class="Italic">Kellus</span> because the agency has failed to explain sufficiently the nature and purpose of its "Management Employee Relations File." <span class="Italic">Kellus</span>, 35 MSPR at 339-40. Further, as the appellant points out in his petition for review, the agency has not explained where the file is located, who has access to it, the circumstances under which its contents are disclosed and to whom, and the reason for its retention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ORDER</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we REMAND this matter to the regional office. On remand, the administrative judge shall take additional evidence concerning the nature and purpose of the agency's Management Employee Relations File, including, but not limited to where the file is located, who has access to it, the circumstances under which its contents are disclosed and to whom, and the reason for its retention. The administrative judge shall also determine whether expungement of documents contained in the agency's Management Employee Relations File is required to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. If he determines that such expungement is required under <span class="Italic">Kellus</span>, the administrative judge shall make further findings regarding whether the agency is in compliance with the Board's final order, and whether it is appropriate to order the agency to afford the appellant access to the file.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Labor,</span> AT-0752-10-0687-C-1 (NP 9/1/2011), resolved as insubstantial an agency's belief that it needed to maintain records of an action ordered canceled by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the Board reversed the demotion action and ordered the agency to restore the appellant to the GS-12 position. Implicit within this order is the requirement for the agency to cancel the appellant's appointment to the GS-11 position and to return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6; 5 (finding the agency must reinstate the employee to his former position and duties). The joint statement of outstanding issues reflects the parties' understanding that the agency must, among other things, cancel the appellant's appointment to the GS-11 position and cancel a promotion from the GS-11 Workforce Development Specialist position to the GS-12 Immigration Program Analyst position taken in an effort to reinstate the appellant to the GS-12 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her sworn declaration, the agency's Acting Human Resources Officer averred that, for auditing purposes, the agency cannot cancel the SF-50 appointing the appellant to the GS-11 position because a corrective action (the SF-50 appointing the appellant to the GS-12 position) must also show the action being corrected (the SF-50 appointing the appellant to the GS-11 position). Thus, the agency acknowledges that its human resources records still contain documentation of the personnel action that was deemed improper by the Board. The agency has provided no legal support for its position that <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief includes the retention of documentation of a wrongful personnel action in its human resources systems. Thus, although we appreciate the agency's belief that it has legitimate reasons for retaining the documentation of the improper personnel action in its human resources systems, retention of the documents does not constitute the required <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is unclear from the agency's submissions whether the documents discussed above have been properly expunged from the appellant's Official Personnel File (OPF) and only exist in other agency human resources files, it is clear from Board precedent that an agency's evidence of compliance must clearly show that the appellant's OPF has been properly corrected. <span class="Italic">Washington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 9 (2011) (an agency's evidence of compliance must include a clear explanation of its compliance efforts supported by understandable documentary evidence); <span class="Italic">Woodson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 6 (2003) (same). The record regarding the appellant's OPF supplied by the agency contains "screen shots" from an agency computer program and copies of outdated SF-50s with handwritten notations that documents referring to the improper demotion action (and the promotion action taken to reinstate the appellant to the GS-12 position) were removed from the OPF. Thus, the agency has not demonstrated that it properly canceled the demotion action and provided the appellant <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But an agency may keep expunged records in a separate appeal file, provided that appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosures are observed. <span class="Italic">Kellus v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 335, 339 (1987) (remanding for consideration of contents of other, specified agency files); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Raphel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 596, 604-05 (1992) (to implement a settlement calling for prior disciplinary actions to be canceled, the agency was required to complete SF-50s referencing the action canceled, e.g., the suspension, in the box designated "nature of action"; however, the cancelation was not filed in the appellant's OPF). Under <span class="Italic">Kellus</span>, the Board expects that agencies will provide justifications for files they maintain containing documentation concerning an adverse action that has been reversed. In <span class="Italic">Dancer v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 235, 238 (1988), it appeared to be the appellant's burden to identify files containing objectionable material and to then demonstrate "that the agency is required to remove the documents from the files." <span class="Italic">Dancer</span> added, as to files other than the OPF, that "appellant has not demonstrated that the agency is required to remove the documents from the files." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 417, 422 (1994), disapproved informal and incomplete correction of records:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the agency inadequately expunged some of his records. Specifically, he contends that crossing out "AWOL" on his leave slips and changing that word to "LWOP" is not sufficient to keep a supervisor from gleaning information that some type of discipline had been taken and reversed. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Documentation cancelling an action must be worded so that it does not indicate that it is issued as a result of an adverse action that was reversed by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Kellus v. United States Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 335, 339 (1987), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Hawkins v. United States Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 633, 638-39 (1993). Unsanitized records expunged from an Official Personnel Folder (OPF) may be kept in a non-OPF file, provided that appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosures are observed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> There is nothing in the record below, however, to indicate in what type of folder the PS forms 3971 and 3972 were kept. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge erred in holding that crossing out certain suspension-related forms (the 3972s), and stamping "void" on others (the 3971s), was in itself enough to satisfy the criteria for "expunging" agency records after an adverse action reversed by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Kellus</span>, 35 MSPR at 339.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the agency now contends that the 3971 forms are not maintained in the Official Personnel Folder. The agency, however, did not make this claim below, and even now, it does not present a sworn statement or address the location of the 3972 forms (in OPF or non-OPF files). Nor does it state, even as to the 3971 forms, that appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure are being observed. <span class="Italic">See Kellus</span>, 35 MSPR at 339. The agency is therefore still not in compliance with the Board's Order to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Dancer v.

[Refer to Chapter 1, "Challenges to Adverse Personnel Records Notations."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may be required to inform third parties of corrections in the appellant's employment status if an action referred to before Board action is then invalidated by Board action. <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. USDA</span>, 116 MSPR 319, 325-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2011 MSPB 48 (2011) (Member Rose concurring and dissenting in part), directed the agency to inform two other agencies, OPM (concerning a retirement application) and EEOC (concerning an EEO complaint), that the action taken was set aside and why it was set aside:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of enforcement of a settlement agreement providing for rescission of an adverse action, the Board has held that in communications with third parties the agency was prohibited from disclosing the circumstances of the settled action. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2009); <span class="Italic">Torres v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 12 (2009). We recognize that the circumstances of this case differ in that, at the time of the supervisor's statement to OPM and the appellant's EEO complaint, the administrative judge had not yet issued the March 31, 2009 initial decision ordering the agency to cancel the proposed removal and eliminate all references to it from the appellant's personnel records. However, once the Board ordered cancellation of the proposed removal, <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief required that the agency's communications with third parties not disclose the cancelled matter. Furthermore, <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief required that the agency take appropriate steps to correct official communications to third parties that contained information about the appellant that was contrary to the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4922"></span>Thus, in this case, we find that to afford the appellant meaningful <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, the agency must inform OPM that the supervisor's statement previously provided regarding the appellant's disability retirement application erroneously referred to a proposed removal that was found retaliatory by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The agency must seek to have references to the proposed removal deleted from the supervisor's statement or have a statement clearly explaining the circumstances surrounding the incorrect information in the supervisor's statement appended to the appellant's disability retirement application. Similarly, to the extent documents referencing the proposed removal were filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency must inform the EEOC that the proposed removal was found retaliatory by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The agency must seek to have references to the proposed removal deleted from the EEOC's records or have a statement clearly explaining the circumstances surrounding the incorrect information appended to the Commission's records.[3] Regarding EEO material maintained by the agency, such as a report of investigation or final agency decision, the agency must either delete references to the proposed removal or append a statement to the files clearly explaining that the proposed removal was found retaliatory by the Merit Systems Protection Board.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;While the agency must contact OPM and the EEOC as provided for in this decision, the agency is not responsible for the actions taken by other agencies in response to the corrected information. <span class="Italic">See Modrowski v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 9 (2004) (finding that the employing agency had no control over OPM's policy regarding the correction of retirement records).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant also complained below that his Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) records contained references to the proposed removal. In her compliance recommendation, the administrative judge found that "neither the proposal notice nor references to it are included in the appellant's [Office of Workers' Compensation Programs] file." In reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge relied on a declaration made under penalty of perjury from a human resources specialist in the agency's Workers' Compensation Branch. The declaration explained that the Workers' Compensation Branch was responsible for creating and maintaining workers' compensation case files and that the employee who provided the declaration had reviewed the file regarding the appellant and there were no references to the proposed removal in the file. In his submission to the Board, the appellant argued that the statement from an agency official was insufficient to establish compliance and that the agency should be required to submit certified copies of all records related to his employment. The Board has held that an unrebutted declaration made under penalty of perjury is sufficient to prove the matters asserted. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 6 (2009); <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 592, 595 (1989). Here, the appellant has provided nothing specific suggesting that the declaration from the agency human resources specialist is inaccurate. Nor has he provided anything suggesting that his workers compensation file contains anything improper. Accordingly, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding in this regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An IRA case may involve a performance appraisal, considered to be a covered personnel action under the WPA. In <span class="Italic">Smit v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 59 MSPR 327, 330 n.3 (1993), the appellant prevailed in his IRA case and the Board required the agency to reform the appellant's performance appraisal from "fully successful" to "excellent." The agency declined to do so, arguing that the rating and reviewing officials were no longer employees, the agency record retention system did not require records of that vintage to be maintained, and the appellant could provide a record of his performance by reference to the MSPB decision. The Board found the agency's position untenable. The late FPM Supp. 296-33, S32-6(a) stated that no reference to an appeal or complaint that resulted in the need for replacement of a canceled action may appear in the reconstructed action; accordingly no reference to the Board decision would be permitted. Record retention requirements concerning OPF's housed at the National Personnel Records Center called for retention of ratings that are three years old or less. The creation of a revised rating was not futile, because the rating would be of use to the appellant in applying for employment. Finally, as to the absence of officials who originally issued the rating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...This circumstance is hardly unusual and does not justify omitting the names of the rating and reviewing supervisors from the rating document, as the agency proposes. To the extent that the FPM does not address the agency's concerns, it should seek advice from the Office of Personnel Management on how to issue a corrected performance rating in this situation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In enforcement proceedings involving another IRA case resulting from a performance appraisal, the agency was required to give the appellant an enhanced rating. It did so with signatures of members of then management staff in the organization at the time of its compliance. The appellant was concerned that the rating was not signed by his original supervisors. The agency was in compliance as to the identity of the official who signed the revised appraisal. As to other changes that the appellant desired in the rating, <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. USDA</span>, 116 MSPR 319, 322-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2011 MSPB 48 (2011) (Member Rose concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the March 31, 2009 final decision in this matter, the administrative judge ordered the agency to change the rating on the appellant's 2004-2005 performance appraisal to "Superior." In her subsequent compliance recommendation, the administrative judge ordered the agency to issue the appellant a new performance appraisal for 2004-2005, without cross-outs and notations. In its November 16, 2009 submission to the Board, the agency submitted evidence showing that it had issued the appellant a new performance appraisal in accordance with the administrative judge's instructions. The appellant subsequently complained that the agency remained in noncompliance because the individuals who signed the appraisal were not his supervisors in 2004 and 2005. The agency countered, however, that the appellant's supervisor in 2004-2005 had changed positions within the agency and that the current managers of the appellant's office completed the appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the agency was required to change the appellant's rating to "Superior." The record shows that the agency has done this. The appellant has cited nothing requiring his appraisal to be completed by the individuals who supervised him in 2004-2005, and we are aware of no such requirement. The record shows that the agency is in compliance in this regard.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In his December 3, 2009 submission to the Board, the appellant complained that the agency had failed to provide the required justification for his rating. Thereafter, the agency provided a document, which it asserted supported the appellant's rating. The appellant complained that his name was misspelled and that the narrative simply paraphrased the examples provided to agency managers to guide them in preparing appraisals and did not address his actual performance. Nothing in the MSPB's final order or the administrative judge's compliance recommendation required the agency to complete a narrative regarding the appellant's performance and nothing addressed the content of any narrative the agency chose to produce. We note that there is nothing disparaging about the appellant or his performance in the narrative. The appellant cites nothing to support his assertion that the agency is in noncompliance in this regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a performance-based action under Chapter 43, or in an appeal from the denial of a within-grade increase, the Board may order the agency to correct the level of a performance rating to the extent of the appellant's success in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clapp v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 378, 380-81 (1996) (in a successful performance-based action and WIGI appeal, the underlying rating should be raised to a level deemed by the AJ to reflect the evidence of successful performance); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Shaishaa v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 450, 453 (1992) (to cancel a WIGI denial and moot appeal, the agency must take steps including, but not limited to, amending an ALOC determination and the underlying performance evaluation); <span class="Italic">Guy v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 37 MSPR 230, 232 (1988) (WIGI appeal should have continued when the agency's efforts to cancel a WIGI denial were incomplete because of the improper documentation of the appellant's OPF); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Holland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-11-0696-C-1 (NP 4/17/2014) (when the Board found that the appellant was constructively reduced in grade, the agency should have reissued appraisals at her proper, higher, grade level). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Bronfman v. GSA</span>, 40 MSPR 184, 191 n.9 (1989) (Board was without the authority, in a successful Chapter 43 case, to correct the appellant's performance ratings and direct the removal of derogatory material from a personnel file). When an agency failed to prevail in a removal based on medical inability to work, the agency was directed to amend the appellant's personnel records to reflect that the medical restrictions imposed by the agency were removed by the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wittl v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 20, 25 (1987) ("However, there is no requirement that all of the appellant's prior personnel actions be expunged of references to the medical restrictions.").</p>
