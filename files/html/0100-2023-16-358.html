<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-358"><span class="space">1.</span> Retroactive Bargaining Orders; Make Whole Remedies</h4>
<p class="noindent">The retroactive bargaining order (RBO) can be used in cases involving a loss of monetary benefits resulting from an agency's failure to engage in impact rather than decision bargaining. But the RBO is also used in cases involving failure to engage in decision bargaining. Under FLRA's current formulation of <span id="page_1627"></span>the RBO, it is generally employed when an SQA remedy would not be practical. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Asheville and AFGE Local 446</span>, 51 FLRA 1572, 1580-81 (1996), explained the use of an RBO to remedy the financial impact of a unilateral termination of the practice of granting employees four hours off on their birthdays:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, for the reasons explained below, that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The purpose of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is to place parties, including employees, in the positions they would have occupied had there been no unlawful conduct. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 44 FLRA 988, 996-97 (1992); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, New York</span>, 37 FLRA 570, 580 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Griffiss Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base), enforced</span>, 949 F.2d 1169 (D.C. Cir. 1991). In this case, however, it is not possible to do so because it is not possible to recreate events that have already transpired. That is, the employee birthdays for which administrative leave was not granted have already occurred. Accordingly, it is not possible, at this time, to provide time off so that those employees can commemorate past birthdays.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the Authority has broad discretion under the Statute to fashion appropriate remedies for unfair labor practices.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). In addition, as the criteria enumerated in <span class="Italic">FCI</span> are not all-inclusive, the Authority may rely on "other things" in determining whether, in any given situation, such a remedy is appropriate. <span class="Italic">FDIC, Washington, D.C.</span>, 48 FLRA 313, 329 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">FCI</span>, 8 FLRA at 606), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom. FDIC v. FLRA</span>, No. 93-1694 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 22, 1994). In exercising that discretion, the Authority will not order remedies that are meaningless, as a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would be in this case. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 770, 797-98 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, we do not countenance any disregard of bargaining obligations required by the Statute. There is no question that the Respondent's failure to notify the Union of the termination of the practice deprived the Union of an opportunity to bargain before employees were disadvantaged and at a time when negotiations would have been more meaningful. Indeed, the Respondent admits that it failed to meet its bargaining obligations. In our view, a bargaining order that gives retroactive effect to the agreement reached by the parties is appropriate. Such an order permits the parties to determine--through negotiations--the best way to provide relief for employees who were adversely affected by the Respondent's unlawful refusal to bargain. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Griffiss</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Base</span>, a retroactive bargaining order "is designed to remedy the effects of [an] unfair labor practice[&#8197;] on individual employees, a fundamental purpose of the Statute." 37 FLRA at 582. In directing the parties to bargain, we expect that the Respondent will make every effort to redress employees who were harmed by the Respondent's unlawful conduct. We further expect that if the parties cannot reach agreement they expeditiously will seek assistance from the Federal Service Impasses Panel.</p>
<p class="noindent">An RBO was entered in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Letterkenny Army Depot and NFFE Local 1442</span>, 60 FLRA 456, 457-58 (2004), to remedy a breakdown in substantive bargaining when the agency unilaterally closed a child care program:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is long established that the duty to bargain under the Statute requires an agency to meet its obligation to negotiate prior to making changes in established conditions of employment.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms</span>, 18 FLRA 466, 467 (1985). However, the Authority has recognized that a union may waive its right to bargain over a proposed change in conditions of employment, either explicitly through agreement or implicitly through inaction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States INS, Washington, D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 69, 73 (1999). In this regard, an agency may implement changes in conditions of employment when a union fails to request bargaining within a reasonable period of time after being notified of proposed changes, fails to submit bargaining proposals within a contractual or other agreed upon time limit, fails to bargain, or fails to timely invoke the services of the Federal Services Impasses Panel after the parties have reached impasse. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 55 FLRA 10 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the court found that the Respondent was obligated to bargain over the 2001 closure of the SAS program. There is no dispute that the Respondent began, but unilaterally withdrew from negotiations over the closure of the SAS program and closed the SAS program without completing bargaining. Thus, the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a) (1) and (5) of the Statute, as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we do not order a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy, we find that a retroactive bargaining order is appropriate to remedy the unfair labor practice. It is well established that the Authority has broad discretion to fashion appropriate remedies for unfair labor practices. <span class="Italic">See F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyo</span>., 52 FLRA 149, 160 (1996), <span class="Italic">citing Dep't of the Army, United States Army</span> <span class="Italic">Commissary, Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Ind. v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273, 277 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">reversing Dep't of the Army, United States Army Soldier Support Ctr., Fort Benjamin Harrison, Office of the Dir. of Fin. &#x0026; Accounting, Indianapolis, Ind</span>., 48 FLRA 6 (1993)). A retroactive bargaining order is appropriate where a respondent's unlawful conduct has deprived the exclusive representative of an opportunity to bargain in a timely manner over negotiable conditions of employment affecting bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, Renton, Wash</span>., 51 FLRA 35, 37 (1995). In particular, a retroactive bargaining order affords the parties the ability to negotiate and implement the results of their agreement retroactively, thereby approximating the situation that would have existed had the respondent fulfilled its statutory obligations. Furthermore, a retroactive bargaining order is used where it is clear that some employees have been harmed by an agency's unlawful conduct, but there is no way to ascertain their identity through compliance proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., Washington, D.C.</span>, 48 FLRA 313, 330-31 (1993) (Authority imposed retroactive bargaining order to remedy respondent's unilateral decision not to renew appointments of certain employees, requiring that any employee be made whole who, based on any agreement reached by the parties, is determined to have suffered a loss of pay, benefits, allowances, or differentials because of the respondent's unlawful conduct).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no question that the Respondent's withdrawal from negotiations deprived the Charging Party of an opportunity to bargain before employees were affected, and at a time when negotiations would have been meaningful. A bargaining order that gives retroactive effect to any agreement reached by the parties at this time is appropriate because it permits the parties to determine--through negotiations--the best way to provide relief for employees who were adversely affected by the Respondent's unlawful refusal to bargain. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 54 FLRA 914, 922-23 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the court's opinion, we set aside the Authority's earlier decision in 58 FLRA 685 and find that the Respondent violated the Statute as alleged. To remedy the violation, we order the Respondent to bargain with the Charging Party regarding closure of the SAS program with a retroactive effective date to mitigate the loss of child-care services to those whose child-care arrangements were terminated. We further order that the Respondent post a notice provided by the Authority acknowledging its violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS, MEBA</span>, 20 FLRA 273, 274 n.* (1985) (<span class="Italic">FAA I</span>), the agency failed to negotiate procedures and arrangements for unit employees adversely affected by a reorganization through diminution of premium pay for technicians. Noting the lack of an agency exception to the remedy, FLRA ordered an SQA remedy, while FLRA commented as to back pay entitlement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also recommended that the Respondent make whole any adversely affected employee for any loss of premium pay suffered as a result of the reorganization of the Great Lakes Region Air Route Control Centers.&#x2003;The Authority finds such remedy is inappropriate in the circumstances of this case. In this regard, the Authority has previously held that in order for a backpay order to be authorized under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, there must be a determination that not only has an employee been adversely affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, but also that but for the improper action such employee would not have suffered a loss or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain</span> <span class="Italic">Region, Seattle, Washington and Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 14 FLRA 644 (1984). In the instant case, the Authority, noting that the Judge recommended the make whole remedy without applying such a test and the lack of evidence in the record to support such a finding, finds that a make whole remedy is unwarranted<span class="Italic">. See United States Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Agriculture, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service</span>, 17 FLRA No. 40 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, 20 FLRA 548, 563 (1985) (<span class="Italic">FAA II</span>), the agency was charged with implementing a RIF without notice to the union and refusing to negotiate the impact and implementation of the RIF, resulting in the separation of one employee, Panek, and an increase in workload for employees retained. FLRA ordered rescission of the RIF, restoration of Mr. Panek, and bargaining as to procedures and appropriate arrangements as to the RIF. But, as to back pay for Mr. Panek, FLRA adopted its ALJ's finding that "it cannot be established that Mr. Panek's employment would have continued without loss of pay but for the Respondent's unlawful refusal to notify the designated Union representative, and unlawful refusal to bargain over the impact and implementation of the reduction in force."</p>
<p class="noindent">With back pay entitlement being the issue in both FLRA <span class="Italic">FAA</span> decisions, both of the cases were taken to court by the unions. FLRA's back pay analysis in the two impact bargaining cases was found deficient in <span class="Italic">PASS, MEBA v. FLRA</span>, 809 F.2d 855, 858-60 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The court remanded the cases to FLRA with critical commentary concerning FLRA's strictly applied "but for" remedial analysis. The court concluded that a back pay entitlement is established in impact and implementation cases if there is a causal connection shown between the loss of back pay and the failure to bargain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he "but for" step of the test is consistent with the language of the statute. Under the Back Pay Act, the only actions that provide a basis for a back pay award are those "which [have] resulted in" a loss to the affected <span id="page_1628"></span>employee. FLRA's "but for" formulation appropriately effects the causal nexus mandated by the statute itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA, however, has gone further than fashioning an unexceptional test; under the guise of its "but for" step, the Authority has established a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule against the award of back pay to remedy an "impact and implementation" bargaining violation. As counsel for the FLRA candidly stated at oral argument, where the agency's improper action is failure to engage in "impact and implementation" bargaining, the adversely affected employee will <span class="Italic">never</span> be able to satisfy the FLRA's "but for" test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule, the FLRA emphasizes that "impact and implementation" bargaining is procedural only, as the agency in such instances indisputably enjoys the substantive right to effect the underlying changes. The Authority then goes on to argue that "because it cannot be determined with any reasonable certainty what agreements the parties would have reached had 'impact and implementation' bargaining taken place, there is nothing in the records of these cases, and only the sheerest speculation otherwise, to substantiate that impact and implementation bargaining would have precluded the losses of pay experienced by the employees in these cases."...&#8197;The FLRA's position, however, ignores first principles, including the basic purpose of collective bargaining. Legally mandated collective bargaining provides an orderly vehicle for the formal articulation of competing positions so, if successful, a more universally agreeable course of action may eventuate....&#8197;To say that it is "sheerest speculation" to assume that bargaining might have resulted in a different solution is to say, in effect, that bargaining is a purely formalistic exercise, devoid of substance. Not surprisingly, we decline to adopt such a remarkable proposition which flies in the face of the elaborate regime of management-labor relations fashioned by the Article I branch.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA, it bears observing, has not been toiling alone in the back pay vineyards. Over the years, the judiciary has had occasion to analyze the merits of back pay requests. In our review of the not inconsiderable body of law pertaining to back pay, we find that courts have consistently recognized that an agency's procedural violation can work harm to adversely affected employees, thereby triggering a make-whole remedy (including back pay) despite the employer's substantive right to take the underlying action....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA attempts to distinguish this formidable line of inter-branch authority on the ground that the procedural rights at issue were intended to benefit the individual employee directly, whereas in the case at bar, only the Union's institutional rights, as opposed to the employee's individual rights, were affected by the FAA's failure to bargain. The FLRA's effort fails. The very purpose of "impact and implementation" bargaining is to negotiate arrangements for adversely affected employees. 5 USC 7106(b)(3). It is evident that an agency's refusal to bargain over such matters results not only in harm to the Union's institutional interests; violation of the bargaining obligation has a direct, concrete impact on individual employees. In this context, it is beyond cavil that the Union is <span class="Italic">representing</span> the interests of its members, not advancing the interests of the Union <span class="Italic">qua</span> Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the insurmountable barrier to back pay recovery erected by the FLRA cannot stand. In applying the "but for" test to procedural violations, the Authority is obliged to recognize the value, fundamental in law and common sense, of procedural integrity; specifically, the Authority must allow for the fact that it is, in the nature of things, highly difficult for an adversely affected employee to establish that bargaining which never occurred (by virtue of the employer-agency's violation) would have prevented the loss of pay occasioned by the change.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;It scarcely needs to be said that we in no wise suggest that every procedural violation ineluctably results in back pay. Far from it, the employer must be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate the requisite causal nexus under the Back Pay Act did not exist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We do not hold that the affected individuals in these two cases are entitled to back pay, nor do we suggest that any <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule in favor of the adversely affected employees obtains under the Back Pay Act. To the contrary, we hold only that the Back Pay Act permits a back pay award to affected employees of an agency that has failed to engage in "impact and implementation" bargaining, so long as the employees meet the initial burden of establishing a causal nexus between the violation and the loss of pay. Accordingly, we grant the petitions for review and remand to the Authority for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand from the D.C. Circuit involving the<span class="Italic"> FAA</span> reorganization case with less direct effects, FLRA stated the test it would use in impact bargaining cases arguably involving back pay in <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, 27 FLRA 230 (1987) (<span class="Italic">FAA II</span>) (finding that direct entitlement to back pay was warranted for employees), <span class="Italic">partially overruled by</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 37 FLRA 278 (1990), <span class="Italic">post</span>. FLRA declared in <span class="Italic">FAA II</span>, 27 FLRA at 232-35:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with the decision of the court, we have further considered the issue of backpay in cases of a refusal to bargain over "impact and implementation," and we have formulated an approach which we believe to be consistent with the Back Pay Act and the purposes and policies of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Approach</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;"<span class="Italic">Unjustified or unwarranted personnel action</span>"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A decision on whether an employee is entitled to an award of backpay under the Act first requires a determination that the employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.&#x2003;Under Authority precedent, this is established when it is determined that the employee was affected by an unfair labor practice under the Statute....&#8197;This includes a refusal-to-bargain violation under section 7116(a)(5)....&#8197;In refusal-to-bargain cases, the unjustified personnel action is not merely the agency's refusal to bargain. The unjustified action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act is the agency's action of changing the conditions of employment of unit employees without providing the exclusive representative with an opportunity to bargain as required by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;"<span class="Italic">Withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee</span>"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When it has been determined that the employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, it must be further determined that the unjustified personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or reduction in the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials within the meaning of the Act. For example, in <span class="Italic">FAA, Washington, D.C.</span>, it must be established that the unjustified personnel action--implementation by the agency of a reorganization without bargaining as required by the Statute--resulted in the withdrawal or reduction in the pay, allowances, or differentials of affected employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The "but for" nexus</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When it has been determined (1) that an employee was affected by an agency's unjustified personnel action, and (2) that the agency action resulted in a withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials, the final determination necessary for an award of backpay is that but for the unjustified personnel action, the employee otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. In some unfair labor practice cases, this causal relationship is clearly established. In these cases, we will continue to specifically order backpay as corrective action for the unfair labor practice involved to make the employee whole. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">San Antonio Area Office</span>, 24 FLRA No. 84.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the court in <span class="Italic">PASS</span>, in refusal-to-bargain cases it is difficult to establish that the bargaining which should have occurred would have prevented any of the loss in pay, allowances, or differentials. In such a case it cannot be established with certainty that the withdrawal or reduction would not have occurred "but for" the refusal to bargain. However, denial of a backpay remedy on this basis would imply that the bargaining could not have prevented or lessened the monetary loss of the affected employees. This implication conflicts with the expectation of Congress that bargaining as required by the Statute would affect the manner in which such agency actions are implemented....&#8197;Moreover, backpay remedies can be ordered in these cases consistent with the "but for" test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency has been shown to have violated the Statute by refusing to bargain, the Authority orders the agency to bargain consistent with its obligation under the Statute....&#8197;When the ordered bargaining is completed, with assistance from the Federal Service Impasses Panel, if necessary, the effect of the bargaining on the withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials of affected employees will be known. Accordingly, where an agency has violated the Statute by refusing to bargain regarding a change in a condition of employment and the change resulted in a withdrawal or reduction in the pay, allowances, or differentials of affected unit employees, an order directing bargaining and the payment of backpay consistent with the outcome of the bargaining is an appropriate remedy for the agency's violation. Because the result of the ordered bargaining will most closely approximate the result which would have occurred if the agency had initially bargained as required, an agreement providing for adjustment of the withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials of affected employees will satisfy the Back Pay Act requirement for a causal nexus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, a backpay award under the Back Pay Act requires a determination (1) that an employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, (2) that the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action resulted in a withdrawal or reduction in the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee, and (3) that the withdrawal or reduction would not have occurred but for the unjustified action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first requirement is met when it is established that employees were affected by an agency unfair labor practice, including a refusal-to-bargain violation. The second requirement is met when it has been shown that the agency action which gave rise to the violation resulted in a withdrawal or <span id="page_1629"></span>reduction in the pay, allowances, or differentials of employees. If these requirements are met in a refusal-to-bargain case, we will conclude that the violation warrants a remedy of backpay. This remedy will require an award of backpay which is consistent with the results of the ordered bargaining, subject to the parties agreeing otherwise. Any disputes over whether the ordered bargaining resulted in any agreement which eliminated or reduced the withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials can be raised as a compliance matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, this approach is consistent with and best implements the mandates of the Back Pay Act in cases of this sort. Further, this approach is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Statute. It implements the expectation of Congress that bargaining as required by the Statute carries the prospect of modifying the implementation of such agency changes. The approach is based on the requirement that agencies give exclusive representatives advance notice of changes which affect conditions of employment and is consistent with the Authority's policy, discussed in <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 21 FLRA No. 98 (1986), of ensuring that the parties and the Federal Service Impasses Panel retain the flexibility they require to fashion agreements which are most appropriate for the parties' circumstances. Accordingly, prior Authority decisions concerning the application of backpay remedies in refusal-to-bargain cases which are inconsistent with the approach described in this decision will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand from the D.C. Circuit of the other <span class="Italic">FAA</span> case, FLRA directed a back pay remedy in the case involving the separation of an employee following a RIF implemented without proper bargaining, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, Eastern Region, Jamaica and PASS</span>, 27 FLRA 304, 306-07 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DOT</span> it was shown that the Respondent refused to bargain on the implementation of the RIF as required by the Statute. Accordingly, it is established that unit employees were affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. It was also shown that the unjustified personnel action--implementation by the agency of a reduction in force in the Albany sector without bargaining as required by the Statute--directly resulted in the separation from employment of Panek and a total withdrawal of his pay, allowances, and differentials. Applying to this case the approach we outlined in detail in <span class="Italic">FAA II</span> and have summarized here, we conclude that the Authority's prior order in this case should be supplemented with a backpay remedy. Since the bargaining order previously issued, which required Respondent to rescind its RIF and reinstate Panek upon request, it remains to require Respondent (absent agreement by the parties otherwise) to provide backpay to Panek consistent with the results of the ordered bargaining. The backpay remedy is limited to the period of Panek's separation as a result of Respondent's unilateral action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Federal Aviation Administration...shall...[e]xcept as otherwise agreed...provide backpay to Mr. Andrew Panek...to the extent that bargaining in compliance with the Authority's Order in <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, 20 FLRA 548 (1985), resulted in an agreement that he should not have been separated.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Dallas Region and AFGE, Nat'l Council of SSA Field Operations Locals</span>, 23 FLRA 807, 815-16 (1986), presented another opportunity for judicial review of FLRA's approach to remedies (provided in <span class="Italic">AFGE, SSA Council 220 v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 925, 928-31 (D.C. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>), particularly the use of retroactive bargaining orders, in impact bargaining cases. The case involved failure of the agency to bargain over the impact of implementation of new "accountability plans" for assessing employee performance. The FLRA ALJ ordered an SQA remedy requiring the agency to withdraw the accountability plans, destroy resultant documentation, and make whole employees adversely affected by the plans. FLRA, however, issued a prospective bargaining order, and disavowed an SQA remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge, among other things, ordered the withdrawal of accountability plans and the destruction of certain documentation that resulted from employing those plans; that is, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> order. In our view, such a remedy is not warranted here. We have balanced the nature and circumstances of the violations against the degree of disruption in Government operations that would be caused by such a remedy, and have taken into consideration the various factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution</span>, 8 FLRA 604 (1982), in making this determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The accountability plans here were formulated pursuant to the PGS.&#x2003;There is no question that management had a right to issue the PGS, which was formulated pursuant to the mandate of the Civil Service Reform Act (1978) to all agencies to develop specific critical elements and performance standards. Moreover, a Congressional time mandate was involved. As the Judge found, the Union was on notice of the agency's intended actions, although it was not given an opportunity to negotiate over the impact and implementation of those actions. We also note, as indicated above, that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy involving the withdrawal of accountability plans or the destruction of documentation that resulted from employing those plans would seriously disrupt the efficiency of the agency's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is neither required nor necessary in order to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute. An appropriate remedy for the violations which we find in these cases can be obtained by requiring the Dallas Region to instruct its McAllen and El Paso District Offices to bargain (1) on the manner in which employees will participate in the preparation of employee accountability plans required by the Personnel Guide for Supervisors, (2) on the implementation of those accountability plans, and (3) on the procedures and appropriate arrangements for employees whose performance appraisals have been adversely affected by such accountability plans.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as we have stated in issuing prospective bargaining orders and rejecting contentions that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy should be granted under circumstances where the potential disruption to an agency's operations was substantial:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A prospective bargaining order is neither inadequate nor inherently restrictive of the parties' right to address the effects on unit employees of changes already made....&#8197;Rather, it allows the parties the flexibility to bargain freely with regard to how past actions may have affected any given employee. Bargaining which explores such effects may itself reveal situations that call for retroactive remedial action, about which the parties are free to agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 21 FLRA No. 98 (1986), slip op. at 3-4, quoted in <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 23 FLRA No. 28 (1986), slip op. at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for us to order adversely affected employees to be made whole, although that may be the result of the parties' bargaining which we are ordering. We shall also issue appropriate orders to remedy the bypass and formal discussions violations by the McAllen and El Paso District offices.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Dallas Region and AFGE</span>, 23 FLRA 807 (1986), was reviewed <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE SSA Council 220 v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 925, 928-31 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The court explained why FLRA should, when possible, fashion individualized relief when it enters bargaining orders:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Act imposes on the Authority a clear duty to vindicate employee bargaining rights by making whole employees adversely affected by bargaining violations.&#x2003;Section 7118(a)(7) of the Act expresses in mandatory terms the statute's policy to remedy each violation to the fullest possible extent by providing that the Authority "shall * * * order" some combination of relief, including renegotiation with retroactive effect, and back pay with reinstatement, "or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter." &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7)(D). In determining whether adoption of the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> balancing test and its application in this case offend this paramount goal of the Act, our review must be confined to consideration of whether the FLRA's action was "arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7123(c) (directing review of the Authority's orders in accordance with &#x00A7; 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC 706 (1976)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We decline to reject outright the Authority's <span class="Italic">FCI</span> "balancing" approach as inconsistent with the policies and purposes of the Act. We do not deprecate the importance of all aspects of employee bargaining rights, or the courts' clear duty to protect them vigilantly. Nevertheless, there is good reason why the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> test mandates careful consideration of any impact on agency efficiency when awarding SQA relief for failure to negotiate over implementation. In cases where a proposed change in working conditions is fully negotiable, a remedy for failure to negotiate or bargain will not ordinarily result in measures which interfere with management prerogatives. In contrast, a SQA award for deprivation of 7106(b)(2) and (3) rights will often "disrupt" the agency by usurping the authority conferred on management by 7106(a). (Compare, for example, the effect of a SQA remedy for unilateral modification of employee health benefits--a matter fully negotiable because not within management's exclusive control under 7106(a)--with the derogation of management's role necessitated by a SQA order to discard years of employee evaluations.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is important to remember that Congress conferred 7106(a) rights on management to promote the expeditious and smooth operation of government agencies. By focusing on agency efficiency in mediating the frequent conflicts between employee rights and management prerogatives generated by SQA orders for "implementation" violations, the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> test respects management's statutory authority only when government efficiency really is jeopardized. For this reason, we believe the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> framework for reconciling competing statutory aims in reasonable and its application here is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We vacate the FLRA's decision to order prospective bargaining in lieu of direct individualized relief for adversely affected employees, and remand for fuller consideration under <span class="Italic">FCI</span> of this aspect of the ALJ's order....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority abused its discretion by failing to look closely at the impact on agency operations of each element of the SQA remedial scheme....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1630"></span>...The award of back pay or other individualized equitable relief through a grievance procedure would not appear to disrupt agency operations to a greater extent than determination through prospective bargaining. While the impact of the illegal evaluation procedures on employees as a group may be "minimal" because comparatively few are adversely affected, the impact is not "minimal" on those employees who would qualify for this aspect of the "make whole" remedy by demonstrating an adverse effect on themselves. These considerations would appear to favor SQA relief rather than the less certain redress of prospective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The propriety of this result is also buttressed by the discussion in a recent decision of this court, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 785 F.2d 333, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). Noting that "Congress intended the FLRA's role in adjudicating unfair labor practice cases in the federal sector to be similar to that of the NLRB's in the private sector," this court observed that "even when <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief is denied in cases of undue hardship, the NLRB will typically grant monetary relief, such as backpay, in addition to any order to bargain."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We read these comments as expressing a weighty preference in favor of a direct grant of individualized "make whole" relief--especially in the form of a monetary award--for losses actually suffered by employees. This preference is justified precisely because such individualized relief is unlikely to be as disruptive as a sweeping institutional remedy. The foregoing analysis makes clear that an order omitting the full measure of monetary relief will rarely withstand scrutiny, even under an "arbitrary and capricious" standard of review, because rarely will there be a sound statutory reason to withhold this recompense. Denial of such "make whole" relief should prove exceptional, not because tested by a different standard than applied to other types of remedial action, but because such denial is unlikely to pass <span class="Italic">any</span> test--such as the <span class="Italic">FCI</span> test--which properly takes into account competing statutory aims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The respondent insists that <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span> is inapposite absent an explicit request for back pay. While it is true that the union has not asked for an award of back pay, it is equally clear that "make whole" relief for aggrieved employees <span class="Italic">may</span> take this form. This court in <span class="Italic">Professional Airways Systems Specialists, MEBA v. FLRA</span>, 809 F.2d 855 (D.C. Cir. 1987), recently invalidated the Authority's <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule against the award of back pay to remedy an impact and implementation bargaining violation. The court there held that the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596 (1982), does not require that employees bear the insurmountable burden of demonstrating a "but for" relationship between the improper refusal to bargain and the loss of pay or benefits. Employees seeking this relief need only show the likelihood of "causal nexus" between the two. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 859 n.11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand in <span class="Italic">MEBA</span>, the FLRA reasoned that such "causal nexus" could best be demonstrated by comparing the impact of the unilaterally implemented practice to the likely effect of any agreement reached after completion of required bargaining over implementation. The Authority could then order "an award of backpay consistent with the results of the ordered bargaining"--that is, "make whole" compensation measured by retroactive application of the collective bargaining order....&#8197;27 FLRA 230, 235 (1987). Similarly, it should be possible in the present case to determine any compensation due individual employees by giving retroactive effect to the agreement resulting from ordered bargaining. Employees who believe they have suffered untoward effects of the new evaluations system will best be able to demonstrate a "causal nexus" after bargaining is completed.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Dallas Region and AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Operations Locals</span>, 32 FLRA 521, 525-27 (1988), on remand from the D.C. Circuit, FLRA explained as to "make whole" remedies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The purpose of a "make whole" remedy is to place individuals who have been adversely affected by an improper action in the situation where they would have been if the improper action had not occurred. We conclude that this remedy should include backpay for those employees who suffered a withdrawal or reduction of pay...as a result of the improper implementation of the accountability plans.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e have considered whether a "make-whole" remedy would disrupt agency operations. We find that the "make-whole" remedy would not substantially disrupt or impair the efficiency or effectiveness of the operations....&#8197;We also find that ordering that individual employees who were adversely affected by the improper implementation of the accountability plans be "made whole" effectuates the purposes and policies of the Statute by placing these employees in the situation where they would have been if the violation of the Statute had not occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For most of the employees who were adversely affected, this remedy will require that they receive the performance ratings that they otherwise would have received if the Statute had not been violated. This remedy also requires the correction of personnel actions that would or would not have been taken but for the violation of the Statute. For example, if as a result of the improper implementation of the accountability plans, an employee was removed or reduced in grade, this remedy will require that the employee be restored to the employee's original position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For those employees who suffered a withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials as a result of the violation of the Statute, the ordered "make-whole" remedy should include backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FAA II</span>, 27 FLRA 230, which was discussed by the court in relation to whether the individualized relief should include backpay, we formulated an approach for determining whether backpay remedies are appropriate in cases involving agency refusals to bargain....&#8197;We stated that a backpay award must comply with the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, and requires determinations that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;an employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted agency personnel action;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;the unjustified personnel action resulted in a withdrawal or reduction in pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;the withdrawal or reduction would not have occurred but for the unjustified action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FAA II</span>, we noted that the first requirement is met when an agency has committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain. The second requirement is met when the management action which gave rise to the violation resulted in a withdrawal or reduction in the pay, allowances, or differentials of employees....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">FAA II</span>, we also decided that when the first and second requirements are met in a refusal-to-bargain case, an order directing bargaining and the payment of backpay consistent with the outcome of the bargaining satisfies the third requirement: the withdrawal or reduction would not have occurred but for the unjustified action....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the first requirement was met by the Dallas Regional Office's violation of the Statute in instructing the McAllen and El Paso District Offices to refuse to bargain on the implementation of the accountability plans.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further conclude that in cases such as this, whether actual withdrawals or reductions may occur well after a change is implemented, the second requirement is satisfied when a relationship is shown between the improper change and the manner in which agencies determine the pay, allowances, or differentials of unit employees. Here, the Respondent violated the Statute when it unilaterally changed the process by which employee performance is assessed. These assessments of employee performance were to provide a means of documenting removals and demotions for unacceptable performance, awards, and the granting or denying of within-grade increases. These actions clearly relate to the pay...of unit employees. Accordingly, the second requirement of the Back Pay Act is satisfied in this case. In accordance with <span class="Italic">FAA II</span>, we conclude that an order directing payment of backpay consistent with the outcome of ordered bargaining satisfies the third requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit's analysis of FLRA's remedial scheme continued with <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 856 F.2d 293 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The underlying decision, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS Houston Dist. and NTEU Chap. 222</span>, 25 FLRA 843, 850 (1987), determined that the agency improperly failed to negotiate over allocation and cost of parking spaces required as a result of an office relocation. As a remedy FLRA directed prospective bargaining that could include the "opportunity to provide retroactive application of any agreement." Agreeing with NTEU that FLRA erred by failing to require the retroactive bargaining specifically authorized by 5 USC 7118(a)(7)(B), the D.C. Circuit remanded the case for issuance of a retroactive bargaining order, rather than a prospective remedy, as it noted its earlier holding in <span class="Italic">AFGE SSA Council 220 v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 925 (D.C. Cir. 1988), that a remedial determination that withholds monetary compensation is rarely justified for deprivations suffered by employees as a result of unlawful employer action, 856 F.2d at 297-99:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An approach to remedies that systematically fails to deter noncompliance, or dilatory compliance, with the Statute's directives is fundamentally at odds with the Authority's responsibilities....&#8197;Employees are left to bear the losses and suffer the detriments of working under conditions ordained by management rather than fixed by bargaining. Thus, retroactive remedies are an indispensable means to vindicate the Statute's central goals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority argues that any preference for SQA or "make whole" relief does not extend to orders for retroactive application of bargaining agreements. The Authority maintains that an RBO is not in the same category as an SQA remedy, and does not merit the same favoritism, because an RBO does not restore employees to the state they enjoyed before management unlawfully effected a unilateral change. In the case <span class="Italic">sub judice</span>, a true SQA remedy would consist of undoing the Briarpark relocation, which all parties agree is not feasible. The Authority implies that, although an RBO may return to employees those benefits they would have enjoyed had the agency initially bargained, one cannot assume that the RBO will have this effect; it is sheer speculation that the terms incorporated in the final contract will be those the parties would have adopted initially.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Authority does not believe that a policy favoring "make whole" relief should translate into a preference for RBOs. We disagree. A "make <span id="page_1631"></span>whole" remedy compensates individual employees for losses suffered and divests management of the benefits of illegal action. A retroactive bargaining order aims to do the same. The difference is that an RBO requires the Authority, or a grievance committee, to estimate the "make whole" compensation due employees by means of the convenient, albeit somewhat speculative, conceit of assuming that the agreement the parties eventually negotiate approximates the agreement they would have forged in the first instance. The retroactive application of a contract ultimately negotiated by the parties relieves the Authority of the need to speculate on the precise details of a hypothetical contract....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recourse to this remedial device is necessary in this case because of the nature of the agency's infraction. This is not a case where the agency effected an isolated change in a working condition it was not entitled to change without negotiation. Rather, the IRS exercised its lawful right...to relocate its operations, but failed to bargain over one aspect of the move--new parking arrangements. The entire relocation cannot be reversed without causing undue disruption....&#8197;By ordering an RBO, the Authority can avoid these consequences while compensating employees for the difference between what they received under the unbargained-for parking arrangement and what they would have received had the arrangement been subject to bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The key distinction is not between SQA remedies and RBOs as such, but between remedies that completely undo the institutional arrangements created by the unbargained-for actions of the agency and less intrusive "make whole" remedies. What in the case at bar is called an RBO, and what was called in <span class="Italic">SSA Council 220</span> an SQA (albeit a limited SQA), accomplish the same thing in the same way: both avoid institutional disruption while providing monetary "make whole" compensation to employees adversely affected by a refusal to bargain over a change in working conditions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the "make whole" remedy for refusal to bargain over parking charges is straightforward. If the union succeeds in negotiating a lower parking charge than employees currently pay, the employees will receive the difference in the amount paid for parking during the period of unilateral action and the amount set by contract. The measure of retroactive compensation for the IRS' refusal to bargain over reservation of parking spaces for management is less clear. We leave to the Authority's determination the factual question of whether it would be possible for the union to show that employees suffered monetary loss--e.g., in the form of higher parking charges--as a result of removal of some parking spaces from the general pool in the event that those spaces are restored by a negotiated agreement. In any event, a grievance committee need not award, and cannot calculate, this component of a "make whole" award unless the union can demonstrate some "causal nexus" between higher employee charges and the reservation policy. However, the possibility that retroactive compensation for refusal to bargain over this matter may prove infeasible does not undermine the Authority's duty to award retroactive compensation where its measure is clear; nor does it vitiate the requirement that partial "make whole" relief be awarded to the fullest extent possible. <span class="Italic">See SSA Council 220</span>, 840 F.2d at 929-30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority contends that the FSIP cannot fulfill its statutory obligation without the flexibility to order any action it deems appropriate to resolve an impasse. We disagree that an order by the Authority to give retroactive effect to the terms of a bargaining agreement significantly impairs the function of the FSIP....&#8197;The Panel retains ample flexibility to arrive at a fair and satisfactory resolution of a bargaining impasse and is free to adjust the substantive content of contract terms against the understanding that retroactive compensation will be part of the bargain....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It may be argued that this arrangement is a zero sum game for employees: the agency will simply offer less, knowing it is bound to a retroactive extension of the terms to which it agrees. It is possible that employees will sometimes be forced to give up at the bargaining table, or ordered to relinquish by the Panel, the equivalent of what they have gained by retroactivity, but we doubt that this is inevitable in every case. Bargaining rarely proceeds on a perfect economic model of costless transaction, and we think it is likely that the union will retain some of the advantage conferred by the privilege to retain or waive its right to retroactive application of bargaining terms....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the agency contends that an RBO will impose bargaining terms on the parties in derogation of section 7103(a)(12). The Authority takes the position that the proper balance between its remedial responsibilities and the parties' prerogative requires the Authority to refrain from ordering retroactivity in all but extraordinary cases. We disagree that Congress intended that the balance be struck to the detriment of the Statute's remedial goals. In section 7118(a)(7)(B), Congress specifically provided that, when necessary to remedy an unfair labor practice, the Authority "<span class="Italic">shall</span> issue...an order requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the Authority and requiring that the agreement...be given retroactive effect."...</p>
<p class="noindent">On petition for rehearing, however, the D.C. Circuit determined that FLRA had the discretion to decline to impose a retroactive bargaining order. Over the dissent of Judge Mikva, the court explained, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964, 967-69 (D.C. Cir. 1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Section 7105(g)(3) states that the Authority may "take any remedial action <span class="Italic">it</span> considers appropriate to carry out the policies" of the federal labor statute....&#8197;Congress then broadly listed in section 7118(a)(7) the measures the FLRA could implement to correct violations of the statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(7) If the Authority...determines...that the agency or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged...in an unfair labor practice, then [the Authority]...shall issue...an order--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;to cease and desist...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the Authority and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given retroactive effect;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;requiring reinstatement of an employee...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;including <span class="Italic">any combination of the actions</span> described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph <span class="Italic">or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner's textual argument...assumes that subparagraph (B) is the only provision that may be employed to remedy an agency's refusal to bargain, which seems a dubious proposition given the character of the statute's remedial prescriptions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e see nothing in the language of the statute that restricts the Authority's discretion to determine...whether and when to direct RBOs as a remedy for an agency's refusal to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner...relies more heavily on the argument that the policy of the Act would be frustrated if RBOs were not employed routinely to remedy refusals to bargain, an argument which, it asserts, finds at least some support in our cases. But petitioner's general appeal to the policies of the Act encounters at the outset the difficulty that Congress quite directly entrusted the Authority, and not us, with the responsibility to "take any remedial action <span class="Italic">it</span> considers appropriate to carry out the policies" of the Act. 5 USC 7105(g)(3)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, where an agency has taken unilateral action that disturbs the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> and has illegally refused to give a union an opportunity to bargain over the decision (or its impact), a stronger case can be made for the proposition that the Authority...<span class="Italic">should</span> restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> in a remedial order--that is, make the employees whole....&#8197;That does not necessarily mean that the Authority <span class="Italic">must</span> employ such a remedy as a matter of law, but in such a case it would surely bear the burden of explaining why it did not choose to make the employees whole....</p>
<p class="noindent">Applying the analysis of the D.C. Circuit's ruling in the 1990 <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> decision, FLRA emphasized the need for flexibility between prospective and retroactive bargaining orders in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 38 FLRA 989, 992-93 (1990), involving failure to bargain over impact prior to relocation of a regional office:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We...agree with the Judge's recommendation of a prospective bargaining remedy. As noted by the Judge, the matter of retroactive bargaining orders, as discussed in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, was then pending on a petition for rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span>. The court's decision <span class="Italic">en banc</span> subsequently was issued in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>). The court found, as relevant here, that the Authority has broad discretion to fashion appropriate remedies for unfair labor practices and, with regard to retroactive bargaining orders, the Authority is empowered under section 7118(a)(7) of the Statute to order parties to bargain without also requiring that whatever agreement is reached be given retroactive effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we conclude that a prospective bargaining order is appropriate to remedy the Respondent's violation of the Statute. The record establishes that the parties bargained, to some extent, and reached agreement over various proposals and counterproposals that were offered. As to matters concerning which the parties have not bargained, our remedy would not preclude the parties from giving retroactive effect to any agreement reached. In addition, a prospective bargaining order provides the parties with the flexibility to determine whether, and with regard to which matters, retroactivity best meets their needs. With respect to the latter point, we note that the parties agreed to bargain after the relocation and that additional impact matters affecting bargaining unit employees may have arisen since that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that a prospective bargaining order is appropriate in this case, we nevertheless take this opportunity to address the Judge's statement that, in the Authority's view, "mandatory retroactivity is generally detrimental to the bargaining process." Contrary to the Judge's view, we find nothing in previous Authority decisions holding that, as a <span id="page_1632"></span>general matter, retroactive bargaining orders are undesirable. Moreover, to the extent that previous Authority decisions have imposed retroactive bargaining orders in certain categories of cases only, those decisions should not be read as indicating that retroactive bargaining orders may not be appropriate in other cases. It is clear, in this regard, that "Congress quite directly entrusted the Authority, with the responsibility to 'take any remedial action it considers appropriate to carry out the policies'" of the Statute. <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 910 F.2d at 968 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). Consistent with this responsibility, we will continue to examine, and fashion, remedies in individual cases, including retroactive bargaining orders, appropriate to effectuate the policies and purposes of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Mediterranean Region, Madrid, Spain</span>, 38 FLRA No. 66 (1990), slip op. at 5 (Authority ordered "retroactive application where possible in order to fully remedy [respondent's] unlawful activity.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 40 FLRA 775, 784-85 (1991), considering the remedy when an agency erroneously refused to bargain with a union, offered:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has requested that the Respondent be ordered to retroactively bargain regarding all changes in working conditions since certification.&#x2003;Taking into account the totality of the circumstances, we believe that a prospective bargaining order is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), the court found, as relevant here, that the Authority has broad discretion to fashion appropriate remedies for unfair labor practices. Specifically, the court held that there is nothing in the language of the Statute that restricts the Authority's discretion to determine whether and when to direct retroactive bargaining orders as a remedy for an agency's refusal to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the past, the Authority has imposed retroactive bargaining orders in certain defined situations. For example, such a remedy is appropriate where there has been a refusal to bargain over a specific proposal that had previously been held by the Authority to be within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 21 FLRA 797, 790 (1986). The Authority has also ordered an agency to incorporate into the parties' collective bargaining agreement the specific terms of an interest-arbitration award retroactively to the date the award became final and binding. Further, we have ordered retroactive bargaining orders in cases involving refusals to bargain over negotiable proposals....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although these examples do not exhaust the type of cases in which retroactive bargaining orders would be appropriate, we believe that a prospective bargaining order would promote an effective relationship between the parties in this case, which involves a new bargaining relationship. The Union has requested bargaining for an initial agreement. Thus, all issues remain open to the parties during negotiations. Indeed, the Union had offered no substantive proposals with its requests to negotiate, except for a dues withholding procedure. In these circumstances, we find that a prospective bargaining order will provide the parties in this new relationship with the flexibility to determine what will best serve their needs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in the circumstances of this case, we conclude that a prospective bargaining order will best effectuate the policies and purposes of the Statute. We emphasize, however, that our remedy will not preclude the parties from giving retroactive effect to any agreement reached, on any matter....</p>
