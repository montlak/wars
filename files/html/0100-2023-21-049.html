<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-49"><span class="space">c.</span> Technical Constructions Concerning Filing Date: Method of Filing; Filing With Former Agency</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The one year deadline is strictly construed, <span class="Italic">Cooley v. OPM</span>, 50 MSPR 306, 309 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, OPM has no discretion to waive a substantive statutory requirement, <span class="Italic">see Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 267, 272 (1981), and this principle applies to statutory filing deadlines that contain no waiver provisions, <span class="Italic">see Ader v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 448, 450 (1985). The Board accordingly held, in a case involving a competent applicant for disability benefits, that the administrative judge had no discretion to waive the time limit of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). <span class="Italic">Glaspell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. 375, 376 (1984). As the agency correctly points out, section 8337(b) contains no language providing for the waiver of the one-year time limit applicable to filings made by a fiduciary on behalf of a mentally incompetent person. The administrative judge therefore erred in applying precedent relating to untimely petitions for appeal and petitions for review filed with the Board, since the regulations construed in those cases, 5 C.F.R, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.22(c) and 1201.114(f), expressly provide for waiver of the time limits for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 173, 175-78 (1991) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM,</span> 974 F.2d 164 (Fed. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>), honored the OPM interpretation of the filing requirement as the date of receipt of the disability annuity application by OPM rather than as the date that the application is postmarked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), a claim for a disability retirement annuity may be allowed "only if the application is filed with the [OPM] before the employee...is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter." The statute further provides that the time limit may be waived if the employee is mentally incompetent on the date of separation from service or within one year thereafter. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM is statutorily charged with administering the civil service retirement system, and prescribing regulations to carry out the provisions of the law under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a). Section 8347(b) further provides that "[a]pplications...shall be in such form as [OPM] prescribes." Pursuant to the regulations which OPM promulgated under this authority, a timely applicant for disability "shall file an application for annuity with OPM before his separation from the service or within 1 year thereafter." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.501(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The above regulation sheds no light on the issue of what constitutes a "filing" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). OPM explained below, however, that it has a "long-standing policy" whereby, it considers the date that it receives a disability retirement application as being the date that the application was "filed," within the meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted, however, that the term "filed," as it pertains to the submission of a disability retirement application, was not defined in either the statute or the regulation. He also noted that OPM's "gloss" on the disability retirement regulations, found in Federal Personnel Manual Supplement, Chapter 831-1, Subchapter S10, likewise referred to the term "filed," without defining what was meant by that term. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 5. He concluded that "[n]either the statute nor OPM's regulations for filing disability retirement applications require[d] that [the appellant] do more [than she did] for her application to be timely filed." This was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM submitted persuasive evidence below to support its assertion that its long-standing policy has been to consider the receipt date as being the date that an application for disability retirement was filed. Specifically, the record contains an unrebutted affidavit by Irving S. Shapiro, Deputy Assistant Director of OPM's Office of Retirement Programs, stating that, "[i]t is OPM's long-standing policy to interpret 'filing' as date of receipt by OPM. <span class="Italic">Compare Dec v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 72, 78 (1991) (OPM presented no evidence or argument supporting its general statement of position). Inasmuch as OPM is the agency charged with the administration of the statute, we have previously held that its interpretation of the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337 is entitled to deference, unless its interpretation is incorrect. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 420, 423 (1985). Here, the appellant has not shown that OPM's long-standing interpretation of the statutory mandate is incorrect.[1] Indeed, the Board has implicitly accepted the validity of OPM's timeliness policy with regard to the filing of disability retirement applications. <span class="Italic">See Bridges v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 290, 291 (1988)] .[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;OPM demonstrated below that it consistently requires, in various regulatory provisions, that submissions be received by a certain date. <span class="Italic">See,</span> e.g., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.109(e)(1), 831.619(b), 831.621(f)(2), and 831.622(a)(3). Congress, moreover, has specifically sanctioned the use of a receipt date for the filing of a submission. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A), which provides that an election for a survivor annuity must be "a signed writing <span class="Italic">received</span> [by OPM] within 2 years after such employee...marries...." (Emphasis supplied.) In addition, OPM explained in its petition for review that applications for disability retirement are usually submitted by the applicants' employing agencies in franked envelopes that bear no postmark. It is, therefore, not unreasonable for OPM to determine the timeliness of applications by the date of receipt. <span class="Italic">Cf. Spaulding v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 57, 62 (1989) (the Board considered the reasonableness of an OPM requirement that the revocation of an alternative form of annuity election be in written form).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note the administrative judge's statement that "[t]here is no evidence that the appellant had any independent knowledge that OPM would look only at the date received in deciding whether to accept her application as timely, or that the appellant received any forms or documents that made that so-called policy known to her." This consideration is unavailing, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the statute at issue, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337, does not require that OPM notify potential disability retirement annuitants of its interpretation of the statutory filing requirements. <span class="Italic">See Speker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). Second, the appellant sought the advice of an attorney in connection with her disability retirement application. She is, therefore, responsible for the errors or omissions of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">E.g., Smith v. Veterans Administration</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 91, 95 (1990). Third, OPM avers that the first page of a packet of forms entitled "Documentation in Support of Disability Retirement Application" provides notice that an "application for disability retirement must be received by the [OPM] within one year after the date of...separation." OPM also avers that the record indicates that the appellant possessed this packet of forms, because she used them to file her application for disability retirement. Further, inasmuch as the appellant signed her application on October 27, 1989, OPM asserts that she was apprised of its filing requirement at least two weeks prior to the November 13, 1989 deadline for receipt by OPM. The appellant, who is the party bearing the burden of proving her entitlement to the benefit she seeks, <span class="Italic">Speker</span> at 384<span class="Italic">,</span> has not disputed OPM's contention, or alleged that she failed to receive the pertinent cover page to the packet of application forms. There is, therefore, no basis for a finding that the appellant was not timely informed of OPM's filing policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that the administrative judge placed undue importance upon the undisputed fact that the appellant was misled by her employing agency, which advised her that her disability retirement application would be timely if postmarked within the year following her separation. As a rule, the government may not be estopped from denying monetary benefits not otherwise permitted by law, even if the appellant was denied those benefits because of her reliance upon the erroneous statements of its agents. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 110 S. Ct. 2465, 2476 (1990)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reversed the Board's result in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM,</span> 974 F.2d 164 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984), the Supreme Court said, "If Congress has explicitly left a gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the <span id="Page_4156"></span>agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation." If it exercises this authority, "considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 844; <span class="Italic">see also Udall v. Tallman,</span> 380 U.S. 1, 16 (1965). Thus, by enacting regulations, departments and agencies inform the public of their statutory interpretations, and the cases counseling deference recognize these efforts at putting a "gloss" on statutes by regulation or by interpretive activities on the public record. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chevron,</span> 467 U.S. 837; <span class="Italic">Udall,</span> 380 U.S. at 4 ("the Secretary has consistently construed both orders not to bar oil and gas leases; moreover, this interpretation has been made a repeated matter of public record"); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 938 F.2d 1283, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">True v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 926 F.2d 1151, 1154 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital,</span> 488 U.S. 204, 212 (1988), contrasted established agency interpretations to which deference is due with post-hoc rationalizations of agency actions to which deference is not due. "We have never applied the <span class="Italic">[Chevron</span> principle] to agency litigating positions that are wholly unsupported by regulations, rulings, or administrative practice." And, further, "Deference to what appears to be nothing more than an agency's convenient litigating position would be entirely inappropriate."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 213. That in <span class="Italic">Bowen</span> it was appellate counsel rationalizing an agency action, while here it is a line official who is trying to justify OPM's position is a distinction without a difference. The same result obtains: post-hoc rationalizations will not create a statutory interpretation deserving of deference. The board's reliance on the conclusory, unsubstantiated affidavit produced for this case is misplaced. It is insufficient to establish the existence of a regular, long-honored policy of public record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's argument that it consistently requires that applications be received within one year is also deflated by inconsistent regulations. Some require that applications be received within a deadline, <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(1) (1992) ("A request for reconsideration must be received by OPM within 30 calendar days from the date of the original decision"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 831.621(f)(2) ("Any modification...must be in writing and received in OPM no later than the date provided for applications"), while others merely require that an application be postmarked within a deadline, <span class="Italic">e.g., id.</span> &#x00A7; 831.1304(b) ("a request for reconsideration...must be postmarked within 30 calendar days). Of course, these provisions do not pertain to Parker's application, but they illustrate the absence of uniformity in filing requirements. Thus the board was off the mark when it said that OPM "consistently requires in various regulatory provisions that submissions be received by OPM by a certain date." 52 M.S.P.R. at n.1. The cited regulations also show that OPM can readily communicate to the public how it defines a deadline. We, of course, imply no criticism of the inconsistent provisions. But the lack of uniformity makes it essential that the requirements of each regulation be set out explicitly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not quarrel with the board's observation that "Congress...has specifically sanctioned the use of a receipt date for the filing of a submission. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A), which provides that an election for a survivor annuity must be 'a signed writing <span class="Italic">received</span> [by OPM] within 2 years after such employee...marries....'" 52 M.S.P.R. at n.1. This illustrates the value of saying explicitly what is required. But it does not help in interpreting what Congress meant when it merely used the ambiguous word "file," and it is entirely irrelevant to the question of whether OPM has a long-standing policy of interpreting "filed" to mean "received" under section 8337(b). In the face of the perfunctory affidavit attesting to an alleged "long-standing policy," the front page of the forms packet Parker was given, which, of course, is not a regulation, stated, "Your application for disability retirement must be received by [OPM] within one year after the date of your separation. (see item 5 under 'Eligibility')." But the referenced item 5 says, "You...must apply...within one year." At the same time the personnel office informed Parker that she need only have her application postmarked within one year. Apparently, even among personnelists there was disagreement about the requirement. With the statute and the regulation inscrutable, the forms and the verbal instructions inconsistent, and the alleged practice of OPM unknown, Parker's prompt mailing was sufficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Felzien v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 930 F.2d 898 (Fed. Cir. 1991), we declined to credit OPM's regulation which merely parroted the language of the statute it implemented. At issue there was a law providing for an enhanced annuity to those who qualified as "firefighters," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21) (1988), which defined a firefighter as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily to perform work directly connected with [1] the control and extinguishment of fires <span class="Italic">or</span> [2] the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added). OPM's implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 (1990), was identical to the statute, also using the disjunctive "or." But, in practice, OPM ignored the "or" and required an employee to meet parts [1] <span class="Italic">and</span> [2] . Because the regulation was "an almost verbatim reproduction of the definition set by Congress" instead of an interpretation of that statute, the cases counseling deference to regulations were not pertinent to our analysis. 930 F.2d at 902. In those cases "each regulation interpreted a statute by either supplying an omission or resolving an ambiguity."<span class="Italic">Id.; see McLean v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 800 F.2d 254, 255 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 782 F.2d 993, 994 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We concluded,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We are aware of no OPM rule or regulation, of long standing or otherwise, which specifies that communications officers like Felzien are not "firefighters." That OPM previously has denied firefighter credit to employees filling the positions of electronic technicians, aircraft mechanics, retardant mixers, warehousemen, dispatchers, crash truck mechanics, and fire inspectors does not amount to a statutory interpretation that persons like Felzien also cannot qualify....&#8197;Stripped of its armor of undue deference, OPM merely invites us to defer to its decision in this particular case. We decline the invitation. The law prevents us from abdicating review, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c), and we would not in any event embrace a principle that rendered our role superfluous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Felzien,</span> 930 F.2d at 902. Likewise here, OPM's regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.501(a) &#x0026; (c), ("must submit" and "shall file") parallels the language of section 8337(b) ("filed"); it offers no interpretive guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not a case of government estoppel foreclosed by <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414 (1990). We do not suggest that the government is estopped because Parker relied on erroneous advice from a government employee. What we do suggest, indeed hold, is that Congress used a word, "filed," which admits of at least two constructions: Parker's "postmarked," and OPM's "received." Because we conclude that OPM has not properly or publicly announced its construction, Parker cannot be penalized so long as she meets the statute, which she has. Put otherwise, until OPM properly and fully sets out its interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), an applicant will meet the statute by either lodging her papers with OPM within one year, or displaying a postmark proving they were mailed within one year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of meaningful guidance, substantial evidence of a consistent policy, either internally applied or publicly announced, and in accordance with our prescription in <span class="Italic">Felzien,</span> that, "A nonexistent interpretation obviously cannot be one of long standing," 930 F.2d at 902, we do not defer to OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilburn v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 19, 21-23 (1993), concluded that if the disability retirement application is filed with the employing agency while the applicant is still employed, it is deemed constructively received by OPM on the date of filing with the employing agency if that is within the one-year filing period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips</span> specifically declined to decide whether material in the FPM made an employing agency OPM's agent for collecting and processing an application filed before the thirty-first day after the applicant's separation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 529 n. For the reasons stated in the initial decision in this appeal, we find that the appellant established that she filed her application with her employing agency while she was still an employee. Thus, the holding in <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips</span> is not dispositive of the question of the timeliness of the appellant's application for disability retirement benefits. Because of the differences in the guidance provided by the FPM regarding these two classes of applicants, the Board, as explained below, finds that a disability retirement application filed by a current employee with her employing agency has been constructively filed with OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the majority observed in <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips,</span> the FPM provides that an employee who has been separated for at least thirty-one days should send her application directly to OPM, and that the application must be received by OPM within one year after the date of separation. By contrast, the FPM states that applications for disability retirement filed by those who are still Federal employees "<span class="Italic">must</span> be submitted through the [employing] agency."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 533 (quoting FPM Supp. 831-1, Subch. S10-1(e) (1983)) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the FPM in effect in 1980, when the appellant filed her application for disability retirement, did not expressly state this rule, it did provide that, when an application was filed through the employing agency, the agency should forward it to the Civil Service Commission [OPM's predecessor agency] "as soon as possible," and that, "If the employee has been separated more than 30 days, he or she <span class="Italic">may</span> submit an application directly to the Civil Service Commission, without routing it through the former employing agency." FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S10-8 (1978) (emphasis added). It logically follows that a current employee was required to submit his or her application to the employing agency, as the FPM now expressly provides. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that nothing in the 1983 amendments to the FPM, which promulgated the present wording of the FPM, suggests that the current, mandatory language involved any change from previous practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Letter 831-78 (June 23, 1983); <span class="Italic">See Farrell v. Department of Justice,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 504, <span id="Page_4157"></span>511, 512 (1991) (although the FPM in effect at the time was silent on the issue in question, later additions to the FPM were persuasive evidence of the proper interpretation of statutory and regulatory provisions governing restoration rights). Wilburn, unlike Stevenson-Phillips, was thus subject to the unambiguous instructions of the FPM to file through her employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FPM provisions making it mandatory for current employees to file through the employing agencies empowers those agencies to act for OPM in receiving the applications, and makes the submission of the applications to them constructive filing with OPM. An appropriate analogy for interpreting OPM's guidance in the FPM is to the rule of statutory construction that courts should assume Congress intends the words it uses to have their ordinary meaning "when it has given no clue to its intentions except familiar English words and no hint by the draftsmen of the words that they meant to use them in any but an ordinary sense."<span class="Italic">Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products,</span> 322 U.S. 607, 618 (1944); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. Burnes,</span> 816 F.2d 1354, 1359 (9th Cir. 1987) (courts must give effect to the plain meaning of the language used). An agency should similarly not be able to invoke unexpressed limitations to change the plain meaning of its issuances. <span class="Italic">Cf. Howell v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 785 F.2d 282, 283-85 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (whatever the Board's intentions, the wording of its order extended the finality date of the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's guidance states that applications from current employees must be submitted through their employing agencies without including any caveat stating that the application's submission to the agency does not satisfy the statutory filing requirement. In the absence of such qualifying language, the Board finds that the effect of OPM's guidance is to direct filing with the employing agency as the method of filing with OPM for purposes of the statute. The guidance in the FPM thus makes the employing agency OPM's instrument or agent (in the dictionary sense) for purposes of receiving the application. Because the appellant established that she submitted her application to her employing agency within the one-year filing period, her application was therefore timely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Elendu v. OPM</span>, 108 MSPR 1, 5 &#x00B6; 11, 2008 MSPB 12 (2008) (fax filing with the employing agency was timely, as measured by the date on the fax).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Current OPM regulations permit a timely filing of a disability annuity application by a former employee if the form is filed with the agency, rather than OPM, within a year from the employee's separation. <span class="Italic">Brickhouse v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 518, 521-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, 2009 MSPB 115 (2009), stated the regulatory change:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the plain language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(1) as it existed in 1992, the appellant's application for a FERS disability retirement in this case would have been untimely filed. On April 8, 1998, however, OPM revised its regulations governing the timely application for disability retirement. Among other things, the revised regulations were intended to "establish standards for determining the date on which an application for disability retirement has been filed." Revised Application Procedures for Disability Retirement Under CSRS and FERS, 63 Fed. Reg. 17,049 (1998) (codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1203-.1204, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201); <span class="Italic">see Hall v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 3 (1999). OPM adopted several recommendations made by commenters on the proposed revised regulations, including provisions "to meet the regulations' intent of allowing former employees to file applications for disability retirement with their former employing agencies within one year of separation," and "to ensure that procedures for determining the date on which a disability retirement application is filed apply equally in all filing situations." 63 Fed. Reg. 17,089. The regulations for both CSRS and FERS disability retirement applications were revised accordingly, and the FERS regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a) took its current form at the time. The court's decision<span class="Italic"> Deerinwater</span> thus construes a now outdated regulatory provision and its reasoning does not support the conclusions of law in the ID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The current OPM regulation states, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM, an employing agency or former employing agency by personal delivery is considered filed on the date on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency receives it....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM or the applicant's former employing agency within 1 year after the employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed or submitted in a letter or other form not prescribed by OPM, is deemed timely filed. OPM will not adjudicate the application or make payment until the application is filed on a form prescribed by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(2), (3); <span class="Italic">see also Hall,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the undisputed facts of this case, the appellant falls within the group of FERS disability retirement applicants covered by these subsections. The record shows that he filed his FERS disability retirement application with his former employing agency on November 21, 2007, which is less than a year after his separation date of November 24, 2006. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(2), his application is considered filed on the day it was received by his former employing agency. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(3), the appellant's application filed with his former employing agency within one year after his separation is deemed timely filed, even though his former employing agency had to await receipt of his official personnel file prior to forwarding the completed application to OPM for adjudication. Therefore, we find that the appellant timely filed his application for a FERS disability retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201 (a)(2), (3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Previously, to meet the time limit for filing a disability annuity application, if the employee has been separated for more than 31 days, the application should go to OPM.
