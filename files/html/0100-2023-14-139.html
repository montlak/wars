<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-140"><span class="space">2.</span> Required Documentation; Verification</h4>
<p class="noindent">A union could compel negotiations on a proposal that required medical documentation for sick leave only if a pattern of abuse was suspected or existed. The late FPM did not mandate any particular documentation requirements. Agency regulations prescribing documentation of absences exceeding three days were not shown to be supported by a compelling need. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3488 and FDIC</span>, 12 FLRA 532, 537 (1983). Nothing precluded negotiations of proposals describing when management would or would not require a written application (SF-71) or medical certificate to support the use of sick leave. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 31 FLRA 360, 375 (1988) (Proposal 4).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1380 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Coastal Sys. Ctr., Panama City</span>, 36 FLRA 725, 737, 740-41 (1990), denied the negotiability of Provision 3: "In no event shall the employee be required to furnish information not required on Standard Form 71, or be required to elaborate in the remarks column when the attending physician has certified that the employee has been under his/her professional care." The proposal was nonnegotiable because it interfered with management's right to discipline:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The right to hold employees accountable for work-related conduct...encompasses the right to require employees to account for their use of sick leave....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under applicable...OPM regulations, an employee may be excused from work with pay when the employee (1) receives medical, dental or optical examination or treatment; (2) is incapacitated for duty because of sickness, injury or pregnancy and confinement; (3) is required to give care and attendance to an immediate family member afflicted with a contagious disease; or (4) has been exposed to a contagious disease. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.401. An employee's request for sick leave, however, must be supported by "administratively acceptable" evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 640.403. An agency may determine that an employee's certification of the reasons for his or her absence constitutes administratively acceptable evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency may also require, for an absence in excess of 3 workdays, or for a lesser period when the agency determines it to be necessary, that the employee provide a medical certificate "or other administratively acceptable evidence as to the reason for the absence." <span class="Italic">Id. See also</span> Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 990-2, Subchapter S4-2-b.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, nothing in OPM regulations limits an agency's right to require evidence in support of a request for sick leave beyond that provided on an SF71. Under those regulations, an agency may, but need not, accept an employee's SF71 as sufficient evidence of a reason to grant sick leave....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency may properly conclude that a medical certificate is insufficient to establish that an employee was incapacitated by illness justifying the employee's absence from work.... By limiting management's inquiries as to an employee's use of sick leave to the information contained on the SF71, Provision 3 restricts management's right to hold employees accountable for the use of sick leave. Accordingly, we find that Provision 3...interferes with management's rights...to...discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">NAIL Local 7 and Dept. of Air Force, Seymour Johnson AFB</span>, 67 FLRA 654, 655-58 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring in part and dissenting in part), was Provision 2, FLRA first explaining the meaning, as modified by the union's position statement, and then the negotiability of the provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sick leave of more than three consecutive workdays should be supported by a medical certificate.&#x2003;When for justifiable reasons a medical certificate is unnecessary, the Employer may accept an employee's certificate showing incapacitation waiving medical documentation. The certificate, when required, must cover all absence beyond the third workday and show that the employee was incapacitated for duty for the entire period covered by the certificate. In cases of extended illness, medical certificates may be required periodically if necessary to establish the employee's continued incapacity to return to duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Meaning</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the parties do not dispute the meaning of a provision, and that meaning is consistent with the provision's wording, then the Authority bases its negotiability determination on the undisputed meaning.[10] In addition, where a proposal or provision is ambiguous or silent as to a particular matter, but the parties agree on that aspect of the proposal or provision's meaning, the Authority will adopt the agreed-upon meaning so long as it is consistent with the proposal or provision's wording.[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the parties disagree--in part--over the meaning of the first two sentences of Provision 1. As the parties do not reference the remaining sentences of the provision, neither do we.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where parties disagree over the meaning of a proposal or provision, the Authority looks to its plain wording and any union statement of intent.[12] If the union's explanation is consistent with the provision's plain wording, then the Authority adopts that explanation for the purpose of assessing the provision's legality.[13] For example, where a union explained that a provision stating that an agency "may" issue a written warning would permit--but not require--the agency to issue a written warning in certain circumstances, the Authority adopted the union's explanation as consistent with the provision's wording.[14] We note that the meaning that the Authority adopts in resolving a negotiability dispute applies in other proceedings--including arbitration--unless modified by the parties through subsequent agreement.[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_712"></span>The first sentence of Provision 1 states that "[s]ick leave of <span class="Italic">more than three</span> consecutive workdays should be supported by a medical certificate." The parties disagree over the extent to which the provision's first sentence limits the Agency's ability to require medical certification to support sick-leave requests of three or fewer workdays. Specifically, the Agency claims that this sentence would prohibit the Agency from requiring medical certification to support any request for three or fewer days of sick leave. The Union, on the other hand, asserts that Provision 1 should be read in the context of the sick-leave-abuse provision of the parties' agreement, under which the Agency may place any employee it suspects of sick-leave abuse on sick-leave restriction and require that employee to provide medical certification to support sick-leave requests of any duration. Thus, the Union asserts that, under the first sentence of Provision 1, "an employee on sick leave for three days or less will not be required to provide [medical] documentation, <span class="Italic">unless</span> the employee" is on sick-leave restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 is silent as to sick-leave requests for three or fewer days. As both parties interpret the first sentence of Provision 1 as precluding the Agency from requiring an employee <span class="Italic">who is not on sick-leave restriction</span> to provide medical certification for requests of three or fewer days of sick leave, we adopt that meaning for determining the negotiability of Provision 1. However, to the extent that the Agency argues that Provision 1 would prevent the Agency from requiring an employee <span class="Italic">who is on sick-leave restriction</span> to provide medical certification to support requests for three or fewer days of sick leave, that argument is inconsistent with the Union's explanation of the meaning and operation of the provision. In particular, the Union clarified at the conference that "the Agency may request that any employee suspected of abusing sick leave...submit medical certification" to support a sick-leave request of any duration. Because the Union's explanation of the provision's meaning is consistent with the provision's plain wording, we adopt that meaning. Thus, we interpret Provision 1 as permitting the Agency to require medical certification to support any sick-leave request (of any duration) from an employee on sick-leave restriction. That is, the first sentence would preclude the Agency from requiring medical certification to support requests for three or fewer days of sick leave only from employees who are not on sick-leave restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties also dispute the meaning of the second sentence of Provision 1, which pertains to requests for more than three days of sick leave, and which provides that the Agency "<span class="Italic">may</span> accept" an employee's self-certification in lieu of medical certification "[w]hen[,] for justifiable reasons[,] a medical certificate is unnecessary." Specifically, although the parties agree that this sentence would <span class="Italic">permit</span> the Agency to accept an employee's self-certification to support a sick-leave request of more than three days, the Agency also asserts that this sentence would <span class="Italic">require</span> the Agency to accept a self-certification whenever an employee asserts a "justifiable reason."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union clarified at the conference that, under the second sentence of Provision 1, the Agency would retain "the discretion to determine whether to accept or reject" an employee's self-certification for a sick-leave request for more than three days. Thus, in the event that the Agency rejected the employee's self-certification, the Agency would retain the ability to require medical certification to support a sick-leave request for more than three days. As the Union's explanation is consistent with the plain wording of the provision--specifically, that the Agency "may accept" an employee's self-certification--we interpret Provision 1 as permitting the Agency to accept or reject an employee's self-certification to support a sick-leave request for more than three days.[32]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In sum, under the first sentence of Provision 1, the Agency would be required to accept an employee's self-certification in support of a sick-leave request for three or fewer days unless the employee is on sick-leave restriction. Under the second sentence, the Agency would be permitted, but not required, to accept an employee's self-certification for a sick-leave request of more than three days. The Agency would be permitted to require medical certification for a sick-leave request of any duration from an employee who is on sick-leave restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency has not established that Provision 1 conflicts with a government-wide regulation.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If parties reach an agreement that is contrary to the Statute or "any other applicable law, rule, or regulation," then the head of the agency may disapprove it under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) of the Statute.[33] Thus, an agency may properly disapprove of a provision that is inconsistent with an applicable "[g]overnment-wide...regulation" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.[34] And regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that apply generally to civilian employees of the federal government are government-wide regulations within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1).[35] Here, the OPM regulation cited by the Agency--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.405(a)--provides that an agency may grant a sick-leave request only when supported by "administratively acceptable evidence."[36] The regulation further provides that an agency "may...require a medical certificate...for an absence in excess of [three] workdays, or for a lesser period when the agency determines it is necessary."[37] However, the regulation also states that an agency "may consider an employee's self-certification as to the reason for his or her absence as administratively acceptable evidence, regardless of the duration of the absence."[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We note that, previously, the wording of &#x00A7; 630.405 was contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.403.[39] However, the renumbering did not change the wording. Accordingly, Authority precedent interpreting the wording at both locations is relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it has a right to require medical certification for absences of three or fewer days under &#x00A7; 630.405(a). Consistent with the meaning we adopt above, the first sentence of Provision 1 prohibits the Agency from exercising this alleged right unless the Agency has placed the employee on sick-leave restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted and relevant here, under &#x00A7; 630.405(a), an agency "may" require medical certification for a sick-leave request for three or fewer days. The question here is whether an agency has the authority to contractually agree to accept something other than medical certification without running afoul of the regulation. In this regard, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that lawmakers' use of "the word 'may'...usually implies some degree of discretion."[44]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44] <span class="Italic">United States v. Rodgers</span>, 461 U.S. 677, 706 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also Haig v.

Cl. 2005) ("strong presumption that 'may' is permissive and discretionary, and not mandatory").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with OPM's use of the word "may" in &#x00A7; 630.405(a), the Authority has interpreted the regulation as permissive and discretionary. In <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2052 (Local 2052)</span>,[46] the Authority held that a proposal that prohibited an agency from requiring anything other than self-certification to support an employee's sick-leave request did not conflict with the regulation.[47] Specifically, the Authority emphasized that the regulation permits an agency to accept self-certification as "administratively acceptable evidence" for any absence regardless of duration, and permits--but does not require--the agency to request additional evidence.[48] Thus, the Authority reasoned that a proposal requiring an agency to exercise its discretion <span class="Italic">not</span> to require anything more than self-certification to support a sick-leave request was consistent with the regulation.[49]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia (Navy)</span>,[50] an arbitrator enforced a contract provision that required an agency to accept self-certification in certain circumstances, such as where an employee had a recurring illness.[51] Denying an agency-filed exception to the award, the Authority found that the arbitrator's enforcement of that provision did not conflict with the regulation.[52] Thus, the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Local 2052</span> and <span class="Italic">Navy</span> support a conclusion that the Agency's discretion to require a medical certificate may be the subject of collective bargaining.[53]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency cites the Authority's statement in <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1380 (Local 1380)</span>,[54] that "nothing in OPM regulations limits an agency's right to require evidence in support of a request for sick leave" beyond self-certification.[55] However, the Authority made that statement in response to a union argument that management's right to hold employees accountable for their sick-leave use under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute did not extend beyond self-certification.[56] And the issue of whether the provision conflicted with &#x00A7; 630.405(a) was not before the Authority in that case. Thus, <span class="Italic">Local 1380</span> is inapposite.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[56] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 740-41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, &#x00A7; 630.405(a) authorizes the Agency to accept self-certification to support sick leave of any duration, and does not compel the Agency to require medical certification in any circumstance. Accordingly, we find that the first sentence of Provision 1 is consistent with the discretion conferred on the Agency by &#x00A7; 630.405(a).[58]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[58] <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 1105; <span class="Italic">Local 2052</span>, 30 FLRA at 840-41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the second sentence of Provision 1, which concerns sick-leave requests of more than three days, conflicts with &#x00A7; 630.405(a) because the sentence would <span class="Italic">require</span> the Agency to "waive its right to request medical certification in the face of a 'justifiable reason' from an employee." However, consistent with the meaning we adopt above, the second sentence would permit--<span class="Italic">but not require</span>--the Agency to accept self-certification to support requests for more than three days of sick leave. Thus, the Agency's argument provides no basis for finding that the second sentence of Provision 1 conflicts with &#x00A7; 630.405(a).[60]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1277-78 (1997) (rejecting agency's negotiability arguments that were based on misinterpretation of meaning and operation of provision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of its argument that Provision 1 is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 630.405(a), the Agency also asserts that "[s]ick[-]leave restriction is considered a prelude to formal discipline and is not within the scope of...&#x00A7; 630.405(a)." But the Agency does not explain--and we do not understand--how a claim that sick-leave restriction is not a part of &#x00A7; 630.405(a) supports an argument that the Provision 1 is inconsistent with the same section. And although the Agency states that "[d]isciplinary and adverse actions are covered in 5 C.F.R. [p]art 752," the Agency does not claim that Provision 1 conflicts with those regulations. Accordingly, we reject these arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Agency has not established that Provision 1 conflicts with a government-wide regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-82 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Exch., Naval Air Station, Jacksonville</span>, 43 FLRA 25, 26-28 (1991), resolved as nonnegotiable Provision 1, involving a demand that the agency first orally warn an employee that a doctor's certificate may be required for subsequent absence due to sick leave. Then, if there was no improvement, the agency would be required to advise the employee in writing that all future requests for sick leave must be supported by a doctor's certificate. The effect of the proposal was to require warnings before the agency could place the employee on sick leave restriction and require medical documentation. Because the use of leave restriction was a practical precondition of an agency decision to discipline an employee for misuse of leave, the proposal interfered with management's right to discipline employees. The appropriate arrangements test was not invoked by the union as to Provision 1, but another proposal, Provision 2, called on FLRA to consider, as an arrangement, requirements that (a) the employer refrain from calling a physician regarding the reason for absence, and (b) after the employer has been notified of an employee's illness the employer not call the employee's residence for verification of the illness. Both proposals interfered with management's right to discipline. The preclusion against calls to employees' homes, based on the reasoning in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Petersburg</span>, 30 FLRA 837, 843-44 (1987) (Proposal 2), unduly interfered with management's right to discipline. The second proposal in <span class="Italic">NAGE R5-82</span>, precluding calls to physicians, was a negotiable arrangement. The employer was not precluded from obtaining information through personal or written contact with doctors. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 719 (1992), rejected the negotiability of Provision 9, obliging management to exercise in a "fair and objective" manner its right to require medical certification supporting sick leave. The proposal interfered with management's right to impose discipline. The proposal was not advanced as an appropriate arrangement.</p>
