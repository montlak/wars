<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-315"><span class="space">l.</span> Military Leave; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span></span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">One type of USERRA MSPB case involves past denial of military leave. That appeal generally follows the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. DOJ</span>, <span id="Page_549"></span>336 F.3d 1332, 1333-43 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Judge Bryson dissenting), providing legislative analysis to determine how "days" are counted for purposes of a statutory 15-day allotment of military leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kelly Butterbaugh, Roseanne T. Faltin, John C. Marderness, and Robert J. Bono ("Petitioners") appeal the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"), which held that Petitioners' employer, the Department of Justice ("Department" or "agency"), acted permissibly in charging Petitioners' military leave allowance for days on which they were not scheduled to work, but they spent training with the military reserves. <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 490 (2002). The Board concluded that the "15 days" of paid reserve training leave granted by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1) refers to 15 calendar days of military training, not to 15 workdays. We conclude, based on the text of the statute, that federal employees need take military leave only for those days on which they are required to work, and that section 6323(a)(1) thereby grants up to 15 workdays of military leave. We therefore reverse the decision of the Board and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners are full-time employees of the Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, at the Federal Correctional Institution in Loretto, Pennsylvania. Petitioners are also members of the military reserves. Like other reservists, Petitioners are required to attend military training sessions each year. By statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1) (2000), federal employees are granted up to "15 days" of paid leave to attend reserve or National Guard[1] training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We use the terms "reservist" and "reserve training" to encompass National Guard members and obligations as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to 2000, the Department, as other federal agencies had done for decades, had included days on which employees were not scheduled to work (e.g., weekends and holidays) when calculating how much military leave employees took. For example, an employee (with a Monday-Friday workweek) attending reserve training from one Friday through the next would be charged for eight days of military leave, even though the employee was absent for only six workdays. Thus, the agency measured the grant of military leave by the number of calendar days employees spent in reserve training, rather than by the number of workdays on which they were absent from work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At least in part due to this accounting practice, Petitioners complain that they were forced to supplement their statutory military leave with other leave time to meet their reserve training obligations. Petitioners assert that they took annual leave or leave without pay in order to serve the full period of their reserve training.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The limited record before us indicates that petitioner Bono requested and was granted leave without pay to attend reserve duty. The record does not indicate whether other Petitioners used annual leave or leave without pay to fulfill their reserve training requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2000, Congress amended section 6323 to add subsection (a)(3), which states: "The minimum charge for leave under this subsection is one hour, and additional charges are in multiples thereof." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(3) (2000). Although neither the amendment nor any legislative history accompanying the amendment addressed or altered the grant of "15 days" of leave in section 6323(a)(1), the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") determined that, in light of the new subsection, section 6323(a)(1) could no longer be interpreted to charge non-workdays against federal employees' military leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Based on new section 6323(a)(3), it is clear that Congress recognizes an 8-hour civilian workday as the basis for accruing 1 day of military leave and that there is no intent to charge an employee military leave for the hours that he or she would not otherwise work.... Members of the Reserves and/or National Guard will no longer be charged military leave for non-duty days (typically weekends and holidays) that occur within the period of military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Memorandum for Human Resources Directors, Office of Personnel Management (Jan. 25, 2001). The Department, like other federal agencies, changed its military leave policy to conform to OPM's new interpretation. Thus, Petitioners' grievances relate to past and not current agency policies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners filed complaints with the Board, alleging that the agency's pre-2000 practice of charging their military leave for non-workdays, and thereby forcing them to use other leave to complete reserve training, violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333 (2000), by denying them a benefit of employment based on their military service. In an Initial Decision, the Board's administrative judge ruled that (1) the Board lacked jurisdiction over Petitioners' claim, because the agency had actually granted them their military leave and therefore their appeal did not allege the denial of a benefit of employment under USERRA; and (2) if the Board had jurisdiction, the agency had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its leave policy, because the agency was merely following OPM's guidance in charging non-workdays against military leave. <span class="Italic">Faltin v. Dep't of Justice,</span> Nos. PH3443010135-I-1, -0134-I-1, -0136-I-1, -0137-I-1 (Merit Sys. Prot. Bd. Apr. 24, 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners sought review of the administrative judge's initial decision by the full Board. Contrary to the administrative judge, the full Board determined that it had jurisdiction over the appeal, because Petitioners had made a nonfrivolous allegation under USERRA that they had been denied a benefit of employment due to their reserve service. <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. at 494-95. However, the Board ruled that the Department's practice of charging non-workdays against military leave did not deprive Petitioners of a benefit of employment because, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Board held that the grant of "15 days" of leave in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a) meant 15 calendar days of leave, not 15 workdays. Hence, agencies were properly charging Petitioners for all days they spent in military training, whether or not those days were workdays. The Board reached this conclusion beginning with the observation that the ordinary and accustomed meaning of "day" is a calendar day, indicating that section 6323(a)(1) grants calendar days of leave. Further, for purposes of subchapter I of title 5, chapter 63, Congress specifically defined "day" to be a workday, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6302(a), but did not do so for subchapter II. This suggested to the Board that Congress did not intend for "day" to mean workday in subchapter II, where section 6323(a) is found. Moreover, Congress specifically used "workdays" in the sections of the statute granting extended active duty leave for reservists (sections (b)(1) and (d)(1) of section 6323), showing that Congress knew how to specify workdays when it chose to.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board extensively reviewed the history of the leave statutes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Before 1899, full-time civilian federal employees were generally charged annual and sick leave for intervening non-workdays that occurred during a period of leave. The rationale for that policy was apparently twofold: first, that days generally refers to calendar days, including weekends and holidays; and, second, that Congress intended that employees, who were then paid for every day, including weekends and holidays, receive one month's vacation with the time expressed in days because of the varying lengths of the calendar months.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An 1899 act provided, for the first time, that annual leave shall be charged exclusive of non-workdays. That statute did not apply to sick leave and sick leave continued to be charged for intervening non-workdays.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The first statute specifically granting civilian federal employees military leave of up to 15 days a year for training was enacted in 1917. Act of May 12, 1917, ch. 12, 40 Stat. 40 (1917). That statute did not state whether intervening non-workdays during a period of military leave were to be charged as leave, and in the absence of such language, military leave was administered consistent with the pre-1899 policy of charging annual leave and the then-existing policy for charging sick leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In 1951, Congress completed a significant overhaul of the federal leave system and defined "days" for purposes of annual and sick leave as being exclusive of non-workdays. Act of Oct. 30, 1951, Title II, 65 Stat. 679 (1951). As discussed above, however, that definition was only applied to what would become codified as subchapter I of title 63. Thus, for military leave purposes, "days" retained its ordinary meaning that the term had for all types of leave prior to the 1899 statutory change.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Civil Service Commission incorporated the long-standing practice for charging military leave into the Federal Personnel Manual and the record contains a copy of the relevant provision from 1963. When the Civil Service Commission was abolished and the Office of Personnel Management was created pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, the Office of Personnel Management retained the provision, which the Bureau of Prisons incorporated into its leave policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Despite making various changes to the military leave system in the last 40 years, Congress did not address the way military leave was charged until 2000. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.,</span> Pub.L. No. 104-106, 110 Stat. 186 (1996) (authorizing military reserve technicians up to 44 workdays a year to participate in noncombat operations outside of the United States); Pub.L. No. 102-190, 105 Stat. 1290 (1991) (increasing the duties for which reservists are entitled to take military leave from federal employment); Pub.L. No. 96-431, 94 Stat. 1850 (1980) (making military leave available on a fiscal rather than calendar year basis and allowing the limited carrying over of military leave to future years); Pub.L. No. 90-588, 82 Stat. 1151 (1968) (authorizing 22 days paid leave when a reservist or National Guardsman is activated to enforce the law).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Butterbaugh,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. at 497-99 (footnotes, citations, and paragraph numbers omitted). The Board inferred from this history that Congress approved of the way federal agencies had been administering section 6323(a)(1). According to the Board, because Congress is presumed to <span id="Page_550"></span>know of administrative interpretations of a statute when it re-enacts a statute without change, <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons,</span> 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978), Congress would have acted to correct any administrative misinterpretation of section 6323(a)(1) when it revisited the military leave system in 1968, 1980, 1991, and 1996. Given that Congress took no such action until 2000, when it supposedly changed the interpretation of section 6323(a)(1) by adding section 6323(a)(3), the Board concluded that the long-standing practice of charging non-workdays against federal employees' military leave had met with Congress's approval.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners appeal the decision of the Board. We exercise jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the Board's decisions is circumscribed by statute. We must set aside findings or conclusions of the Board that we find to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2000). For purposes of this appeal, neither side contests the Board's determination that Petitioners have alleged denial of a benefit of employment due to their performance of military duties, thereby alleging a USERRA violation by an executive agency actionable to the Board under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Moreover, we agree with the Board that, in contrast to cases such as <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1013-14 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the question in this case is not whether Petitioners' military status was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's action, for agencies only grant military leave to employees who are also military reservists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue, as the Board perceived, is the correct interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1): Petitioners cannot claim they were denied a benefit of employment if the Department granted them the full measure of leave due to them under section 6323(a)(1).[3] Accordingly, the only issue we must decide is whether the Board correctly interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1). The Board's interpretation of a statute is a determination of law that we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> on appeal. <span class="Italic">Marano v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1141 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To conclude otherwise would be to conclude that USERRA mandates federal agencies to provide employees with unlimited military leave, irrespective of the detailed statutes granting federal employees specific periods of leave for training or active duty. We find no indication that Congress intended to blot out the military leave statutes when it passed USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The leave statute in question reads as follows, with the language in dispute emphasized:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection [pertaining to part-time employees], an employee as defined by section 2105 of this title or an individual employed by the government of the District of Columbia, permanent or temporary indefinite, is entitled to leave without loss in pay, time, or performance or efficiency rating for active duty, inactive-duty training (as defined in section 101 of Title 37), funeral honors duty (as described in section 12503 of title 10 and section 115 of title 32), or engaging in field or coast defense training under sections 502-505 of title 32 as a Reserve of the armed forces or member of the National Guard. <span class="Italic">Leave under this subsection accrues for an employee or individual at the rate of 15 days per fiscal year</span> and, to the extent that it is not used in a fiscal year, accumulates for use in the succeeding fiscal year until it totals 15 days at the beginning of a fiscal year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1) (2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The unadorned language of a statute is, as always, our starting point for statutory interpretation. <span class="Italic">Turtle Island Restoration Network v. Evans,</span> 284 F.3d 1282, 1291 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 123 S. Ct. 1748 (2003). The government, as did the Board, views this case as largely controlled by the language "15 days per fiscal year" in section 6323(a)(1). Amassing a wealth of authority maintaining that the plain and ordinary meaning of "day" is 24 hours, or one calendar day, the government argues that leave accruing at "15 days" per year must therefore accrue at 15 calendar days per year, not 15 workdays.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the ordinary meaning of "day" is a calendar day, and that the leave granted by section 6323(a)(1) accumulates at the rate of 15 calendar days per fiscal year. But to leap from this premise to the conclusion that non-workdays are properly chargeable against military leave begs the question at the heart of this case: whether an employee must be answerable to the government at all for time that he or she is not required to work. If one does not need leave from the government to attend reservist training on one's own time, then leave time measured in calendar days is no different than leave time measured in workdays. As a general matter, employees are not accountable to their employers for time they are not required to work. We see no reason why federal employees need military leave for days on which they are not scheduled to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To put it another way, the "days" that section 6323(a)(1) refers to are <span class="Italic">leave</span> days, not "training days" or "reserve duty days." The statute purports to measure how many days of paid leave employees are entitled to, not how many days of reserve training they may attend. The result might be different if the statute provided that federal employees were entitled to attend 15 days of <span class="Italic">reserve training</span> per fiscal year, in which case the amount of leave would clearly be measured by the period of reserve training. Indeed, this interpretation may have been correct for the original version of section 6323(a) enacted in 1966, which provided that a federal employee "is entitled to leave without loss of pay...<span class="Italic">for each day,</span> not in excess of 15 days in a calendar year, <span class="Italic">in which he is on active duty or is engaged in field or coast defense training.</span>..." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a) (1976) (emphases added).[4] Leave days were thus granted according to the actual period during which an employee was on duty, subject to a 15-day maximum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Likewise, the predecessor Act of May 12, 1917, ch. 12, provided that federal employees were "entitled to leave of absence from their respective duties, without loss of pay...on all days during which they shall be ordered to duty with troops or at field exercises, or for instruction, for periods not to exceed fifteen days in any one calendar year." 40 Stat. 40, 72 (1917).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But in 1980, in the course of revising section 6323(a) to grant leave by the fiscal year rather than by the calendar year, Congress rephrased the statute into its present form, providing that leave "accrues for an employee or individual <span class="Italic">at the rate of 15 days</span> per fiscal year...." Pub. L. No. 96-431, 94 Stat. 1850 (1980) (emphasis added). In so doing, Congress changed the computation of leave days from a variable measurement pegged to the actual length of military training, to a constant measurement of 15 days. While leave computed by the actual period of reserve training necessarily includes non-workdays in the calculation, leave measured by an absolute number of days (15) does not. We therefore conclude that, at least since 1980, the statutory text of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1) has granted federal employees leave with pay for 15 days on which they would ordinarily be performing their duties for the federal government, rather than leave with pay for a training period of 15 days including days on which they were not required to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing discussion, it is largely irrelevant whether the term "days" in section 6323(a)(1) means "workdays" or "calendar days." But even assuming that the choice between "workday" and "calendar day" is dispositive in this case, we are not persuaded that the "days" of section 6323(a)(1) must be calendar days. The government contends that Congress knew how to distinguish between "days" and "workdays," as in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6302(a), which explicitly defines "days" as <span class="Italic">workdays</span> for purposes of subchapter I of title 63. Because Congress made no such provision for subchapter II, in which section 6323(a)(1) resides, the government argues that Congress by implication retained the ordinary meaning of "day" for purposes of subchapter II. Likewise, the government argues that Congress specifically used the term "workdays" in the active duty leave provisions of section 6323(b) and (d)(1), which demonstrates that Congress uses the specific term "workday" when it intends for leave to be measured in workdays.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, the government's argument for consistency in statutory interpretation might carry considerable weight. However, Petitioners direct our attention to another leave statute residing in subchapter II of title 63, section 6326, which grants federal employees three days of paid leave to attend the funeral of an immediate relative who died in combat while serving in the armed forces. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6326 (2000). Section 6326 simply grants "three days of leave," which, according to the government's argument, is universally understood to mean calendar days rather than workdays. Moreover, Congress enacted the funeral leave statute at the same time it enacted the active duty leave provision of section 6323(b), and we see in those statutes the same distinction between "days" of funeral leave and "workdays" of active duty leave. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6323(b), 6326; S. Rep. No. 90-1443 (1968), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4288. One would therefore conclude that section 6326 grants three calendar days of funeral leave, not three workdays. Yet immediately upon section 6326's passage, OPM's predecessor (the Civil Service Commission), acting by formal rulemaking and pursuant to explicit statutory authority, promulgated a regulation interpreting section 6326 to grant "3 workdays" of paid funeral leave. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.804 (1968). That regulation has remained unchanged to this day. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.804 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If OPM, acting with the full majesty of formal rulemaking, has declared "day" in section 6326 to mean "workday," then it is not apparent why "day" in section 6323(a)(1) should not. While consistency is not necessarily the paramount imperative of statutory interpretation, we, like other courts, are close-minded enough to expect that administrative agencies ordinarily will construe the same term in closely related statutes consistently. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Revenue of Or. v. ACF Indus., Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 332, 342 (1994); <span class="Italic">Beliveau v. Dep't of Labor,</span> 170 F.3d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 1999). The government, despite invitations from this court, cannot offer any rationale why "day" should mean "workday" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6326 but not for 5 <span id="Page_551"></span>U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1). Absent such a rationale, it would seem arbitrary and capricious for the government to count non-workdays when computing military leave, but not when computing other kinds of leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But the government's treatment of non-workdays was not even consistent within the military leave statute itself. Under the pre-2000 interpretation of section 6323(a)(1), employees were charged military leave for non-workdays in the middle of a training period, but not for non-workdays at the beginning or end of the training period. <span class="Italic">See To the Sec'y of the Army,</span> 27 Comp. Gen. 245, 253 (1947). For example, an employee with a Monday-Friday work schedule who attended reserve training from one Saturday to the next was charged for five days of military leave, because his non-workdays bookended the training period and therefore did not count against her military leave. In contrast, a similarly situated employee with a Thursday to Monday schedule (having Tuesdays and Wednesdays off) was charged the full eight days of leave for a Saturday to Saturday training session, because his non-workdays fell entirely within the training period and were counted against his leave. As was the case for the discrepancy between funeral leave and military leave, the government is unable to articulate any rationale why some non-workdays counted as "days" under the former interpretation of section 6323(a)(1), but some did not. These inconsistencies do not compel Petitioners' view of the statute. However, they largely negate the force of the government's argument based on the distinction between "day" and "workday." We therefore adhere to our conclusion that the text of section 6323(a)(1) does not support the charging of non-workdays against military leave.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We think the government's textual arguments are further undermined by Congress's 2000 amendment adding section 6323(a)(3), or more precisely, by OPM's about-face in its interpretation of section 6323(a)(1) in response to that amendment. The amendment left the foundation for all the government's textual arguments untouched. Congress left intact the word "day," which we are told has an ordinary and accustomed meaning. The contrast between the "day" of section 6323(a) and the "workdays" of subchapter I and sections 6323(b)(1) and (d)(1) remains. Congress indicated no disagreement with many decades of administrative practice and Comptroller General opinions. Yet now, according to OPM, "day" in section 6323(a)(1) means "workday." It requires some effort to derive such a new interpretation solely from Congress's mandate to compute leave time in intervals of one hour, especially given that hourly computation for part-time employees under section 6323(a)(2) has cohabited comfortably with section 6323(a)(1) since 1980. While we do not begrudge agencies the opportunity to change their minds, it is difficult to believe that OPM could have revised its interpretation if the government's textual argument had any genuine appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we conclude that Petitioners have the better reading of the statutory text, we concede that section 6323(a)(1) may be susceptible to more than one interpretation. Because the will of Congress may not have been expressed unequivocally, we therefore consider whether Congress delegated to the Department authority to interpret section 6323(a)(1), entitling the Department's interpretation to a claim for judicial deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The government in particular contends that the Department may assume the mantle of OPM's interpretive authority (given that the Department has merely followed OPM's policy guidance), and that OPM's interpretation of the statute is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference on account of OPM's general authority to administer the federal personnel system. However, we conclude that the Department's policy is not entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference, either on its own or by deference inherited through OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Putting aside the question of whether the Department may lay claim to any deference that would be accorded to OPM, <span class="Italic">see Jones v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 295 F.3d 1298, 1307 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2002), there remains the problem that OPM lacks explicit authority to administer section 6323(a)(1). Although the absence of express rule-making authority is not dispositive, "a very good indicator of delegation meriting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> treatment" may be found in express congressional authorization to engage in formal rulemaking. <span class="Italic">United States v. Mead Corp.,</span> 533 U.S. 218, 229-31 (2001). Section 6323 is notable for the absence of explicit OPM rulemaking authority. While Congress specifically gave OPM authority over all other subchapters of chapter 63, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6311 (subchapter I, annual and sick leave), 6332 (subchapter III, voluntary leave transfers), 6362 (subchapter IV, leave bank program), 6387 (subchapter V, family and medical leave), no such provision gives OPM authority over subchapter II, in which section 6323 appears. <span class="Italic">Within</span> subchapter II, Congress granted rulemaking authority to OPM to administer sections 6322 (jury and witness leave), 6326 (funeral leave), and 6327 (bone marrow or organ donor leave), but not section 6323. Admittedly, this pattern might reflect nothing more than the historical accretion of the leave statutes, for several other provisions of subchapter II also lack a grant of authority to OPM. Nonetheless, the notable absence of explicit rulemaking authority must be weighed when determining whether the agency is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More significantly, neither the Department nor OPM has (under any other statutory authority) promulgated a formal rule setting forth its implementation of section 6323. In response to an inquiry from Petitioners' union, the Department indicated that its policy of charging reservists' military leave for non-workdays was embodied in the Department's "Time and Attendance Reporting Handbook," and the "OPM Military Leave website." The record shows that the Department's position was earlier set forth by "DOJ Order 1630.1B," dated July 22, 1991, while OPM's interpretation, as described by the Board, derived from the now-retired Federal Personnel Manual promulgated by the former Civil Service Commission, and from published and unpublished Comptroller General opinions issued in response to particular agency inquiries.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These sources are perhaps quintessential examples of "policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines" which lack the force of law and are not entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. <span class="Italic">Christensen v. Harris County,</span> 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000). Like the absence of specific congressional authorization, the absence of notice-and-comment rulemaking does not conclusively foreclose <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference, <span class="Italic">see Barnhart v. Walton,</span> 535 U.S. 212, 221-22 (2002); <span class="Italic">Mead,</span> 533 U.S. at 230-31, but this court has made clear that agency personnel policies embodied in informal sources such as handbooks and directives, including those originating in the Federal Personnel Manual, do not ordinarily merit <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. <span class="Italic">James v. Von Zemenszky,</span> 301 F.3d 1364, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (denial of rehearing); <span class="Italic">James v. Von Zemenszky,</span> 284 F.3d 1310, 1318-19 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the government does not actually attempt to distinguish <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> from the present case, we interpret the government's emphasis on the historical interpretation of the leave statutes as an argument that <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is warranted here due to the long-standing and consistent interpretation of section 6323(a) and its predecessors. As noted by the Board, federal employees historically were charged leave for intervening non-workdays falling within a period of leave, and the government directs us to Comptroller General opinions stretching back to 1930, all opining that reservists must be charged military leave for non-workdays occurring within the period of their absence. <span class="Italic">Matter of: Military Leave,</span> B-246,359, 71 Comp. Gen. 513 (1992); <span class="Italic">To the Attorney Gen.,</span> B-133,674, 1957 WL 1556 (Comp. Gen. Dec. 30, 1957); <span class="Italic">To the Postmaster Gen.,</span> 9 Comp. Gen. 448 (1930).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government does not suggest exactly why a long-standing administrative construction should be accorded more deference than those of more recent vintage. There is considerable logic to the position that, once <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> ceded to administrative agencies the power to select a permissible statutory construction in pursuit of policy goals, it became irrelevant whether the agency had adhered to that interpretation in the past, and for how long. <span class="Italic">See Barnhart,</span> 535 U.S. at 226 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court continues to accord extra deference to long-standing interpretations in the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> inquiry, <span class="Italic">see Barnhart,</span> 535 U.S. at 220-21, just as it has suggested that shifting interpretations are entitled to less, <span class="Italic">see Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala,</span> 508 U.S. 402, 417 (1993). Perhaps long-standing interpretations are thought more likely to be the result of reasoned agency deliberation rather than political expediency, though if the political branches are entrusted to implement policy there seems little reason to distinguish between the former and the latter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the stability of the government's interpretation does not overcome the lack of explicit congressional delegation or the absence of formal regulations. First, as we explain above, the operative element of the statutory text changed in 1980, when Congress revised the measure of the grant from days of training to days of leave. While subsequent pronouncements from OPM and the Comptroller General continued to rely on their older manuals and opinions for the interpretation that non-workdays should be charged against military leave, Congress's revision of the statutory text undermined the foundation of those older opinions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the long-standing interpretation of section 6323(a) was never exposed to the light of formal rulemaking, but remained embedded in policy statements, handbooks, directives and the like. The agency interpretation here contrasts with those in cases such as <span class="Italic">Barnhart,</span> in which the Court concluded that <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference was necessary because the agency's interpretation was set forth in a formal regulation promulgated pursuant to statutory authority. <span class="Italic">Barnhart,</span> 535 U.S. at 217. The stability of the agency interpretation at stake in <span class="Italic">Barnhart</span> may have answered criticisms that the agency's position was newly-minted in response to litigation, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 221, but it was not otherwise significant in the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> analysis. We explained in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> that, absent "special circumstances," factors such as "the length of time over which the agency has considered the question" do not confer <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference on personnel policies embodied in informal directives and handbooks. 301 F.3d at 1366. We find no special circumstances here that would overcome <span id="Page_552"></span>the ordinary reluctance to accord <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to informal agency interpretations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An informal agency interpretation may nonetheless claim a lesser degree of deference "proportional to its 'power to persuade,'" depending on such factors as its thoroughness, logic, expertness, and fit with prior interpretations. <span class="Italic">Mead,</span> 533 U.S. at 235 (quoting<span class="Italic"> Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co.,</span> 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)). Here, as we explain above, the government has been unable to propose any rationale or circumstance, other than the ossification of the statutory interpretation itself, that would support a claim for <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span> deference. We conclude that any deference owed to OPM or the Department under <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span> does not suffice to outweigh the contrary conclusions we draw from the statutory text.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aside from principles of administrative deference, the government advances an independent reason why age may grace a statutory interpretation with additional persuasive force: namely, that Congress may be presumed to know of long-standing administrative or judicial constructions, and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lorillard,</span> 434 U.S. at 580-81. But congressional inaction is perhaps the weakest of all tools for ascertaining legislative intent, and courts are loath to presume congressional endorsement unless the issue plainly has been the subject of congressional attention. <span class="Italic">See Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook County v. Army Corps of Eng'rs,</span> 531 U.S. 159, 169-70 (2001). Extensive hearings, repeated efforts at legislative correction, and public controversy may be indicia of Congress's attention to the subject. <span class="Italic">Id.; Lanehart v. Horner,</span> 818 F.2d 1574, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there is some evidence of congressional awareness here, we do not find it sufficient to establish congressional approval of the Department's interpretation of the statute. As noted by the Board, when Congress enacted Pub. L. No. 90-588, granting funeral leave (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6326) and extended active duty reserve leave (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(b)), the Senate Report accompanying the legislation voiced concerns that federal employees were not being granted enough leave for reserve training. The Post Office and Civil Service Committee directed the Civil Service Commission to prepare a report on the matter. S. Rep. No. 90-1443 (1968), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4288, 4289. The Commission's report, discussing summer encampment training periods, stated that "military leave is charged for intervening scheduled nonworkdays but not for scheduled nonworkdays at the beginning or end of a period of active duty." <span class="Italic">Improve Administration of Leave System for Federal Employees: Hearings on H.R. 12602 Before the House Comm. on Post Office and Civil Serv</span>., 92d Cong. 27 (1972) (report of the Civil Service Commission). The Commission's report further noted that federal employees' most frequent complaints about the military leave system were "(1) military leave charges should be made for workdays, not calendar days, and (2) military leave should be granted on a fiscal year, not a calendar year basis." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 28. The Commission counseled Congress against acting on either of these complaints. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 29. And Congress took no action to alter the military leave system until 1980, when its revisions of section 6323(a) changed the measurement of leave days and established the fiscal year as the basis for military leave. Congress made further minor amendments to section 6323 in 1991, 1994, 1996, and 1999, but left section 6323(a)(1) untouched until 2000, when it added the one-hour minimum charge provision that induced OPM to revise its interpretation of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of this history rises to the level that would indicate congressional understanding of or acquiescence to the administrative interpretation of section 6323(a)(1). While the Civil Service Commission report disclosed, at least to the Post Office and Civil Service Committees of Congress, that federal employees were being charged military leave for non-workdays falling within a period of military training, there is nothing in any of the legislative history demonstrating that Congress, individually or collectively, knew of or was concerned with this aspect of the leave system. Nor were there any legislative attempts to change the computation of leave days, the failure of which might indicate Congress's satisfaction with the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. Moreover, to the extent that Congress's 1980 amendment rendered the historical interpretations of section 6323(a)(1) untenable, it cannot be said that Congress re-enacted the statute without change. While there is no direct indication that Congress's 1980 amendment was intended to compel the exclusion of non-workdays from military leave, that amendment upset the textual basis of the historical interpretation of the leave statute. We therefore cannot conclude that Congress has acquiesced to or endorsed the former administrative interpretation of section 6323(a)(1)'s current text.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1) cannot be interpreted to require federal employees to expend military leave days for reserve training days on which they were not required to work. Accordingly, the full Board should have granted the petition for review on the ground that the decision of the administrative judge was based on an erroneous interpretation of the statute. We therefore reverse the decision of the Board and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323, federal employees are to be given up to 15 days of paid leave a year to attend training sessions required of them as members of military reserves or the National Guard. Until this section was amended in 2000, the Office of Personnel Management interpreted this provision as providing 15 calendar days of leave each year, rather than 15 work days, and federal agencies therefore followed the practice of charging employees military leave for absences on nonworkdays (e.g., weekends and holidays) when those days fell within a period of absence for military training. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 336 F.3d 1332, 1333-34 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

<p class="Body-Text">Military leave entitlement was also reviewed under 5 USC 6323, <span class="Italic">Baney v. DOJ</span>, 263 Fed. Appx. 892, 893-94 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Baney is employed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons as a cook supervisor in the agency's Seagoville, Texas facility. He is a member of the U.S. Coast Guard Reserve. He volunteered for active duty with the Coast Guard from July 6 through August 5, 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After returning from his summer active duty in Alaska, Mr. Baney learned that the agency charged him with eight days of regular military leave under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a) and 15 days of annual leave. Mr. Baney complained that the agency instead should have given him 22 days of military leave pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5232(b). Under Mr. Baney's view of the applicable leave provisions, he should not have been forced to use his annual leave and section 6323(a) leave. The agency disagreed. Mr. Baney appealed to the Board, arguing that he had been deprived of 22 days of leave under section 6323(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA, a member of the uniformed military reserves (as Mr. Baney is) may seek to establish before the Board that he has been denied a benefit of employment due to performance of military duty. If Mr. Baney could establish entitlement to leave under section 6323(b), which he was denied, the Board has authority to order corrective action that would comply with the USERRA provisions. The question before the administrative judge thus was whether Mr. Baney established his claim of entitlement to leave under section 6323(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 6323(b), as stated by the administrative judge, allows for up to 22 days of leave for military service under carefully specified conditions. Precisely, such service must be under section 331, 332, 333 or 12406 of Title 10 (each provision requiring service to aid civil authorities), or for service to a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory of the United States, or for service as a result of a call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation. The administrative judge construed each of the service provisions in section 6323(b) to require a call to duty, that is, an order requiring the person to assume active duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted that Mr. Baney testified that he "solicited" himself for active duty and conceded that he had not been called or ordered to active duty. Nonetheless, Mr. Baney and an agency timekeeper thought that Mr. Baney was entitled to leave under section 6323(b). Because he had volunteered for service, rather than having been called or ordered, the administrative judge held that Mr. Baney had produced no evidence entitling him to leave under the strict terms of section 6323(b).</p>

Until this section was amended in 2000, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interpreted this provision as providing 15 calendar days of leave each year, rather than 15 workdays, and some federal agencies generally followed the practice of charging employees' military leave accounts for absences on non-workdays (e.g., weekends and holidays) when those days fell within a period of absence for military training. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh,</span> 336 F.3d at 1333-34.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is entitled to relief under USERRA if, as a result of the agency's improper administration of military leave, he was forced to use some form of civilian leave to fulfill his military obligations.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant simply averred that the information contained in his AF Form 526s for the period of 1980 through 1989 accurately reflected his military reserve service and that his spreadsheet derived from those military service records reflected the weekends the agency allegedly would have improperly charged him military leave and the time periods that followed thereafter during which the agency allegedly would have required him to use annual leave to cover his absences for military service. However, the appellant did not, in fact, provide a sworn affidavit as to the specific dates the agency improperly charged him military leave and the specific dates he was thereafter forced to use annual leave to cover his absences for military service. The record indicates that the appellant has no independent recollection or documentary evidence that can specifically identify the dates the agency actually improperly charged him military leave, let alone if and when the agency actually improperly required him thereafter to use civilian leave to cover his absence for military service. Rather, the appellant has continuously acknowledged that he is only swearing to the accuracy of the information contained in his AF Form 526s and, further, that the dates he asserts he was improperly charged military leave and the dates the agency thereafter required him to use civilian leave to cover his military service are derived from the information in his AF Form 526s based on the court's notation in the background section of <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> regarding the way the Department of Justice and various other Federal agencies had charged employees for military leave prior to 2000.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pucilowski v. DOJ</span>, 498 F.3d 1341, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2007), synopsizes <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh's</span> application to National Guard members:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1), federal government employees who are members of the National Guard are entitled to 15 days of annual military leave "without loss in pay, time, or performance or efficiency rating for active duty [or] inactive-duty training. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, guard members can carry-over up to 15 days of military leave from one year to the next, thereby enabling them to begin a fiscal year with as many as 30 days of military leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Prior to the 2000 amendment to section 6323, the government's standard practice was to charge guard members military leave for every day they were away on guard duty, even if they were not scheduled to work some of those days. In other words, a regular Monday to Friday employee who had guard duty from a Monday through the next Tuesday would be charged for nine days of military leave, rather than seven. However, in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span>, we held that this practice was contrary to section 6323 and constituted the denial of a benefit of employment in violation of USERRA. 336 F.3d at 1336, 1343.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pucilowsk, supra,</span> overruled Board decisions that USERRA did not provide authority to the Board to order agencies to correct military leave records, and <span class="Italic">Pucilowsk</span> also cleared up some questions concerning calculations of benefits due to those whose military leave was improperly denied, 498 F.3d at 1344-45:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to correction of his civilian and military pay records, USERRA provides that a member of "a uniformed service shall not be denied...any <span class="Italic">benefit of employment</span> by an employer on the basis of that membership." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) (emphasis added). The term "benefit of employment" is given an "expansive interpretation." <span class="Italic">Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1484-85 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see also Peterson v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 237 (1996). It includes "any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest (other than wages or salary for work performed) that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2). To the extent that it is not already clear from <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span>, 336 F.3d at 1336, we restate that military leave afforded by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a) is a benefit of employment. Indeed, military leave "accrues by reason of" Pucilowski's employment with the government, and the fact that it is a benefit afforded him by force of statute makes it no less a part of his "employment agreement" than if it had been negotiated via collective bargaining or any other process. <span class="Italic">See also Fernandez v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 234 F.3d 553, 555-57 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (finding that the living quarter allowance provided to members of the armed forces under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5923(a)(2) is a "benefit of employment").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board plainly has the authority under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324 to remedy denial of military leave benefits. Indeed, section 4324(c)(2) provides: "If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management has not complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board <span class="Italic">shall enter an order requiring the agency or Office to comply with such provisions</span> and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance." Accordingly, the board erred by failing to order the Department of Justice, the Transportation Security Administration, the United States Department of Defense Finance &#x0026; Accounting Service, and any other relevant agency to correct their records to reflect a proper accounting of Pucilowski's military leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject Pucilowski's suggestion that he is entitled to monetary compensation based solely on the 22 days of improperly charged military leave. Indeed, a veteran is legally entitled to monetary compensation or its equivalent only where he demonstrates actual harm. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh</span>, 336 F.3d at 1333-36. Therefore, we find no reversible error in the AJ's decision to compensate Pucilowski only for the five days of LWOP that he was forced to take as a result of improperly charged military leave, and not for the days of military leave themselves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize, however, that agencies have not been entirely consistent in how they compensate veterans for <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> violations. In some cases, they have provided monetary compensation or annual leave days for improperly charged military leave even though the veteran has not been able to demonstrate actual harm. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 498 F.3d at 1330, No. 2006-3375, the Air Force provided monetary compensation both for annual leave days taken as a result of <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> violations and for the 12 days of improperly charged military leave. <span class="Italic">See also Garcia v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 463 (2006); <span class="Italic">Perih v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 454 (2006); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 415 (2006); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 343 (2006). However, in other cases, agencies have declined to provide such compensation where no actual harm was shown. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Roy v. Dep't of the Treas.</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 638 (2006); <span class="Italic">Rubel v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 196 (2006); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 468 (2006). We make clear that, while not legally obligated to do so, agencies may resolve claims by providing more compensation than an individual has been able to prove. This practice, as illustrated by <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, <span class="Italic">Perih</span>, <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, and <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, is appropriate as a matter of administrative convenience, especially if the records before them are deficient or incomplete. But it also helps to ensure that veterans are appropriately given the benefit of the doubt in the face of such records and fully enjoy the presumption that veterans' <span id="Page_554"></span>benefits statutes are to be resolved in their favor. <span class="Italic">E.g. King v. St. Vincent's Hosp.</span>, 502 U.S. 215, 220 n.9 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also Kirkendall v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 843-44 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323, Federal employees are to be given up to 15 days of paid leave a year to attend training sessions required of them as members of military reserves or the National Guard. Until this section was amended in 2000, the Office of Personnel Management interpreted this provision as providing 15 calendar days of leave each year, rather than 15 workdays, and federal agencies therefore followed the general practice of charging employees' military leave accounts for absences on nonworkdays (e.g., weekends and holidays) when those days fell within a period of absence for military training. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 336 F.3d 1332, 1333-34 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span>, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, even before the 2000 amendment, agencies were not entitled to charge employees' military leave accounts for days when they would not otherwise have been required to work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an appellant is entitled to relief under USERRA if, as a result of the agency's improper administration of military leave, she was forced to use annual leave or LWOP in order to fulfill her military obligations. In such a case, the Board will order compensation for the resulting lost wages or benefits. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311(a), 4324(c); <span class="Italic">Dombrowski v.

In a USERRA case such as this, i.e., one in which the appellant is alleging that the agency denied her a benefit of employment on the basis of her military service, the appellant bears the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that her military service was a "substantial or motivating factor" in the adverse employment action and, if the appellant meets this requirement, the agency then has the opportunity to come forward with preponderant evidence to show that it would have taken the same action anyway for a valid reason. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). However, in these military leave cases, it is generally self-evident that, if the agency improperly charged the appellant's military leave account on a nonworkday when the appellant was performing military duties, the appellant's military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the action. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 490, &#x00B6; 8 (2002), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds,</span> 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision that requires the Board to modify its approach to military leave cases under USERRA. In <span class="Italic">Pucilowski</span>, No. 2006-3388, slip op. at 4-5, the court found that the Board has the authority under USERRA to order a remedy for an agency's improper denial of military leave benefits by requiring agencies to correct the employee's leave record to reflect a proper accounting of military leave. Previously, the Board had held in <span class="Italic">Dombrowski</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, that it lacks the authority to order an agency to correct employees' military leave records. In light of <span class="Italic">Pucilowski</span>, <span class="Italic">Dombrowski</span> is no longer good law and it is therefore OVERRULED. An appellant may establish entitlement to relief under USERRA by showing that the agency improperly charged her military leave, whether or not the improper charging of military leave resulted in the appellant's being forced to use annual leave or LWOP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 95 MSPR 44, 51 &#x00B6; 16 (2003), determined that no USERRA violation occurred under 10 USC 971(b) when an agency modified an employee's service computation date to eliminate an improper grant of service credit (affecting rates of leave accrual) based on service of the employee as a cadet in a military academy. The change was compelled by statute, meaning that the agency's practice did not deny the appellant a benefit of employment due to his performance of duty in the uniformed service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tully v. DOJ,</span> 481 F.3d 1367, 1368-71 (Fed. Cir. 2007), ascertained no USERRA violation when the employing agency paid salary for holidays during short periods of leave of absence for jury or witness duty but did not pay for holidays for the appellant during the time that he was on extensive military leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tully served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 9, 1995, to April 9, 1998. While serving, Mr. Tully was absent from his position with his employer, the Federal Bureau of Prisons ("BOP"), an agency within the U.S. Department of Justice. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 ("USERRA") provides that when an employee is absent for military service, the employee is</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;deemed to be on furlough or leave of absence while performing such service; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;entitled to such other rights and benefits...as are generally provided by the employer of the person to employees...who are on furlough or leave of absence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1). Pursuant to government policy, the BOP placed Mr. Tully on leave without pay for the duration of his active service and did not pay him. After completing his term of active service, Mr. Tully appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board from the BOP's failure to pay him for holidays during his leave of absence. His primary argument was that the BOP's failure to pay him for holidays violated his rights under section 4316(b)(1)(B) because the agency provided holiday pay to employees who took paid leaves of absence to attend judicial proceedings as jurors or witnesses and therefore was obligated to provide holiday pay for him while he was on leave for military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review by this court, Mr. Tully argues that the administrative judge misinterpreted section 4316(b)(1)(B). He argues that the statute entitles uniformed service members to the best benefits available to any employee for any leave of absence, and that it is therefore impermissible for employees on court leave to receive better benefits than employees on a leave of absence for military purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with Mr. Tully's analysis of the statute. We hold that the "leave of absence" to which section 4316(b)(1)(B) refers is not any leave of absence, but rather one comparable to the leave provided to the service member for military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 4316(b)(1)(B) does not define the type of "leave of absence" that triggers a right to equivalent treatment for employees on leave for military service, the statute's legislative history makes clear that it is limited to a furlough or leave of absence comparable to the service member's. Both the Senate and House reports state that section 4316(b)(1) was meant to codify the decision in <span class="Italic">Waltermyer</span> [<span class="Italic">Waltermyer v. Aluminum Co. of America,</span> 804 F.2d 821 (3d Cir. 1986)], which entitles service members to treatment equivalent to the most favorable treatment accorded to other employees for "any particular leave." H. Rep. No. 103-65(I), at 33-34 (1993), <span class="Italic">available at</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2466-67; <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 103-158, at 58 (1993). <span class="Italic">Waltermyer</span> identified the particular leave of absence whose benefits must be afforded a service member as leave on account of an absence similar to that of the service member. 804 F.2d at 822, 825. That standard reflects the purpose of <span class="Italic">Waltermyer</span>--to require that service member employees receive benefits equal to, but not more favorable than, those generally available to all employees of the employer. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 823-24. Any fair comparison of the benefits available to different groups of employees must not disregard the circumstances in which the benefits are provided; one such circumstance is the expected length of the employee's absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate report reflects the congressional concern that a service member employee not "receive greater benefits...by virtue of performing service in the uniformed services than would have been accorded if the person had not left that employment for uniformed service." S. Rep. No. 103-158, at 59. Mr. Tully's interpretation of section 4316(b)(1)(B) would have just such an effect. Accepting his position would mean that the benefits provided in connection with any absence from work, no matter how different in character from the service member's absence, must be provided for all absences attributable to uniformed service. Presumably, that interpretation would mean, for example, that because the agency pays the salaries of employees who are absent to serve as jurors, it would be required to pay Mr. Tully his full salary for the entire term of his active service in the Army. But Mr. Tully has not shown that if he had taken a leave of absence from the agency for two and a half years for <span id="Page_555"></span>reasons other than military service the BOP would have paid his salary for that entire period. <span class="Italic">Cf. Monroe v. Standard Oil Co.</span>, 452 U.S. 547, 563-64 (1981) (under a predecessor statute to USERRA, rejecting the notion that Congress intended that employee-reservists "earn the same amount of pay that they would have earned without absences attributable to military reserve duties"). To assure equal but not preferential treatment, the benefits sought by a service member must be compared with the benefits associated with absences similar to the service member's.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found Mr. Tully's absence to be substantially different from an absence for court duty because of the different lengths of the periods of absence and thus declined to require that Mr. Tully be accorded the same benefits as those enjoyed by employees on court leave. The <span class="Italic">Waltermyer</span> court recognized that factors such as the duration or voluntariness of an absence are proper grounds for assessing similarity, and it was therefore appropriate for the administrative judge to rely on the difference in the expected duration of the two forms of leave in determining whether they were comparable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.150 (2005) (stating, in interpreting section 4316(b)(1)(B) of USERRA for employers other than the federal government, that "[i]n order to determine whether any two types of leave are comparable, the duration of the leave may be the most significant factor to compare. For instance, a two-day funeral leave will not be 'comparable' to an extended leave for service in the uniformed service."); U.S. Dep't of Labor Vet. Employment &#x0026; Training Serv., <span class="Italic">A Non-Technical Resource Guide to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act</span> 9 (Mar. 2003) ("[Under section 4316(b),] [i]f there is a variation among different types of nonmilitary leaves of absence, the service member is entitled to the most favorable treatment so long as the nonmilitary leave is comparable. For example, a three-day bereavement leave is not comparable to a two-year period of active duty.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the administrative judge's suggestion that Mr. Tully's absence was also different from court leave because court leave is paid while Mr. Tully's leave was not. Payment of an employee's salary while the employee is absent from work is a benefit provided during the absence, not a characteristic of the absence. To allow differences in the available benefits to negate relief under section 4316(b)(1)(B) would undermine the effect of the statute, which is designed to remedy differences in the benefits provided for military leave and leave for other purposes. Any error in the administrative judge's reliance on the fact that court leave is paid was harmless, however, because the administrative judge separately relied on the difference between the typically brief duration of an absence for court duty and Mr. Tully's two and a half year absence for active service in the Army. That factor reflects a significant difference in the character of the two forms of leave, and the administrative judge's reliance on that factor was appropriate. Accordingly, we uphold the decision of the Board denying relief to Mr. Tully on his claim for holiday pay during the period of his active duty in the Army.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Documentation requirements for military leave claims were addressed in <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 674 F.3d 1359, 1362-64 (Fed. Cir. 2012), affirming the Board's denial of a claim based on testimony rather than personnel records (some records being unavailable):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Duncan did not provide his civilian records (also called time and attendance records, leave and earning statements, or leave slips), which would identify any dates the Air Force charged him military or annual leave. Counsel for the Air Force represented that if Mr. Duncan had provided his civilian records and the records showed that he took annual leave as a result of improperly charged military leave, the Air Force would have compensated him for those days. In this case, however, it is undisputed that Mr. Duncan's civilian records no longer exist, a fact that the Air Force admitted in a sworn declaration and that the Air Force's counsel conceded at oral argument. Thus, all involved agree that Mr. Duncan could not obtain his civilian records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge granted Mr. Duncan's request, finding credible his recollection that "he had to take annual leave to meet his military obligations." <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Dep't of Air Force,</span> No. DA-4324-10-00724-1 (Mar. 4, 2010)). The Air Force filed a petition for review to the Board. The Board granted the petition and reversed the initial decision. The Board held that as a matter of law the initial decision was inconsistent with Board precedent in which:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Board has required more than an appellant's personal recollection and reliance on military documents to carry the burden of proof.... The appellant neither submitted time and attendance records from his civilian employment, nor showed that he attempted to obtain these records from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri. We find that the appellant has not submitted sufficient evidence to establish that, more likely than not, the agency improperly charged <span id="Page_556"></span>military leave on non-workdays and that he was required to use annual leave to fulfill his military obligations on the dates specified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Duncan v. Dep't of Air Force,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 275, 278-79 (2010)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Duncan appealed. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To obtain compensation for a <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> claim, the petitioner must show that he performed reserve duty on non-workdays, that the agency charged him military leave on those days, and that he exhausted his military leave and was charged other leave to fulfill his reserve obligation. <span class="Italic">See Pucilowski v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 498 F.3d 1341, 1344-45 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The petitioner bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 390, 393 (2007); <span class="Italic">O'Bleness v. Dep't of Air Force,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 457, 461 (2007); <span class="Italic">Haskins v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 616, 621 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the first element is not in dispute. Mr. Duncan provided military records showing that he performed reserve duty on 38 non-workdays from 1980 to 1998. The second and third elements (charged military and annual leave) are at issue in this appeal. Mr. Duncan relied solely upon his own oral testimony and documents created by his counsel's office to prove those elements. Though the counsel-created calendar and table visually show the dates on which he testified, these were similar to demonstratives summarizing his testimony and not evidence independent of his testimony to prove the underlying facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that civilian records would be sufficient evidence to satisfy the military and annual leave elements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davenport v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 580, 586 (2007); <span class="Italic">Cobb v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 390 (2007); <span class="Italic">O'Bleness v. Dep't of Air Force,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 457, 461-62 (2007); <span class="Italic">Haskins v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 616, 622-23 (2007). In this case, the parties agree that those records do not exist, so this court must consider whether, absent such records, the Board erred in finding that Mr. Duncan did not establish his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board believed that Mr. Duncan was merely speculating about having to use annual leave based on his review of his military records, such that his recollection was not independent. The Board found that, "it is apparent that these dates are based upon speculation arising from his review of the DFAS records showing his dates of military service and his understanding that the agency would have charged him military leave on non-workdays." <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Dep't of Air Force,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 275, 278-79 (2010)). Accordingly, the Board held that something more was required to substantiate Mr. Duncan's claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, Mr. Duncan did not supply any evidence other than his testimony. He has not provided, for example, any other contemporaneous documents, physical evidence, or witness testimony to corroborate his testimony. The record does not show that all corroborating evidence was unavailable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the record reflects and the Board acknowledged that supervisors, not petitioners, charge military and annual leave. Even after an employee makes a request for military or annual leave, the supervisor must authorize and take additional, necessary steps to charge military or annual leave. Thus, a petitioner may not be in the best place to know of the procedures adopted and followed by his employer. Therefore, on the facts of this case, this court cannot say that it was erroneous for the Board to find that Mr. Duncan's testimony was not based on his independent recollection and was not supported otherwise by evidence in the record. Given these findings, the Board did not err in denying Mr. Duncan relief. Accordingly, this court affirms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In affirming the Board, this court does not create a blanket rule; rather, this court holds that determinations regarding the sufficiency of the evidence must be determined by the Board on a case-by-case basis. This Court would not foreclose, for example, the Board from admitting and relying upon a petitioner's testimony in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, this court recognizes the Board's responsibility and expertise in adjudicating each case on its merits. For instance, in deciding what evidence to consider, the Board did not reach or rely on the Air Force's challenges to the Administrative Judge's credibility determinations. Therefore, that aspect of this case was not before this court on appeal. The Board states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency raises several claims on review, including but not limited to, challenges to the administrative judge's credibility findings and weighing of the evidence...However, in light of our findings concerning the insufficiency of the appellant's evidence, we need not address these claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Duncan v. Dep't of Air Force,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 275, 277 n.2 (2010)). The statutory standards of review give the Board broad leeway to determine the proper adjudicatory methods for these cases, and this case presents no reversible error.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Welshans has been employed by the United States Postal Service since 1981. From August 1983 until August 2004, he also served as a reservist in the United States Army.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2006, Welshans filed an appeal with the board, alleging that the Postal Service had improperly charged him for military leave. He asserted that he should not have been charged leave for days, such as Sundays and holidays, which fell within a period of absence for military training, but which were not his scheduled Postal Service workdays.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision, dated December 19, 2006, an administrative judge found that the Postal Service had acted in violation of its Employee and Labor Relations Manual ("ELM") when it charged Welshans for military leave on August 21 and August 23, 1999. On appeal, however, the board reversed. The board determined that the administrative judge had improperly applied the 2002 version of the ELM, rather than the ELM in effect in 1999. Because the board concluded that the ELM in effect in 1999 unambiguously required that the Postal Service charge non-workdays falling within a period of absence for active duty against military leave, it dismissed Welshans' appeal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Welshans then timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Welshans argues that the Postal Service should not have charged him military leave for days on which he was away from his workplace on reserve duty, but which were not his scheduled workdays at the Postal Service. He advances three arguments. First, he contends that charging him leave for non-workdays is contrary to this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice,</span> 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Second, he asserts that Postal Service regulations, contained in the ELM, prohibit charging an employee military leave for non-workdays. Finally, he argues that charging leave for non-workdays constitutes a facial violation of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1), certain employees of the federal government are granted "15 days per fiscal year" of military leave.[*] In <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span>, this court concluded that the word "days" in section 6323 should be construed to mean workdays rather than calendar days. 336 F.3d at 1336-42. Our decision was premised on the fact that the Office of Personnel Management had determined that the term "days" meant workdays in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6326, a "closely related" federal leave statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1338-39 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.804). Administrative agencies are expected to "construe the same term in closely related statutes consistently," and since the term "days" had been construed to mean workdays in section 6326, we concluded that it should be construed to mean workdays in section 6323 as well. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because we determined that section 6323 grants employees fifteen workdays, rather than fifteen calendar days, of military leave, we held that the Department of Justice was prohibited from charging non-workdays against its employees' military leave. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1337-42.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] In relevant part, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[A]n employee as defined by section 2105 of this title...is entitled to leave without loss in pay, time, or performance or efficiency rating for active duty, inactive-duty training...funeral honors duty...or engaging in field or coast defense training...as a Reserve of the armed forces or member of the National Guard. Leave under this subsection accrues for an employee or individual at the rate of 15 days per fiscal year and, to the extent that it is not used in a fiscal year, accumulates for use in the succeeding fiscal year until it totals 15 days at the beginning of a fiscal year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Butterbaugh,</span> however, affords Welshans no remedy. The only issue addressed there was "the correct interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh,</span> 336 F.3d at 1336. By statute, the Postal Service is specifically excluded from the application of section 6323. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(e) ("Except as otherwise provided by law, an employee of the United States Postal Service...is deemed not an employee for purposes of this title."); <span class="Italic">Nigg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 321 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The provisions of Title 5 do not apply to the Postal Service unless Congress has specifically so provided."); <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 811 F.2d 1498, 1501 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("[T]he Postal Service [is] an independent establishment of the executive branch with very limited application of federal employee law."). Because section 6323 is inapplicable to Postal Service employees, nothing in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> prohibits the Postal Service from charging non-workdays against its employees' military leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;The Employee and Labor Relations Manual</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 6323 does not apply to the Postal Service, agency employees are entitled to military leave under the provisions of the ELM. Under current regulations, the agency does not charge non-workdays falling within a period of military service against an employee's military leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> ELM &#x00A7; 517 (effective Sept. 8, 2001). But in 1999, the year in which Welshans' disputed leave was charged, the ELM provided that: "Nonworkdays falling within a period of absence for active duty are charged against the paid military leave allowed for full-time employees during the fiscal year, but nonworkdays falling at the beginning and end of an active duty period are not charged." ELM &#x00A7; 517.53. Thus, during the relevant time period, the ELM unambiguously required that the Postal Service charge non-workdays falling within a period of absence for military duty against military leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the fact that the plain language of the ELM in effect in 1999 required the agency to charge non-workdays against military leave, Welshans contends that the Postal Service intended to provide its employees with rights "analogous" to those provided to other federal employees by section 6323. In support, he argues that "[t]he [Postal Service] originally implemented a policy that mirrored the [f]ederal law [in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323] and then routinely amended that policy to reflect changes in the prevailing federal law despite the fact that it was under no statutory obligation to do so." In essence, Welshans argues that the Postal Service intended to "impliedly integrate" all section 6323 rights into the ELM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Welshans acknowledges, however, that he did not raise this argument--either before the administrative judge or the board. We decline, therefore, to consider it on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Rockwell v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 789 F.2d 908, 913 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("Our precedent clearly establishes the impropriety of seeking a reversal of the board's decision on the basis of assertions never presented to the presiding official or to the board."). Although "there are circumstances in which a federal appellate court is justified in resolving an issue not passed on below," <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Wulff,</span> 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976), no such circumstances are present here. It would be manifestly unfair for this court to resolve the question of whether the Postal Service intended to "impliedly integrate" section 6323 rights into the ELM without giving the government an opportunity to present evidence on the issue. <span class="Italic">See Hormel v. Helvering,</span> 312 U.S. 552, 556 (1941) (An appellate court's refusal to consider new arguments on appeal is "essential in order that parties may have the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues...[and] in order that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;USERRA</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Welshans contends that charging military leave for non-workdays is, on its face, a violation of USERRA. "USERRA represents Congress's most recent effort to create a comprehensive statutory scheme to provide civilian reemployment rights for those who serve in the armed forces in order 'to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service.'" <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal <span id="Page_557"></span>Serv.,</span> 540 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)). It prohibits discrimination against persons serving in the military by mandating that a member of "a uniformed service shall not be denied...any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">see Hernandez,</span> 498 F.3d at 1332 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA, the board has jurisdiction over a government employee's claim that he has been denied a "benefit of employment" on the basis of his membership in the uniformed services. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311(a), 4324(b). The term "benefit of employment" has been given an "expansive interpretation," <span class="Italic">see Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 145 F.3d 1480, 1484-85 (Fed. Cir. 1998), and has been construed to include military leave, <span class="Italic">Pucilowski v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 498 F.3d 1341, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to Welshans' assertions, however, the Postal Service's military leave policy did not deny reservists any benefit of employment. Instead, the ELM in effect in 1999 granted reservists an <span class="Italic">additional benefit</span> not available to non-military employees. While non-reservists were entitled to sick and annual leave, reservists were granted not only sick and annual leave, but military leave as well. Regardless of whether non-workdays are charged against military leave, such leave is a benefit available only to employees serving in the military. USERRA prohibits discrimination against reservists because of their service: there is nothing in the statute to prevent an agency from granting them benefits not available to other employees. <span class="Italic">See Fahrenbacher v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 500, 510 (M.S.P.B. 2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("To establish [USERRA] discrimination, [veterans] must show that they were treated more harshly than non-veterans. The fact that they were not treated better than non-veterans does not show discrimination.").</p>
