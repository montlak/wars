<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-254"><span class="space">x.</span> Time for Initiating a Grievance; Impact on Retroactive Recovery</h5>
<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding the statutory recovery period for overtime, an arbitrator may still be required to determine whether a contract sets a shorter period to initiate a grievance. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 3882 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ray Brook</span>, 59 FLRA 469 (2003) (remanding for resubmission to arbitrator on interpretation of grievance procedure allowing 40 days for grievance but also providing that period for filing grievance is longer when particular statute sets longer time limits for statutory claim). <span class="Italic">Nat'l Gallery of Art and AFGE Local 1831</span>, 48 FLRA 841, 843, 845-46 (1993), determined an arbitrator could apply the short period of time for filing a grievance to establish a contractual limitation period:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the 30-day filing requirement, the Arbitrator found that the grievants' overtime claims were not timely filed because regularly scheduled Sunday overtime was "discontinued several years prior to the hearing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, the Arbitrator found that the grievants' claims regarding jury duty and military leave were not timely filed because they involved incidents which occurred long before the 30 days prior to the filing of the grievance and did "not appear to involve a 'continuing practice or condition.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 14. Accordingly, the Arbitrator dismissed these claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the Arbitrator was required to apply the statute of limitations set forth in the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a), rather than the 30-day time period provided for in the parties' agreement. The Authority recently determined that an arbitrator is not required to apply the statute of limitations set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255 in resolving grievances under a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and American Federation of Government Employees,</span> 47 FLRA 819, 828-29 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). Moreover, the Union has not shown, and it is not otherwise apparent, that time periods applicable to lawsuits under the FLSA apply to the grievance in this case. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Army, Aviation Center, Fort Rucker, Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1815,</span> 39 FLRA 1113, 1115 (1991), <span class="Italic">See also Carter v. Gibbs,</span> 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Carter v. Goldberg,</span> 111 S. Ct. 46 (1990) (court held that under the Civil Service Reform Act and section 7121(a)(1) of the Statute, bargaining unit employees' claims to benefits under the FLSA must be resolved under the negotiated grievance procedure unless such matters are specifically excluded from the grievance procedure). Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator's application of the 30-day filing period set forth in the parties' agreement is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Union's exception constitutes mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's findings and conclusions regarding the grievant's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the agreement. Exceptions which disagree with arbitral determinations regarding the procedural arbitrability of a grievance generally provide no basis for finding an award deficient. For example, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Kansas City Center, Kansas City, Missouri and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2904,</span> 46 FLRA 440, 442 (1992). Accordingly, we will deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find no merit to the Union's contention that the Arbitrator violated the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, by limiting the grievants' backpay award to 30 days prior to the filing of the grievance. The Union has not presented, and the Authority is not otherwise aware of, any law which prevents arbitrators from establishing the appropriate period for determining entitlement to backpay. <span class="Italic">See SSA,</span> 47 FLRA at 829. In addition, it is well established that arbitrators have broad authority and discretion to fashion remedies. For example, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916,</span> 47 FLRA 98, 101 (1993). Accordingly, we will deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Terre Haute, and AFGE Local 720</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-065.html">60 FLRA 298</a>, 299-300 (2004), added:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, at least where there is no indication that parties have agreed contractually to backpay periods different from those in &#x00A7; 255(a), the statutory periods control. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NOAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 821; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1494-95 (1998). In those circumstances, an arbitral award that limits FLSA backpay to the filing date of the grievance is contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a). <span class="Italic">See NOAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 821; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1494-95.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">NOAA</span> and <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, there is no contention in this case that the parties have agreed contractually to a recovery period different from &#x00A7; 255(a). Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">NOAA</span> and <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the recovery periods set forth in &#x00A7; 255(a) control, and the Arbitrator's limitation of the recovery period retroactive to the filing date of the grievance is contrary to &#x00A7; 255(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NOAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 821; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1495. Accordingly, the awards are contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_2174"></span><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Crane Div. and AFGE Local 1415</span>, 49 FLRA 27, 30-32 (1994), explained that an arbitrator could tie FLSA backpay recovery to the period for the initiation of a grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 47 FLRA 819, 828-29 (1993) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>), we addressed the issue of backpay for overtime compensation under the FLSA and upheld an arbitrator's award granting backpay for a 6-year period. We found that the arbitrator was not required to apply the statute of limitations set forth in the FLSA and that the arbitrator properly resolved the dispute under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure and the Back Pay Act. We noted that nothing in the Back Pay Act limits the period of time for which an award of backpay can be made. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 47 FLRA at 828, and cases cited therein at 828-29. We also noted that arbitrators possess great latitude and discretion in fashioning remedies. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916</span>, 47 FLRA 98, 101 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no merit in the Union's contention that the award in this case violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.102 and 551.401 because it fails to grant backpay from the date the grievants were exempted from the FLSA. As relevant here, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.102(e) defines work which is "suffered or permitted." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.401(a) provides that, for the purpose of determining "hours of work" under the FLSA, "time during which an employee is suffered or permitted to work" is "hours of work." We find nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.102 or 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.401 which would preclude the Arbitrator in this case from limiting backpay to 20 days prior to the date the grievance was filed. Moreover, the Union has not demonstrated that any other statute or regulation obligated the Arbitrator to award backpay retroactive to the date the grievants were exempted from the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 386 and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 66 FLRA 26, 29-32 (2011), sustained an award denying FLSA overtime based on the arbitrator's determination that the grievance was not filed within the time allowed by the contract:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's timeliness finding is not contrary to &#x00A7; 255(a) of the FLSA </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator failed to apply the statutory time limit set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) for filing a claim for FLSA overtime. As set forth above, an arbitrator's procedural arbitrability determination may be found deficient on the ground that it is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 59 FLRA at 470.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress established in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) that "[a]ny action" brought under the FLSA "may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued,...except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued[.]" The Authority has held that this provision "both limits an employee's ability to bring a cause of action for a violation of the FLSA and limits the period that an employee can recover backpay for such a violation." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1488-89 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the federal sector, all collective bargaining agreements "shall provide procedure<span class="Italic">s </span>for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). Further, any collectively bargained agreement "may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(2). Thus, under &#x00A7; 7121, parties must establish, through collective bargaining, the procedures for resolving grievances and may exclude any matter (e.g., FLSA claims) from those procedures. In so doing, the parties are free to determine the procedural requirements--including time limits--that will govern resolution of grievances that arise under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator correctly found, nothing in the parties' agreement excludes FLSA grievances from the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. Similarly, nothing in the parties' agreement expressly incorporates the time limit in &#x00A7; 255(a) for initiating an FLSA claim as part of the parties' grievance procedure. Accordingly, having elected to pursue its FLSA claim through the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, the Union is bound by the grievance procedures for which the parties collectively bargained pursuant to &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., O'Conner v. United States</span>, 60 Fed Cl. 164, 171 (2004) (quoting <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Carter</span>) (overruled in part, <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States, </span>308 F.3d 1220 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">Mudge</span>)) ("By accepting a position covered by the collective bargaining agreement, appellants effectively chose the procedures negotiated by the union.")); <span class="Italic">see also Boaz v. Fed. Express Corp., </span>742 F. Supp. 2nd. 925, 933 (W.D. Tenn. 2010) (<span class="Italic">Boaz</span>) ("procedural rights of the FLSA can be abridged by contractual limitations") (citing <span class="Italic">14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett</span>, 129 S. Ct. 1456 (2009)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Union argues that its grievance is timely. According to the Union, the time limit set forth in &#x00A7; 255(a) for initiating an FLSA claim is a substantive right, and, as such, the statutory time limit--and not the thirty-day time limit set forth in the parties' negotiated grievance procedure--applies. Exceptions at 9-19 (citing, among other cases, <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1490).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Statutory time limits for initiating a legal claim, however, are generally procedural. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Banas v. American Airlines</span>, 969 F.2d 477, 485 (7th Cir. 1992) ("statutes of limitations [for initiating a claim] are generally considered to be procedural provisions"); <span class="Italic">FDIC v. Petersen</span>, 770 F.2d 141, 142 (10th Cir. 1985) ("Statutes of limitation [for initiating a claim] are generally considered to be procedural rather than substantive law."); <span class="Italic">Kalmich v. Bruno</span>, 553 F.2d 549, 553 (7th Cir. 1977), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 434 U.S. 940 (the basic choice of law rule is that statutes of limitations for initiating a claim are "procedural in their nature"). As explained below, the Union's exceptions provide no basis for departing from this general principle of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arguing that the time limit set forth in &#x00A7; 255(a) for initiating an FLSA claim is a substantive right that is incorporated into the parties' agreement, the Union asserts that the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>controls. However, contrary to the Union's assertion, <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>stands only for the narrow proposition that an arbitrator, resolving an FLSA claim brought under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, is bound to apply 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) to an award of backpay, absent an indication that the parties have agreed contractually to backpay periods different from those in &#x00A7; 255(a). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Ind.</span>, 60 FLRA 298, 299-300 (2004) (<span class="Italic">BOP</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">NOAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 821; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1494-95). That is, <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>explicitly applies only to the <span class="Italic">recovery period </span>for a FLSA violation--not to the <span class="Italic">filing period </span>for initiating a grievance alleging a violation of the FLSA under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure--and only where the parties have not contractually agreed to time limits different from those in &#x00A7; 255(a). Indeed, the Authority previously has held that an award is not deficient where an arbitrator followed the time period limiting the filing of grievances to that provided in the parties' collective bargaining agreement, rather than the statute of limitations established in [&#x00A7;] 255(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Gallery of Art, Wash., D.C.</span>, 48 FLRA 841, 845 (1993); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 819, 828 (1993); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Aviation Ctr., Fort Rucker, Ala.</span>, 39 FLRA 1113, 1115 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union further asserts, relying primarily on <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, that the express language of &#x00A7; 255(a) and the legislative history of the FLSA support its assertion that the time limit for filing a FLSA claim is a substantive right. In this regard, the Union contends, among other things, that applying the contractual time limit would frustrate Congress' intent to limit employers' liability and ensure that employees are adequately compensated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's assertion, nothing in the express language &#x00A7; 255(a) suggests that the time limit contained in the provision is a substantive right. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 48B Am. Jur. 2d <span class="Italic">Labor and Labor Relations</span> &#x00A7; 3394 (2010) (In suit under FLSA, "the statute of limitations is a conventional procedural statute[.]"). Moreover, applying the time limit set forth in the parties' negotiated grievance procedure for initiating an FLSA claim in the negotiated grievance procedure would not undermine Congressional intent. As to employer liability and employee compensation, the contractual time limit for initiating a grievance claiming a FLSA violation neither expands employer liability nor prevents employees from being compensated. Also, employees are free to assert their own, individual FLSA claims. They need not go through the Union and the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Mudge, </span>308 F.3d 1220 (holding that &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) of the Statute, as amended in 1994, does not restrict an employee's right to seek a judicial remedy for grievances). <span class="Italic">Cf. Filebark v. U.S. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 555 F.3d 1009, 1012 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (in finding that amendment to &#x00A7; 7121(a) of the Statute did not create court jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, court distinguished <span class="Italic">Mudge </span>on ground that it involved FLSA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, by electing to pursue its FLSA claims as a grievance through the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, the Union did not forgo the substantive rights guaranteed to individuals under the FLSA; it only agreed to pursue those claims in an administrative, rather than a judicial, forum. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.</span>, 500 U.S. 20, 26 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Gilmer</span>) ("By agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum." (quoting <span id="page_2175"></span><span class="Italic">Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</span> 473 U.S. 614, 628 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Mitsubishi</span>))). As the Supreme Court has noted, as "long as [a] prospective litigant effectively may vindicate [his or her] statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 28 (quoting <span class="Italic">Mitsubishi</span>, 473 U.S. at 637) (discussing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act). Consistent with this principle, the Federal Circuit has ruled that a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by a statute by agreeing to arbitrate a claim brought under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 909 F.2d at 1455. Specifically, the court acknowledged that "the collective bargaining mechanisms created by [the Statute] do not deprive employees of recourse to any of the <span class="Italic">remedies </span>otherwise provided by statute or regulation[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1455 (emphasis added) (quoting <span class="Italic">Karahalios v. NFFE, Local 1263</span>, 489 U.S. 527, 536 (1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Union claims that the Arbitrator's determination that &#x00A7; 255(a) defines the period of recovery for backpay, but not the filing time limit for an FLSA claim, would lead to absurd results. However, such claim provides no basis for finding the award deficient. The Arbitrator simply applied the contractual time limit for an employee to initiate a grievance claiming an FLSA violation under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. As stated previously, the award neither expands employer liability nor prevents employees from being compensated when a grievance claiming an FLSA violation is found to be timely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union further argues that, even assuming that the time limit for initiating a FLSA claim is procedural, it did not waive this right because there was no clear and specific waiver. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions at 21-22 (citing <span class="Italic">Bull</span>, 65 Fed. Cl. 407 (citing <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, 525 U.S. 70)). However, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bull </span>and <span class="Italic">Wright </span>is misplaced. These cases both hold that, absent a clear and explicit waiver, a collective bargaining agreement may not waive an employee's right to pursue a statutory claim in court. Here, there is no argument or assertion before us that, under the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement, individual employees were prohibited from filing their FLSA action in federal court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we find that the Union has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Union has not established that the Arbitrator erred in finding no continuing violation under the FLSA. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that, even if the Arbitrator's application of the thirty-day time limit in the parties' agreement is correct, then the Arbitrator erred by not applying the continuing violation theory to the Agency's alleged ongoing violation of employees' FLSA rights. We conclude that, even if the Arbitrator had applied the continuing violation theory, the award is not deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the "burden" was on the Union to show that employees met the requirements of the FLSA to establish a continuing violation. The Arbitrator found that the record contained insufficient evidence to show that the witnesses who testified for the Union as "examples of affected bargaining unit [employees]" worked overtime hours for which they were not paid within this time frame. According to the Arbitrator, although the Union was required to produce evidence to show that the employees worked unpaid overtime hours during the statute of limitations window, "[n]o such evidence was offered either at the hearing nor in the grievance letter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator erred in finding that there was insufficient evidence to show that these witnesses worked unpaid overtime hours under the FLSA.&#x2003;However, the Union does not contend that the award is based on a nonfact, and, as stated previously, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings when assessing whether the award is contrary to law. Accordingly, this contention provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Def.</span>, 55 FLRA at 40; <span class="Italic">see also NFFE, Local 1827</span>, 52 FLRA 1378, 1385 (1997) (exception challenging an arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence provides no basis for finding an award deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that fifteen employees listed in the Notice "received backpay plus interest for FLSA benefits[.]" The Arbitrator's factual findings, to which the Authority defers, further show that, other than the Union witnesses, the Union "did not identify any specific employees" who worked unpaid overtime hours under FLSA during the thirty-day window of the parties' agreement. As the Arbitrator found, there is no evidence to show that there was a violation that could give rise to a new cause of action for each failure to pay overtime under FLSA. In this regard, the Union did not provide any evidence to show that any of the fifteen employees worked unpaid overtime during the thirty-day time limitation provided in the parties' agreement. Because the Union has not pointed to any information in the record to show that these employees worked within thirty days of the date that the grievance was filed pursuant to Article VIII of the parties' agreement, the Union has not established a continuing violation under the FLSA with respect to these employees.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1001 and Dept. of Air Force, Vandenberg AFB</span>, 66 FLRA 647, 648 (2012), upheld an award that an FLSA grievance was not procedurally arbitrable because it failed to comply with the requirements of the contract distinguishing union and group grievances requiring the identification of concerned employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Arbitrator's rulings that the grievance was a group grievance under the parties' agreement and that the Union failed to follow the procedural requirements for processing group grievances are procedural arbitrability determinations. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 104</span>, 61 FLRA 681, 682 (2006) (finding that the arbitrator's determination that the union could not pursue the grievance as an institutional grievance was a procedural arbitrability determination). The Authority generally will not find an arbitrator's ruling on the procedural arbitrability of a grievance deficient on grounds that directly challenge the procedural arbitrability ruling itself. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3882</span>, 59 FLRA 469, 470 (2003).</p>
