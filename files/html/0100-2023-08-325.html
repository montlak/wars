<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-317"><span class="space">o.</span> Harassment; Hostile Working Environment; Remedy</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A USERRA claim is made out if the appellant asserts, in some detail, actions by agency personnel constituting harassment or a hostile working environment because of military service. <span class="Italic">Randall v. DOJ</span>, 105 MSPR 524, 526-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-10, 2007 MSPB 119 (2007), provides an example of a USERRA hostile environment claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 provides, among other things, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). The statute further provides that an employer (including a federal agency) shall be considered to have engaged in a prohibited activity if the individual's military status or obligation is a motivating factor for one of the actions identified above (denial of initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment), unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of the military status or obligation. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c); <span class="Italic">see Yates v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1998). An individual who believes that he has been the victim of a violation of section 4311(a) may file an appeal with the Board. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b); <span class="Italic">see Yates,</span> 145 F.3d at 1483.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal, the appellant must: (1) Show that he performed duty in a uniformed service of the United States or is otherwise covered by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); and (2) non-frivolously allege that he was subjected to one of the actions listed at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), such as denial of any benefit of employment, for one of the reasons listed at section 4311(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 10 (2004); <span class="Italic">Muse v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 164, &#x00B6; 12 (1999). A claim of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 10. The weakness of the assertions in support of a claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA claim for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if the appellant fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant showed that she performed duty in the uniformed service of the United States. She alleged that the agency discriminated against her on account of her obligation to perform military service by harassing her or creating a hostile environment. In her initial pleading before the administrative judge, the appellant alleged that the agency placed her in an absence without leave (AWOL) status in January 2005 when she had requested and been approved advanced annual leave to perform military duty; complained to her Reserve unit about insufficient advance notice of her military orders; disclosed confidential medical information to members of her military unit; and responded to her inquiry by stating that requests for leave to perform military duty "should not be believed as requiring automatic approval."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a subsequent filing, she alleged that her immediate supervisor, Luis Colcol, called her into his office on January 27, 2006; told her that her civilian position took precedence over her military obligation; and stated that he would speak to the agency's Human Resources Manager, Kevin Rison, about denying her requests for future military leave. The appellant also alleged that Colcol spoke to her in a verbally abusive tone, stated that he wanted to deny her requests for leave, and requested that she find a replacement for the time she was scheduled for military training. The appellant further alleged that on January 30, 2006, the agency contacted her military superior officer to demand that her upcoming training order be changed. As relief, she sought to have the agency cease threatening her with denial of military leave and placement on AWOL and to have the agency cease harassing her in regard to military leave commitments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge directed her to clarify her allegations in regard to her USERRA claim, the appellant submitted another statement on April 27, 2006, providing further details to her previous allegations and additional allegations. She stated that in July 2005 she timely submitted requests for leave for military duty which were approved, but in August, while she was performing military duty, her military superiors told her that her civilian employer informed them that she had not provided notice. She and an officer spent some time trying to get an explanation. The next day, the officer spoke to Rison who inquired about the appellant's medical problems. Rison had also contacted the active duty personnel department, the surgeon's staff, and the headquarters company staff seeking information about the appellant's medical status with the military. The appellant alleged that agency personnel continued to make telephone contacts to military personnel other than the designated contact. She also alleged that the agency planned to issue her an admonishment for displaying a photograph of the President and that her immediate supervisor told her, "That photo is offensive, and I'm writing you up." She characterized the agency's treatment of her as abuse of "those who volunteer their lives and step up to the plate, just to be treated like a piece of garbage and told their Commander in Chief is 'offensive,' yelled at when requesting military leave, threatened with AWOL, and humiliated at their unit due to unwarranted and questionable employer nuisance calls." She further stated that co-workers who were not members of the uniformed service were not treated similarly.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the appellant did not explicitly argue below that his various allegations should be considered together as a whole, we find that it would be appropriate to do so to determine whether he has made a nonfrivolous allegation of a hostile work environment under USERRA.

<p class="Body-Text">An agency's initial refusal to allow an employee entry to his former workplace, a secure workplace, or the agency's insistence on an agency escort of the employee during a visit to the office, did not rise to the level of a personnel action covered under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Brasch v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency discriminated against him in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a discrimination case under section 4311(a), such as the instant appeal, "[a] person who...has performed...service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that...performance of service." <span class="Italic">Gossage</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 455, &#x00B6; 10 (quoting 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a)). To establish jurisdiction over a USERRA discrimination claim before the Board, an appellant must nonfrivolously allege that: (1) he performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to his performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's service in the U.S. Coast Guard satisfies the first jurisdictional element of his discrimination claim. For the reasons that follow, we also agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's allegations fall outside of the prohibited actions listed in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, section 4311(a) enumerates several specific actions that an employer may not take on the basis of an appellant's military service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). The appellant's allegation that the agency placed a Blackberry in his personal vehicle does not fit within any of the specific examples of prohibited conduct listed in the statute, i.e., a denial of initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, or promotion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the only remaining category of prohibited conduct under the statute that could cover this act is a denial of "any benefit of employment." To resolve whether the agency's alleged action denied the appellant "any benefit of employment," we must interpret the meaning of this term under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6; 8 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In considering the language of the statute, the Board will look to the whole of the statute, including its overall structure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The provisions of the statute should be read in harmony, leaving no provision inoperative, superfluous, redundant, or contradictory. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Holley v. United States</span>, 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA defines the terms "benefit," "benefit of employment," and "rights and benefits" as "the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, including any advantage, profit, privilege, gain, status, account, or interest...that accrues by reason of an employment contract or agreement or an employer policy, plan, or practice." <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2). The definition further specifies that these terms cover rights and benefits in a pension or health plan, employee stock ownership, insurance coverage, "bonuses, severance pay, supplemental unemployment benefits, vacations, and the opportunity to select work hours or location of employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Both the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have recognized Congress's intent that the term "benefit of employment" be construed broadly. <span class="Italic">See Yates v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1484-85 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 235-36 (1996). Despite the expansive nature of this term, the Federal Circuit has held that a benefit of employment protected by USERRA must be "one that flows as a result of the person's employment...." <span class="Italic">Thomsen v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 169 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that the agency's alleged action did not deny the appellant any of the specific benefits of employment protected under USERRA, as set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2). The agency's alleged placement of a Blackberry in the appellant's car thus does not come within the plain language of section 4311(a), which bans discrimination involving the denial of "any benefit of employment" on the basis of military service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 987 F.2d 1552, 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (explaining that the plain language of a statute controls absent legislative intent to the contrary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, even liberally construing the definition of "benefit of employment," we find that the nature of the benefits listed in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2) are either those that flow to an employee because of his employment with his employer or those that affect the appellant's employment status or interest with his employer. <span class="Italic">See Thomsen</span>, 169 F.3d at 1381 (finding that membership in the Ready Reserves was not a benefit of the appellant's employment with the U.S. Secret Service); <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (holding that a "benefit of employment" is one that accrues to an employee because of civilian employment rather than military service); <span id="Page_561"></span><span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (holding that a denial of employment benefits includes the denial of leave and disciplinary action); <span class="Italic">cf. Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 142 F.3d 1444, 1447 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (interpreting "other incident or advantage of employment" under the prior version of USERRA to cover "one generally granted to all employees in [the] workplace"). The appellant has not alleged that the agency denied him any benefit granted to him by virtue of his employment with the agency, and he has cited no authority to support his theory that a "benefit of employment" under USERRA extends to rights and benefits that are created, and exist, independent of his employment relationship with the agency. We thus find no support for the appellant's reading of the term "any benefit of employment," and we decline to find that it encompasses rights that exist independent of an employee's employment relationship with his employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Thomsen</span>, 169 F.3d at 1381; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, applying this statutory interpretation of the term "any benefit of employment," we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency's alleged placement of a Blackberry in his personal vehicle denied him a benefit that flowed to him as a result of his employment with the agency. The provisions of law identified by the appellant--namely, criminal and civil statutes prohibiting unlawful wiretapping and freedom from unreasonable searches--exist not because of his employment with the agency, but are products of constitutional and Federal statutory law, <span class="Italic">see</span> U.S. Const. amend. IV; 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2510 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> These rights and benefits do not flow to him by virtue of his employment with the agency, and the agency's alleged infringement of these rights does not constitute a denial of "any benefit of employment" in violation of USERRA. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency discriminated against him in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency created a hostile work environment based on his military service in violation of USERRA.</span></p>

Some Federal circuit courts of appeals had disagreed with the Board's interpretation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) in this regard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Carder v. Continental Airlines, Inc.,</span> 636 F.3d 172, 179-80 (5th Cir. 2011). In late 2011, however, Congress amended the definition of "benefit of employment" in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2) to expressly provide that an employer may not discriminate against an employee on the basis of his military service with regard to "the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," thus allowing an appellant to allege a hostile work environment claim pursuant to USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> Act of November 21, 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-56, &#x00A7; 251, 125 Stat. 711 (2011); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dallas Independent School District</span>, 936 F. Supp.2d 767, 789 (N.D.

In light of the amendment to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2), we reaffirm that an appellant may assert a hostile work environment claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), provided he otherwise can establish the Board's jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Erlendson</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 7 (explaining that the assertion of a hostile work environment claim under USERRA is not a basis for Board jurisdiction, but rather is a matter that the Board may adjudicate in a USERRA appeal in which it has jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege the existence of a hostile work environment based upon two alleged incidents of agency misconduct: the agency's placement of the Blackberry in his personal vehicle; and the agency's follow-up investigation based upon his complaint. Relying on both the infrequent nature of the incidents and the lack of conduct that was humiliating or threatening, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was subjected to a hostile work environment in violation of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was subjected to a hostile work environment in violation of USERRA, we modify the initial decision to reach this conclusion on a different basis. Namely, upon review of the appellant's allegations, which we assume to be true, we find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency's purportedly hostile conduct toward him was based on his military status and that he thus has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency subjected him to a hostile work environment on the basis of his military service in violation of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not articulated the elements needed to establish the Board's jurisdiction over a USERRA hostile work environment claim, and instead has limited its decisions to finding that an employee may assert such a claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) in a USERRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Erlendson</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 7. Since Congress amended the definition of "benefit of employment" in late 2011 to permit hostile work environment claims under USERRA, courts that have considered this issue have looked to the elements of a hostile work environment claim under title VII. Applying those standards, the courts have held that, to establish such a claim, an employee must establish a "pattern of ongoing and persistent harassment severe enough to alter the conditions of employment" and prove that his workplace was both objectively and subjectively offensive, and that "any harassment took place on account of his protected status as a military service member." <span class="Italic">Montoya v.

In considering whether an appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based on his military service, we apply the Board's liberal approach to determining jurisdiction in a USERRA appeal, under which the relative weakness of an appellant's allegations concerning the seriousness of the alleged acts should not serve as a basis for a jurisdictional dismissal. <span class="Italic">Swidecki,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although we rely on the elements of a hostile work environment claim under title VII in this case, we find unpersuasive the case law cited by the appellant on review that "excessive monitoring is strong proof of a hostile work environment claim." The cases cited by the appellant demonstrate that close supervision of an employee, coupled with other acts of hostility, can evidence a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, however, the appellant has alleged only that the agency placed a Blackberry in his car, and, as explained below, he has made no allegation that this act was taken on the basis of his military status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even broadly construing the appellant's allegations, however, we find that he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency created a hostile work environment due to his service in the uniformed services. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 239. Absent from the appellant's pleadings is any assertion that the agency allegedly placed the Blackberry in his vehicle or investigated his complaint about the Blackberry on the basis of his active duty military status. This case is thus dissimilar from <span class="Italic">Petersen</span> where, for example, the appellant alleged that agency employees used derogatory terms toward him that negatively referenced his prior military service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 235. This appeal is also dissimilar from other cases where an employee has alleged that an employer has subjected him to a hostile work environment because of a protected characteristic, such as race or sex. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brennan v. Metropolitan Opera Association, Inc</span>., 192 F.3d 310, 318 (2d Cir. 1999) ("A plaintiff must also demonstrate that she was subjected to the hostility because of her membership in a protected class."); <span class="Italic">Nichols v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120110787, 2011 WL 1621515, at *3 (Apr. 20, 2011) (discussing that a hostile work environment charge under title VII involves "harassment in the form of unwelcome verbal or physical conduct <span class="Italic">involving the protected class</span>") (emphasis added). These cases confirm that an employee generally must allege some connection between the agency's acts of hostility and his protected status to bring the challenged conduct within the scope of the relevant anti-discrimination statute at issue. <span class="Italic">See Onacle v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc</span>., 523 U.S. 75, 80 (1998) ("Title VII does not prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace; it is directed only at '<span class="Italic">discriminat[ion]</span><span class="Italic"></span> ...because of...sex.'") (alterations in original). We thus similarly hold that, to establish the Board's jurisdiction over a USERRA hostile work environment claim, an appellant must nonfrivolously allege some connection between the alleged acts of hostility and the appellant's protected military status to bring the challenged conduct within the scope of USERRA's ban on military-service discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 239; <span class="Italic">see also Montoya</span>, 987 F. Supp.2d at 1017.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, where the appellant argues that the agency has committed certain acts, but has failed to allege that these acts were taken on the basis of his military status, we find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency altered the terms and conditions of his employment on the basis of his military service in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). Although the appellant's allegations raise the prospect that the agency took certain actions against him in response to his exercise of appeal rights under USERRA, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 13, which we analyze below, we find that he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency created a hostile work environment based on his military service by placing a <span id="Page_562"></span>Blackberry in his car or conducting an investigation into his complaint about such conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, although on somewhat different reasoning than the Board's, <span class="Italic">Kitlinski v. MSPB</span>, 857 F.3d 1374, 1379-82 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;The anti-discrimination provision of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), states that a person who is a member of a uniformed service shall not be denied "initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment" on the basis of his membership in the military or performance of military service. A person claiming discrimination by a federal executive agency in violation of section 4311(a) of USERRA may choose to submit a complaint directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b).[1] In order to establish that the Merit Systems Protection Board has jurisdiction over a USERRA discrimination claim, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that his military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the agency's action in question. <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Lourens v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;As an alternative to a direct complaint to the Board, an employee may elect to apply to the Secretary of Labor for assistance with his discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4322(a). The Secretary may attempt to resolve the matter or refer it to the Office of Special Counsel, which may assist the employee with his complaint before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4322(d), 4324(a). Mr. Kitlinski did not elect that option, but filed his complaint directly with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kitlinski's first claim is that the DEA discriminated against him in violation of USERRA section 4311(a) because of his military service. The problem with that claim, as the Board held, is that the agency's actions do not fit within the categories of actions that section 4311(a) prohibits an agency from taking, i.e., the denial of "initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only one of those prohibitions that Mr. Kitlinski argues is applicable in this case is the denial of a "benefit of employment." We agree with the Board, however, that the agency's alleged placement of the Blackberry in Mr. Kitlinski's car did not constitute the denial of a "benefit of employment" within the meaning of section 4311(a) of USERRA. This court has held that "a nexus between an allegedly-denied benefit and one's employment is an essential component of this type of USERRA claim." <span class="Italic">Thomsen v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 169 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). It would stretch the term "benefit of employment" far beyond its reasonable limits to construe it to mean freedom from any improper or unlawful acts committed by any representative of an employer outside the workplace, such as the alleged placement of a Blackberry in Mr. Kitlinski's vehicle while he was present at the DEA headquarters for a deposition.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Kitlinski cites several cases in which excessive monitoring of an employee was asserted as a basis for a claim of retaliation or a hostile work environment under other statutes. Those cases involved extended periods of monitoring in the workplace, quite different from the single instance of monitoring outside of the workplace that is alleged in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In his petition for review to the full Board, Mr. Kitlinski was critical of the administrative judge's characterization of the alleged placement of the Blackberry as lasting only a few hours on the morning of Mr. Kitlinski's deposition. In his narrative attachment to his complaint, however, Mr. Kitlinski specifically asserted that the "placement of the listening and tracking device occurred on the very day I was deposed by the Agency." It was therefore entirely reasonable for the administrative judge to accept Mr. Kitlinski's factual proffer on that issue as true.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the investigative measures taken by the OPR investigators cannot reasonably be characterized as the denial of a benefit of employment. While Mr. Kitlinski objects to the steps taken by the OPR investigators, including meeting Mr. Kitlinski at the Coast Guard headquarters and insisting that he produce the Blackberry and appear for an interview at the DEA headquarters the next day, those actions did not deny Mr. Kitlinski a benefit of employment under any reasonable definition of that term. That conclusion is confirmed by section 4303(2) of USERRA, which defines the term "benefit of employment" to mean the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" and benefits flowing therefrom.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kitlinski argues that the purpose of the Blackberry incident was to enable the DEA to obtain information to use in the legal proceedings he had brought against the agency, including his two prior USERRA claims. That contention, even if true, would not make freedom from monitoring outside the workplace a "benefit of employment" within the meaning of USERRA. The Board therefore correctly held that Mr. Kitlinski failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of acts of USERRA discrimination under section 4311(a) based on the Blackberry incident and the OPR investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Mr. Kitlinski's second claim is that the combination of the Blackberry incident and the DEA's subsequent investigation of that incident created a hostile work environment. He argues on appeal that the creation of a hostile work environment constituted discrimination based on his military service, in violation of USERRA section 4311(a), because it was motivated by anti-military animus. That claim, too, was properly rejected. As the Board observed, Mr. Kitlinski did not allege before the Board that the DEA created a hostile work environment because of his military service. Nor has Mr. Kitlinski pointed to any evidence of such a motivation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his brief, Mr. Kitlinski alludes to an attachment to his petition for review by the full Board, which he characterizes as reciting the "long standing number of disputes with the DEA," and detailing "repeated act[s] of discriminatory animus, denials of promotions and transfers, inaccurate responses to pointed Congressional inquiries, anti-military comments by the DEA Career Board, conflicting Agency explanations for its conduct and years long contests between Petitioner and the Agency over personnel actions taken or not taken." But a document describing Mr. Kitlinski's clashes with the agency is no substitute for an allegation of anti-military animus as the basis for creating a hostile work environment. The discrimination claim in the form of a hostile work environment based on military status therefore fails on that ground.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;Mr. Kitlinski's third claim is that the Blackberry incident and the subsequent OPR investigation constituted individual acts of retaliation against him because of his prior invocation of his rights under USERRA, and that those acts therefore violated section 4311(b), USERRA's anti-retaliation provision. The Board held that Mr. Kitlinski failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that either the Blackberry incident or the subsequent investigation qualified as an individual act of retaliation for his previous USERRA activities, and we agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA's prohibition against retaliation in section 4311(b) provides that an employer "may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person" because he has taken an action to enforce a protection provided by USERRA or has exercised a right provided for by USERRA. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). Thus, the anti-reprisal statute is limited to barring acts of discrimination in employment and adverse employment actions. <span class="Italic">See Lisdahl v. Mayo Found</span>., 633 F.3d 712, 721 (8th Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Crews v. City of Mt. Vernon</span>, 567 F.3d 860 (7th Cir. 2009).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As the <span class="Italic">Crews</span> court explained, the language of the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a) does not contain the limiting language found in section 4311(b) of USERRA; for that reason the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII has not been limited to employment-related actions. <span class="Italic">Crews</span>, 567 F.3d at 869.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board held, the Blackberry incident and the investigation that followed it do not constitute acts of "discrimination in employment" or "adverse employment actions." With respect to "discrimination in employment," the placement of a Blackberry in Mr. Kitlinski's car, as the Board found, "does not deny him a benefit that inures to him by virtue of his employment with the agency." Nor does that act constitute an "adverse employment action," which is generally defined to include actions adversely affecting the employee's employment status, such as firing, demotion, suspension, a loss of benefits, or a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, as the Board ruled, an investigation does not ordinarily constitute an act of "discrimination in employment" or an "adverse employment action." That is particularly clear in this case, as the investigation did not relate directly to Mr. Kitlinski's employment with the DEA. As the administrative judge pointed out, Mr. Kitlinski had been on long-term leave from the DEA while he served with the Coast Guard, and the investigation related to an incident that occurred at the time of his deposition in his EEO case against the agency. The investigation thus had no apparent effect on his employment with the DEA and did not constitute discrimination in employment or an adverse employment action. We therefore sustain the Board's ruling that Mr. Kitlinski failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the discrete actions about which he complains--the Blackberry incident and the investigative activities that followed--violated USERRA's anti-retaliation provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the ensuing Board decision denied relief to Mr. Kitlinski, explaining the basis for a hostile environment claim under USERRA and the need for a job-related personnel action, <span class="Italic">Kitlinski v. DOJ</span>, 2023 MSPB 13, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15 (2023)--"an appellant must nonfrivolously allege that he was subjected to a pattern of ongoing and persistent harassing behavior that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to amount to an 'adverse employment action' or 'discriminat[ion] in employment'":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we find that, considering the legislative history and <span id="Page_563"></span>remedial purpose of USERRA, it is appropriate to interpret USERRA's anti-retaliation provision as encompassing hostile work environment claims. The Board previously found that a hostile work environment claim may lie under USERRA's anti-discrimination provision, set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), to the extent that the creation of a hostile work environment amounts to the denial of a "benefit of employment." <span class="Italic">Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 227, 235-39 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, we determined that one of the basic purposes of USERRA is to prohibit discrimination because of an individual's service in the uniformed services, and that an expansive interpretation of the statute was intended by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 235-36. Further, we noted that the courts consistently have construed other anti-discrimination statutes as proscribing harassment in the workplace, and concluded that harassment on account of uniformed service, which is sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment, is a violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 237-39.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that USERRA's anti-retaliation provision similarly proscribes a hostile work environment. Section 4311(b) prohibits "discriminat[ion] in employment against" or "tak[ing] any adverse employment action against" individuals who engage in activity protected by that provision. In other words, an employer may not retaliate against an individual for exercising his rights under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Hayden</span>, 812 F.3d at 1362-63. Statutes should be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the intent of Congress. <span class="Italic">Hellebrand v. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 999 F.2d 1565, 1570-71 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The legislative history of USERRA explicitly states that it was intended "to prohibit discrimination or acts of reprisal" against individuals who file a complaint, assist in an investigation, or testify in a proceeding under that statutory scheme, and that USERRA is to be "liberally construed." H.R. Rep. No. 103-65(I), at 17, 19, 24 (1993), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2450, 2452, 2457. As the Federal Circuit has explained, any "interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran's favor." <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 846 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Brown v. Gardner</span>, 513 U.S. 115, 117-18 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion is confirmed by certain amendments to USERRA in 2011. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Carder v. United Airlines, Inc</span>., 636 F.3d 172 (5th Cir. 2011), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that USERRA did not create a cause of action based on a hostile work environment. Specifically, the court observed that "[i]n originally permitting a plaintiff to assert a hostile work environment claim in a Title VII case, the Supreme Court relied heavily on Title VII's language prohibiting discrimination with respect to the 'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.'" <span class="Italic">Carder</span>, 636 F.3d at 177 (citing <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 63-66 (1986)). However, this language was absent from USERRA, and the court found that its omission was intentional. The court therefore declined to read the USERRA term "benefits of employment" to encompass "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," and thus held that the plaintiff could not raise a hostile work environment claim under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 178-81. Eight months after the <span class="Italic">Carder</span> decision was issued, Congress clarified the term "benefits of employment" by amending 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2) to state specifically that it means "the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment." Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-56, &#x00A7; 251, 125 Stat. 711, 729. Based on Congress's legislative response to the <span class="Italic">Carder</span> decision, we find unambiguous congressional intent that hostile work environment claims be cognizable under USERRA</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we previously have recognized a prohibition against a retaliatory hostile work environment under the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, a statute that similarly prohibits retaliation for protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 23 (2015) (relying upon legislative history to broadly interpret a prohibition against retaliating for whistleblowing by making "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" to include harassment "that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing"), <span class="Italic">overruled in part by Pridgen v. Office of Management and Budget</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25. Additionally, Federal courts have concluded that hostile work environment claims are available under other similar anti-retaliation statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gowski v. Peake</span>, 682 F.3d 1299, 1311-12 (11th Cir. 2012) (recognizing the existence of retaliatory hostile work environment claims under Title VII for the first time in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and acknowledging that every other Federal circuit court already had recognized such claims); <span class="Italic">Floyd v. Lee</span>, 85 F. Supp. 3d 482 (D.D.C. 2015) (acknowledging the availability of a retaliatory hostile work environment claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act). Because many of the considerations underpinning the recognition of a hostile work environment claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), <span class="Italic">see Petersen</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 235-39, similarly exist for section 4311(b), we conclude that it is appropriate to permit hostile work environment claims under both USERRA's anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation statutes. Furthermore, the Federal Circuit in this matter at least implicitly concluded that a hostile work environment claim was cognizable under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b), as reflected in its remand of that claim to the Board for adjudication here. <span class="Italic">Kitlinski</span>, 857 F.3d at 1382.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that a hostile work environment claim is available under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b), we consider the appropriate standard for addressing such a claim. In determining what standard to apply to hostile work environment claims arising under USERRA's anti-discrimination provision, the Board recognized that courts that have considered this issue have looked to the elements of a hostile work environment claim under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Kitlinski</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">see Montoya v. Orange County Sheriff's Department</span>, 987 F. Supp.2d 981, 1012-15 (C.D. Cal. 2013). Applying those standards, the courts have held that, to establish such a claim, an employee must establish a "pattern of ongoing and persistent harassment severe enough to alter the conditions of employment," "prov[ing] that his workplace was both objectively and subjectively offensive" and that "any harassment took place on account of his protected status as a military member." <span class="Italic">Kitlinski</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 18 (quoting <span class="Italic">Montoya</span>, 987 F. Supp.2d at 1016-17, and citing <span class="Italic">Hanson v. County of Kitsap</span>, 21 F. Supp. 3d 1124, 1146-47 (W.D. Wash. 2014)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We similarly find here that Title VII provides a useful analog for establishing the elements of a USERRA hostile work environment claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). <span class="Italic">See Kitlinski</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 19. Accordingly, we hold that, to establish the Board's jurisdiction over a hostile work environment claim arising under USERRA's anti-retaliation provision, an appellant must nonfrivolously allege that he was subjected to a pattern of ongoing and persistent harassing behavior that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to amount to an "adverse employment action" or "discriminat[ion] in employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b); <span class="Italic">Montoya</span>, 987 F. Supp.2d at 1017; <span class="Italic">Kitlinski</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 19. An appellant also must nonfrivolously allege that his protected activity was a motivating factor in the alleged acts of hostility to bring the challenged conduct within the scope of USERRA's anti-retaliation provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(2) (stating that an employer violates section 4311(b) when an individual's protected activity is a "motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such person's enforcement action, testimony, statement, assistance, participation, or exercise of a right"); <span class="Italic">see also Hayden</span>, 812 F.3d at 1363 (setting forth the standard for establishing jurisdiction over a USERRA retaliation claim). In considering whether an appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he was subjected to a hostile work environment based on his protected activity under USERRA, we apply the Board's liberal approach to determining jurisdiction in a USERRA appeal, under which the relative weakness of an appellant's allegations concerning the seriousness of the alleged acts should not serve as a basis for jurisdictional dismissal. <span class="Italic">Swidecki v. Department of Commerce</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 6 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Federal Circuit found in this case, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) "is limited to barring acts of discrimination in employment and adverse employment actions." <span class="Italic">Kitlinski</span>, 857 F.3d at 1381. The appellant's retaliatory hostile work environment claim is grounded in two agency actions--the alleged planting of the Blackberry device in his vehicle and the OPR investigators summoning him to an interview. However, the Federal Circuit in its remand decision already concluded that these two actions did not constitute "adverse employment actions" or "discrimination in employment," as they did not deny the appellant "a benefit that inures to him by virtue of his employment with the agency." <span class="Italic">Kitlinski</span>, 857 F.3d at 1382. Concerning the interview, the court's finding was at least in part due to the fact that, at the time of the investigation in question, the appellant had been on long-term leave from his employing agency and was serving with the Coast Guard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Aggregating these two events in an effort to establish a hostile work environment claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) is unavailing--the two actions still had no bearing on the appellant's employment. Thus, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency discriminated in employment or took an adverse employment action against him, as required to establish jurisdiction over his retaliatory hostile work environment claim.</p>
