<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-82"><span class="space">c.</span> Significance of SF-50; Unclear Appointment Date</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the dispute is usually over the computation of the last day of the year-long probationary period that started on an undisputed date, there are appeals requiring the Board to determine when the appellant was actually appointed to and began his employment. Of significance is the effective date of the appointment, or start date, for the appellant, <span class="Italic">Calixto v. DOD</span>, 120 MSPR 557, 565-66 &#x00B6; 19, 2014 MSPB 7 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant argued below that she had completed 1 year of service as of the effective date of her termination on January 28, 2012, the appellant based her calculation upon the approval date for her appointment as reflected on her SF-50, January 27, 2011, rather than her effective start date, January 31, 2011. In interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), the Board has held that an appellant completed 1 year of current continuous service, thus satisfying the requirement for Board appeal rights, when she was separated after more than a year from the date on which she entered her position. <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. Department of State</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6; 13 (2006). The language requiring completion of 1 year of current continuous service is similar in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). Thus, because the appellant entered on duty on January 31, 2011, that is when her first year of service began. Accordingly, her first year of current continuous service would have concluded upon the end of her tour of duty on January 30, 2012. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 512, 514 n.2 (1997) (interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), the Board concluded that an appellant appointed to her position on October 16, 1993, completed 1 year of current continuous service on October 15, 1994), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part on other grounds on reopening</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46 (1998). The appellant's removal was effective as of January 28, 2012. The administrative judge, therefore, properly held that the appellant did not have 1 year of current continuous service as of the effective date of her termination in order to qualify as an employee under section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to SF-50 forms used to determine either appointment or termination, the operative date on the SF-50 is the effective date of an action, not the date that the SF-50 is issued. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hintz v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 F.3d 407, 410 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In <span class="Italic">Toyens v. DOJ</span>, 58 MSPR 634, 637 (1993), the employee was given a decision notice stating his termination was effective at noon on a particular date. The SF-50 documenting the termination did not set the time of termination. The appellant argued that the SF-50 controlled and that the termination time was midnight, past the completion of his shift on the final day of probation. The Board followed the decision notice and the actual course of the termination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]lthough the issuance of an SF-50 is the customary documentation for a personnel action, it does not effect the personnel action.... Rather, the decision notice approved by an individual with the proper authority effects the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[For additional discussion of 5 USC 2105, conditions of appointments, and the significance of the SF-50 form, refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-002.html#sec6-3">Cancelation of Appointment, Promotion</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-13-003.html#sec6-4">Appointment</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-13-004.html#sec6-5">Entry on Duty; Action by Appointing Authority; Reliance</a>; SF-50."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Durham v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3091), the initiation of probation is not controlled by the date the appellant steps across the threshold of the agency to enter on duty. Although the date on a SF-50 is not determinative, it is significant, for the SF-50 is indispensable to a valid appointment. The date shown on the form is to be taken into consideration along with other information in determining the date of the appointment. <span class="Italic">Hintz v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 F.3d 407, 409-10 (Fed. Cir. 1994), considered when the probationer, began performing a federal function under 5 USC 2105(a)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hintz first argues that his probationary period began when he attended meetings at the Salt Lake City MRR on September 28, 1991, because, as he asserts, he was asked to attend the MRR by Harding and he was introduced as the new SSA of the 321st Battalion while he was there. He reasons that the September 24, 1991, letter from Sardorus constituted an unconditional letter of appointment and that his participation at the MRR was the performance of a federal function under the authority of this appointment. We do not agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has provided the following definition of a federal employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of [Title 5], "employee," except as otherwise provided by this section or when specifically modified, means an officer and an individual who is--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;appointed in the civil service by one of the following acting in an official capacity--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(D)&#x2003;an individual who is an employee under this section;...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;engaged in the performance or a Federal function under authority of law or an Executive act; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;subject to the supervision of an individual named by paragraph (1) of this subsection while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 2105 (1988). Hintz must show that he satisfied all three requirements before his service and, it follows, his period of probation may be considered to have commenced. <span class="Italic">See Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 691 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("The elements have independent significance and are strictly applied.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to agree with Hintz that the September 24 letter conferred on him the status of a federal appointee,[2] we cannot agree that he was authorized to perform a federal function before October 7, 1991. "Appointee status, by itself, does not offer [an individual] any of the statutory protection due federal employees." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 246 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (Where plaintiffs received letters stating unconditionally that they had been selected for employment and should report for work on a certain date in the future, they nonetheless did not meet the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of 5 USC 2105(a)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The September 24 letter notified Hintz that "You have been selected and will enter the position on 10/7/91." However, the letter also stated that his appointment was "subject to receipt of DD214 &#x0026; reserve certification." Thus, at the earliest, Hintz's appointment would appear to have been effective only when the requested documents were received by the agency. Because we hold that <span id="Page_116"></span>Hintz was not authorized to enter on duty until October 7, however, we need not decide the precise date his appointment was effective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board examined the relevant documents to see when Hintz was authorized to assume his official duties; the official documents are dispositive. The September 24 letter specified that he would "enter the position on 10/7/91." His SF-50 specified an effective date of October 7, 1991, and twice stated that his appointment was subject to completion of a one year initial probationary period beginning on October 7, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board also found that both Harding and Stephenson told Hintz that he would assume his duties on October 7, and that he did not receive compensation for any activities before that date. The board's conclusion that Hintz's attendance at the MRR and early arrival at his office were insufficient to establish that he was authorized to assume his duties before October 7, in light of the other evidence of record, is supported by substantial evidence and is neither arbitrary nor capricious. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7703(c) (1988). The probationary period began on October 7, 1991.</p>

Dept. of Army,</span> DA-0752-10-0679-I-1 (NP 3/23/2012) (considering testimony and documentation to determine the date the appellant actually reported for work: "Moreover, based on long-held precedent, the Board has consistently held that '[t]he appointment of a federal employee cannot occur in the absence of the "last act" required by the person or body vested with appointment power.' <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hoever v.

Importantly, rather than relying solely on an SF-50, Notice of Personnel Action, the Board will examine the totality of the circumstances in order to determine if that crucial 'last act' has occurred. <span class="Italic">E.g., Hoever</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Scott v.

<p class="Body-Text">A letter confirming an appointment, issued before an SF-50, and before the appellant began his work, did not control the start of probation, <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cunningham, a veteran who was employed at the U.S. Postal Service from 1993 to 2000, applied to be an information technology specialist in the Bureau. On November 19, 2015, the acting chief of the Bureau's Branch of Workforce Staffing and Recruitment wrote Mr. Cunningham a letter "confirm[ing] [his] appointment" as an information technology specialist. The letter stated that the appointment was "contingent upon...receipt of all documents required for appointment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An SF 50 for the appointment was executed on December 13, 2015. The SF 50 stated that the appointment was "subject to [the] completion of [a] one year initial probationary period beginning" that day. There has been no showing that Mr. Cunningham started working in the job by carrying out the duties of the position before December 13, 2015.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 1, 2016, the Bureau terminated Mr. Cunningham's employment effective December 9, 2016, within the one-year probationary period....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cunningham was not an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) because, at the time of his termination, he was "serving a probationary...period under an initial appointment." &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). The information technology specialist position at issue--a competitive service position--required the successful applicant to undergo a one-year probationary period, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(1) (stating that the first year of service is probationary for successful applicants to competitive service positions). Mr. Cunningham does not dispute that the position required a one-year probationary period. Rather, Mr. Cunningham argues that he was "effectively" appointed to the position on November 20, 2015, the day after the November 19, 2015 letter. Thus, Mr. Cunningham continues, he was an employee under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) on the date of his termination because he had completed his one-year probationary period by then, indeed before the Bureau issued the notice of termination on December 1, 2016 (effective December 9, 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Cunningham is incorrect. "[A]ppointment is a single, discrete act," <span class="Italic">Skalafuris v. United States</span>, 683 F.2d 383, 386 (Ct. Cl. 1982), that occurs "when the last act, required from the person possessing the power [of appointment], has been performed," <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison</span>, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 157 (1803). Normally, the last act is the execution of an SF 50 or the administration of the oath of office. <span class="Italic">See Skalafuris</span>, 683 F.2d at 387 ("We have in past cases emphasized the importance of the SF-52, SF-50, and oath of office in determining the date or existence of an appointment...."); <span class="Italic">Vukonich v. Civil Service Commission</span>, 589 F.2d 494, 496 (10th Cir. 1978) ("[A]n appointment becomes effective only after a Standard Form 50, 'Notice of Personnel Action,' has been completed."); <span class="Italic">Costner v. United States</span>, 665 F.2d 1016, 1023 (Ct. Cl. 1981) ("[T]he lack of any evidence that [appellant] took an oath of office...rebut[s] his claim [of appointment].").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Cunningham's SF 50 was completed by the Bureau's director of human resources on December 13, 2015. Mr. Cunningham was therefore appointed to the position no earlier than December 13, 2015. <span class="Italic">See Skalafuris</span>, 683 F.2d at 387; <span class="Italic">Vukonich</span>, 589 F.2d at 496. To the extent that the author of the November 19, 2015 letter had the power of appointment, that letter itself makes clear that Mr. Cunningham's appointment was "contingent upon...receipt of all documents required for appointment," including the SF 50, <span class="Italic">Vukonich</span>, 589 F.2d at 496. And there is no basis for viewing the November 19, 2015 letter "as the 'last act' [of appointment] defined in" <span class="Italic">Marbury. Skalafuris</span>, 683 F.2d at 388 (quoting <span class="Italic">Marbury</span>, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) at 156). Further, Mr. Cunningham has not alleged, much less shown, that he carried out any duties of the information-technology-specialist position before December 13, 2015; accordingly, we have no occasion to consider the scope of our precedent indicating that a successful applicant's work carrying out duties of a position before the completion of the last act of appointment generally does not entitle the applicant to an appointment date earlier than the date of the last act of appointment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 385, 388-89 (holding that the plaintiff was appointed on March 5, 1974--the date on which the standard form 50 was executed--even though the plaintiff "was actively engaged in his new duties throughout February [1974]"). Thus, Mr. Cunningham was not appointed before December 13, 2015, so he was still in his one-year probationary period when his employment was terminated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ofili v. FHFB</span>, DC-315H-10-0754-I-1 (NP 4/26/2011), discussed what constitutes an appointment (and the entry date for purposes of probationary calculation):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues, as she did below, that the only issue is whether she completed her probationary period before her termination. The appellant maintains that her appointment began on July 14, 2009--the date she received an email from the hiring official (with proper hiring authority) acknowledging the appellant's acceptance of an offer of employment. The appellant further asserts that the email meets the two requirements for a valid appointment--an action by an authorized official making a knowing appointment to the civil service and the acceptance of the appointment by the appellant. Thus, the appellant maintains, her actual start date is irrelevant. The appellant's position is unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, the appellant's only cited authority for the proposition that her probationary period began on "appointment" is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.103. This regulation, however, is irrelevant to her appeal as it only applies to the National Security Personnel System. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.101, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Nothing in the Office of Personnel Management's relevant regulations suggests that time an individual (without prior federal service) spent waiting to begin a new position is somehow creditable for purposes of the required probationary period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the question of appointment, the appellant's entire claim hinges upon the email of July 14, 2009, from the Chief Human Capital Officer that congratulates the appellant on her selection for, and acceptance of, the Senior Examiner position. But the email, viewed in its entirety, fails to support the appellant's claim. In particular, the email specifically states that the appellant is required to serve a 1-year probationary period. Moreover, the email also emphasizes that the appellant cannot be "appointed to a federal position" until a background investigation is "initiated." The email further indicates that the appellant will receive further information regarding the completion of the background forms in a subsequent email. The appellant is further cautioned that she will not even be allowed admittance to the agency facility until she has transmitted all the forms necessary to initiate the investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to acceptance by the applicant, an appointment requires an "unequivocal" action by an authorized official appointing the appellant to the federal civil service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Watts v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 814 F.2d 1576, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Here, the email makes the appellant's actual "appointment" (and even admission to the building) entirely dependent on her future actions (regarding the background forms). Thus, the email, by its very terms, cannot constitute a formal appointment by the hiring official. Nor can the appellant claim that she became an "employee," pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105, on July 14, 2009, as she did not perform federal functions nor was she supervised by an appropriate federal official prior to August 3, 2009.<span class="Italic"> See generally Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 691 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not dispute that the appellant actually started work on August 3, 2009, her SF-50 shows an appointment date of August 3, 2009, she signed her appointment affidavit on August 3, 2009, and she went on the agency payroll on August 3, 2009. In addition, there is no dispute that the SF-50 stated that she was required to serve a probationary period that began on August 3, 2009. Accordingly, the appellant's probationary period began on August 3, 2009, and she was terminated during her probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Hintz v. Department of the Army</span>, 21 F.3d 407, 410 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the appellant's probationary period began when he reported for duty, not when he received the letter informing him that he had been selected for the position and directing him to report for duty);<span class="Italic"> Vandewall v. Department of Transportation</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 150, 152-53 (1991) (the appellant's probationary period began her first work day because <span id="Page_117"></span>she was not performing a federal function or supervised by a federal official prior to that date).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an SF-50 is significant, and it is relied on in appeals requiring calculation of an appointment date, more generally, the SF-50 does not control the underlying personnel action, <span class="Italic">Luna v. VA</span>, DA-1221-16-0223-W-2 (NP 4/12/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the Federal Circuit has stated, an SF-50 is not a personnel action in itself, but at most is merely an after-the-fact record of a personnel action already taken. <span class="Italic">Nasuti</span>, 376 F. App'x at 33; <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 8 (2010) (stating that, although the issuance of an executed SF-50 is the customary documentation for a Federal personnel action, it does not constitute the personnel action itself). Moreover, an SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights. <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 8 (citing <span class="Italic">Grigsby v.
