<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Minimum Requirements</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.111 (2022) defines the format of the initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The judge will prepare an initial decision after the record closes and will serve that decision on all parties to the appeal, including named parties, permissive intervenors, and intervenors of right. The Board satisfies its legal obligation under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(1) by making electronic copies of initial decisions available to the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Each initial decision will contain:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Findings of fact and conclusions of law upon all the material issues of fact and law presented on the record;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The reasons or bases for those findings and conclusions;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An order making final disposition of the case, including appropriate relief;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;A statement, if the appellant is the prevailing party, as to whether interim relief is provided effective upon the date of the decision, pending the outcome of any petition for review filed by another party under subpart C of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The date upon which the decision will become final (a date that, for purposes of this section, is 35 days after issuance); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;A statement of any further process available, including, as appropriate, a petition for review under &#x00A7; 1201.114 of this part, a petition for enforcement under &#x00A7; 1201.182, a motion for attorney fees under &#x00A7; 1201.203, a motion to initiate an addendum proceeding for consequential damages or compensatory damages under &#x00A7; 1201.204, and a petition for judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interim Relief</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2), if the appellant is the prevailing party, the initial decision will provide appropriate interim relief to the appellant effective upon the date of the initial decision and remaining in effect until the date of the final order of the Board on any petition for review, unless the judge determines that the granting of interim relief is not appropriate. The agency may decline to return the appellant to his or her place of employment if it determines that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly disruptive to the work environment. However, pay and benefits must be provided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An initial decision that orders interim relief shall include a section which will provide the appellant specific notice that the relief ordered in the decision must be provided by the agency effective as of the date of the decision if a party files a petition for review. If the relief ordered in the initial decision requires the agency to effect an appointment, the notice required by this section will so state, will specify the title and grade of the appointment, and will specifically advise the appellant of his right to receive pay and benefits while any petition for review is pending, even if the agency determines that the appellant's return to or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive.</p>

The requirements of Board regulations governing the content or format of initial decisions are not applicable to arbitration decisions ("awards") in actions that could have initially appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Webb v. Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 269 Fed. Appx. 977 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) [discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-12-257.html#sec5-256">Method and Scope of MSPB Reviews</a>"].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chapter 12 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> provides internal guidance to AJs concerning preparation and distribution of initial decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">GENERAL.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When a Decision Is Required</span>. Once a case has been docketed as an appeal, it must be closed by issuance of a decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Who May Issue</span>. The ID is issued by the AJ assigned to that case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(a). On an exceptional basis, however, in the AJ's absence, because the authority to adjudicate appeals is delegated from the Board through the RD or CAJ to the AJ, the RD or CAJ may sign the decision "for" the AJ, (or the decision may be signed with the name of the AJ "by" the RD or CAJ), even if the AJ has held a hearing on appeal. The delegation of signature authority does not extend beyond this to, for example, a fellow AJ or paralegal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time Frames</span>. Ideally, an ID should be issued within 120 days of the receipt of the appeal by the RO except for good cause shown. As noted previously, due process and fairness are paramount in determining good cause. Caseloads and the circumstances of the RO or AJ are also factors for consideration. In many instances, such factors can be ameliorated by shifting cases among AJs or between ROs. Also, as a result of the suspension provisions in the Board's regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.28 and chapter 3, section 12 of this Handbook, the parties may seek extended times for settlement and thereby move the case forward more quickly once it is returned to adjudication or as settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Citation to Transcripts, Tapes, CDs, and/or the Record</span>. The AJ must support his or her findings and conclusions in the ID with appropriate citations to the hearing tape(s)/CD(s). When an official transcript is available, the AJ may cite the transcript. If materials in the record are relied upon, the ID must cite them by tab number and, when the parties have complied with the direction in the acknowledgment order, by page number as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ORGANIZATION OF THE DECISION</span>. The ID should usually be divided into the following sections, with a liberal use of headings and subheadings to help the reader navigate the ID with ease. The following headings are suggestions and are not mandatory in every ID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Introduction</span>. This section must identify the following: The filing date of the petition, the agency (if not clear from the caption of the decision), the action appealed, the effective date of the action (or an indication that the appeal was timely filed), and the disposition of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the original appeal was rejected as defective, the original filing date will be in the main text of the introduction. The refiling date can be referenced in the main text or in a footnote.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Jurisdiction and/or Timeliness</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1).&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span>. If the appeal is clearly within the Board's jurisdiction, the ID must contain a brief statement to that effect, citing to appropriate authority, but it is not necessary to have a separate jurisdiction section of the ID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The ID must contain a full jurisdictional analysis under the following circumstances: (a) the appeal is not within the Board's jurisdiction; (b) the appeal is found to be within the Board's jurisdiction but involves an issue of first impression or one in which jurisdiction is unclear or contested; or (c) the appeal involves a question of the voluntariness of a resignation, retirement, etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2).&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timeliness</span>. Timeliness need not be addressed in detail unless the appeal presents a significant question about its timeliness. When the AJ has informed the parties of a question as to the timeliness of the appeal and sought their response, the ID should resolve the mater, even if the responses clearly show that the appeal was timely. If the record is sufficiently developed on the issue of timeliness or other grounds to show that an appeal should be dismissed on other than a jurisdictional basis, the AJ can properly determine, by assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, that dismissal of the appeal is warranted. Of course, such determination would be without actually making fact findings and conclusions of law on the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Popham v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 193 (1991). An appeal may not be dismissed as untimely before a finding of jurisdiction is made in constructive action appeals. In such cases, the agency is required to have notified the appellant of appeal rights only if it knew or should have known the appellant considered the apparently voluntary action to be involuntary. In such cases, the jurisdictional and timeliness issues are "inextricably intertwined"; that is, that resolution of the timeliness issue depends on whether the appellant was subjected to an appealable action. <span class="Italic">See Romine v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 68, 72-73 (1994); <span class="Italic">Popham, supra</span>, at 198 n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span>. A background section is used to explain the background of the case, unusual case processing, or prior appellate history. It should not analyze contested facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Findings</span>. This section includes a description of the parties' burdens of proof and a definition of the relevant legal standards. It also contains findings of facts and conclusions together with a thorough analysis explaining of the reasons for these findings and conclusions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1) and (2); <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587 (1980). When an appeal presents material credibility issues, the AJ must address them under the Board's guidance in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453 (1987). All material allegations raised by the parties, even if they are not reviewable by the Board, must be mentioned in the ID<span class="Italic">.</span> The AJ must adjudicate all allegations of discrimination, as well as all other prohibited personnel practices, within the Board's jurisdiction (identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)) even if the case is to be reversed on other grounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 14 (1988); <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 461 (1987). As stated above, in chapter 9, section 6b, all affirmative defenses that are raised must be addressed, whether on the merits or to note that they were withdrawn and will not be addressed further, or to find that they may not be addressed because the appeal is being dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">All elements of each party's burden of proof must also be addressed. In an adverse action case, for example, the AJ must make findings regarding whether the agency's penalty was reasonable and whether its action promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Decision</span>. This section sets forth the AJ's order as to the final disposition of the case, including appropriate relief. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(3)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">f.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Order</span>. If required, the AJ must specify the corrective action to be taken by the agency and the timeframe within which it must be completed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">g.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Finality Date</span>. The AJ or the support person who closes out the case must include in the ID the specific finality date. Although the notice of the parties' rights informs them of the 35-day deadline for filing a PFR, a specific date is less ambiguous, and therefore less subject to misinterpretation, especially by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(5). Although the failure to include a finality date may in certain circumstances be deemed to be harmless error, <span class="Italic">see Upshaw v. Department of Defense,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 94, 97 (1992),<span class="Italic"> aff'd</span> 5 F.3d 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table), the absence of a finality date, combined with other factors, may be good cause for waiver of the PFR filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Hamner v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">h.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interim Relief</span>. If the appellant in an appeal governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 is the prevailing party, the ID should provide interim relief, if appropriate, effective upon the date of the ID and remaining in effect until the date of the final order of the Board on any PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(4) and (c). Interim relief rarely is granted in retirement cases. <span class="Italic">See Steele</span> <span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 458 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 50 F.3d 21 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). If the AJ has determined that interim relief should not be <span id="Page_1605"></span>granted, the ID should contain a concise statement of his or her reasoning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">i.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Signature</span>. Each ID must be signed by the AJ (or by the RD or CAJ for the AJ), as discussed in section 1b, above. The signature must be preceded by the phrase, "For the Board," in either event.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In cases in which the parties are served electronically, the ID, as well as any Order, Notice, or other document sent by the AJ should be "signed" /s/. For an actual signature to be transmitted electronically, the signed document would have to be scanned, making the electronic file larger and the document more difficult to deal with. While it is anticipated that e-signatures will be used at some point, for now the technology to make them a reality is lacking. Nonetheless, the copy of the document that goes into the paper record, if the official record is paper, should be signed in the usual manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">j.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Review Rights</span>. Each ID must contain the appropriate standardized closing paragraphs. This includes notice of both the parties' right to file a petition for review with the Board and the appellant's right to seek judicial review. While the standard notice of judicial review rights used to inform the appellant of only mixed or nonmixed appeal rights, and whistleblower or non-whistleblower rights, current practice is to set out a summary of all available appeal rights, but not provide legal advice on which option is most appropriate for any individual case or specify how courts will rule regarding which cases fall within their jurisdiction. Thus, all decisions now contain the same notice, regardless of the issues that were raised on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">k.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Referral to Special Counsel</span>. In IRA appeals, the case must be referred to OSC if whistleblower retaliation has been found. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(f)(3). However, the referral will be done by OCB so that the ROs have no obligation to track the finality of any such cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 15, section 8 of this Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">l.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sensitive Security Information (SSI)</span>. Decisions that may contain SSI may be issued to the parties but must not be distributed beyond them until they have been cleared by the Department of Homeland Security. Further, they may not be served by e-Appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 17, sections 4-5. The AJ must follow the internal procedures for SSI. Cases involving similar types of information that the agency may wish to keep out of general circulation should be raised to OCB, and ORO simultaneously should be informed, although secrecy cannot be guaranteed absent a legal</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">prohibition on dissemination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">QUALITY REVIEW OF DECISIONS</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pre-Issuance Review</span>. Each ID written by an AJ at the GS-14 grade level or below must be reviewed prior to issuance by the CAJ (or designee). IDs written by GS-15 AJs in complex cases must be reviewed prior to issuance by the CAJ (or designee). Other IDs written by GS-15 AJs must be reviewed post-issuance. In addition, Insta-Cite of citations contained in the ID must be completed in accordance with the policy of the RD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Erratum Notices</span>. After an ID is issued, an AJ's authority to alter the decision is severely circumscribed. The Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.112 specifies that an AJ retains jurisdiction only to (1) correct the transcript; (2) rule on a request by the appellant for attorney fees, consequential damages, or compensatory damages; (3) process a petition for enforcement; and (4) vacate an initial decision before it becomes final in order to accept a settlement agreement into the record. However, an AJ may correct a nonsubstantive mistake, one that is simply editorial in nature, by issuance of an Erratum notice. A few examples of such mistakes include: a misspelling of the appellant's name or other mistake in the caption (e.g., a wrong docket number); an incorrect case citation; the omission of a word; a mathematical miscalculation; a misstatement of the nature of the action or of the penalty imposed; a wrong or missing closing paragraph; or an incorrectly computed finality date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The regulation provides that the AJ's authority to take the four specified actions does not affect the finality of the ID or the PFR filing period. Nevertheless, if the AJ believes that the correction might be cause for the appellant to file a PFR (e.g., a $50,000.00 payment was corrected to read $50.00, or that the insertion of the word "no" made a significant outcome difference, etc.), then it should be brought to the appellant's attention that the Erratum notice might be good cause for a late PFR filing or amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DISTRIBUTION OF DECISIONS.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">To Interested Parties</span>. Copies of the decision must be mailed--or e-mailed to e-filers--to the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Appellant;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Appellant's Representative;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Agency's Representative;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Intervenors; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;OPM. Electronic copies of IDs will be made available to OPM on the Board's Extranet list serv.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">To MSPB Headquarters</span>. AJs must save the ID in the Document Management System (DMS) so that it can be distributed electronically both within and outside of the Board by OCB. AJs are responsible for proper distribution of the ID to the parties. OCB is responsible for proper distribution of the ID to all other entities as required (e.g., OPM, OSC, etc.). An issuance date should not be filled in until the ID is, indeed, ready for issuance, to avoid premature release of a document that may be changed before issuance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Certification of Service</span>. Each ID must be accompanied by the appropriate standardized certificate of service. The certificate will contain each party's postal mailing address but must indicate the method by which service was actually accomplished, i.e., Regular Mail, Electronic Mail, etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Federal Circuit Notice</span>. The Clerk of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has prepared notices that must be served with every ID on appellants who appeared <span class="Italic">pro se</span> before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">RULES OF CITATION</span>. An AJ generally must follow the "Blue Book" rules of citation, except when citing those Board decisions that contain paragraph numbers by including those numbers rather than the pages on which they appear. Board policy is that nonprecedential Final Orders and Remand Orders, IDs, and unpublished court opinions are not precedential. The Federal Circuit's nonprecedential decisions may be cited for their persuasive authority. Brief orders that summarily deny the petition but also summarily rule on timeliness questions or pending motions also are not precedential. Accordingly, these decisions and opinions generally should not be cited as authority in an ID. However, an AJ may cite to and follow a Board nonprecedential decision, as the Board cites to the Federal Circuit's nonprecedential decisions, if the AJ finds its analysis persuasive. An AJ may not cite as controlling cases when a majority of the Board does not vote to adopt the analysis of an O&#x0026;O.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">STYLE</span>. The AJ must maintain a dignified, judicial tone in the decision and avoid <span class="Italic">ad hominem</span> attacks on any persons discussed in the ID.</p>
