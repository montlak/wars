<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-237"><span class="space">b.</span> Restraint on Employee Communication With OSC, Congress</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. John Does 1-4 v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, CB-1208-13-0011-U-1 (NP 11/29/2012), the Special Counsel sought and obtained an initial stay against the continuation of an agency's threat to officially document unsatisfactory employee appraisals if they complained to OSC or to Congress:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its November 26, 2012 stay request, OSC alleges that the four affected individuals (hereinafter "Former Employees") previously worked in the agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG). OSC asserts that three of the Former Employees are current federal employees. As alleged by OSC, the three highest officials in OIG, consisting of the Inspector General (IG), the Deputy IG and Counsel to the IG (Deputy IG), and the Principal Assistant IG for Investigations (PAIGI), coerced the Former Employees to sign nondisclosure agreements in an effort to chill the Former Employees from whistleblowing, cooperating with OSC, and reporting wrongdoing to the United States Congress. Specifically, OSC alleges that, from 2010 to 2011, the IG, Deputy IG, and/or the PAIGI issued a failing performance appraisal to each of the Former Employees. Based on the timing and the content of the performance appraisals, OSC asserts that the appraisals did not reflect an honest assessment of each employee's performance. OSC asserts that each of the Former Employees had worked in OIG for several years but was actively seeking employment elsewhere, as was known by the IG, Deputy IG, and/or the PAIGI. In addition, OSC alleges that each of the Former Employees had received superior performance evaluations in previous years and had recently received at least a satisfactory appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to OSC, immediately after the IG, Deputy IG, and/or the PAIGI issued the failing performance appraisals to each of the Former Employees, the IG, Deputy IG, and/or the PAIGI presented each employee with the allegedly unlawful nondisclosure agreement and stated that, if the employee signed the agreement, the failing performance appraisal would not go into the employee's Official Personnel Folder (OPF) and the agency would provide prospective employers with a neutral job reference. OSC further asserts that, if the employee did not sign the agreement, however, the IG, Deputy IG, and/or the PAIGI threatened to put the failing performance appraisal into the employee's OPF and notify the employee's new employer about the failing performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC alleges that the nondisclosure agreement provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Employee] further agrees:...not to disparage the Agency in any communications to any person or entity, including but not limited to Members of Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, and the media. However, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or inhibit [Employee] from responding truthfully to direct questions posted to him in writing or in the course of a formal hearing before any legislative, executive, or judicial body;...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The parties agree that this Agreement...shall not be used, cited, or relied upon by any party in connection with any other judicial or administrative proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Employee] and the Agency agree to keep the nature and terms of this Agreement confidential. The terms of the Agreement may not be disclosed to any person or entity beyond the persons signing below and those persons and entities represented by the persons signing below, except as required by law, as necessary to implement the terms of the Agreement, or as ordered by a court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the event that [Employee] exercises his right to revoke this Agreement in writing during the revocation period contemporary with or after his transfer from employment with the OIG, the OIG will deliver a full accounting of [the Employee's] performance over the last performance year to his new employer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC alleges that the nondisclosure agreements are chilling the Former Employees from whistleblowing, filing complaints with OSC, cooperating in an OSC investigation, and exercising their right to petition Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC "may request any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 days if the [OSC] determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(i). Such a request "shall" be granted "unless...such a stay would not be appropriate." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(ii). The statute thus sets up a presumption that 0 SC's request for an initial stay will be granted, and it makes OSC the lead actor in securing provisional relief when, in OSC's judgment, an agency may have committed a prohibited personnel practice. OSC's stay request need merely fall within the "range of rationality" to be granted, and "the facts should be viewed in the light which is most favorable to a finding of reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice was (or will be) committed." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Perfetto v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 169, &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">accord Special Counsel ex rel. Aran v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC alleges that the agency took or threatened to take personnel actions against the Former Employees because of their perceived whistleblowing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Under section 2302(b)(8), an agency may not take or threaten to take certain personnel actions against an employee because of a protected whistleblowing disclosure. Generally, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) exists when: (1) The employee made a protected disclosure; (2) the official(s) who recommended, took, or threatened the personnel action had actual or constructive knowledge of the protected disclosure; (3) a personnel action was taken or not taken or threatened to be taken or not taken; and (4) the protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the challenged personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Office of Special Counsel ex rel. Hopkins v. Department of Transportation</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 4 (2001). The Board has recognized, however, that an individual who is perceived as a whistleblower is still entitled to the protections of the Whistleblower Protection Act, even if that individual has not made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, 'VII 6, 7-8 (2011). Under these circumstances, the Board will focus its analysis on the agency's perceptions, i.e., whether the agency officials involved in the personnel actions at issue believed that the appellant made or intended to make disclosures that evidenced the type of wrongdoing listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC contends that, although the Former Employees have not made protected disclosures themselves, they nevertheless satisfy the first element because the agency believed that the Former Employees might make protected disclosures, file complaints, or cooperate with OSC. Stay Request File (citing <span class="Italic">King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8). According to OSC, the IG, Deputy IG, and/or the PAIGI gave the employees failing performance appraisals, and threatened to make them part of their OPFs and forward them to new employers, in order to coerce them into signing the nondisclosure agreement. OSC contends that the nondisclosure agreements are chilling the Former Employees from whistleblowing, filing complaints with OSC, cooperating with OSC, and exercising their right to petition Congress. OSC further implies that the perceived whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the alleged personnel actions because the agency would not have taken the personnel actions but for the Former Employees' perceived whistleblowing activities. Given the deference that should be afforded OSC and the assertions made by OSC in its stay request, I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the agency took or threatened to take these actions against the Former Employees because of their perceived whistleblowing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 7-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4067"></span>I further find that it is within the range of rationality to believe that the alleged actions could constitute "personnel actions" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). Based on OSC's assertions, the threat of issuing a failing performance appraisal constitutes a threat to take a "personnel action" against the Former Employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(viii); <span class="Italic">see Schlosser v. Department of the Interior</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 15, 22 (1997). With respect to the alleged significant change in working conditions, OSC contends that the nondisclosure agreements impose a significant change by restraining the Former Employees from: (1) making a protected disclosure to any entity, including Congress, OSC, or the press; (2) cooperating with or disclosing information to OSC; and (3) exercising their right to petition Congress. OSC argues that a significant change in working conditions should include any harassment that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing. (citing <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 583, &#x00B6; 15 n.4 (2010)). For purposes of this nonprecedential single-member decision in this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> proceeding, I accept OSC's assertion that the Former Employees' inability to report perceived wrongdoing to the appropriate authorities as a result of signing the nondisclosure agreement may constitute a "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC alleges that it has reasonable cause to believe that the agency has taken, or will take, personnel actions against the Former Employees in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). Under section 2302(b)(9), an employee who has the authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action shall not, with respect to such authority, take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee because of, among other things, the employee's cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C). Generally, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) exists when: (1) The employee engaged in a protected activity; (2) the employee was subsequently treated adversely; (3) the acting official had actual or imputed knowledge of the protected activity; and (4) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel ex rel.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OSC has generally argued that the Former Employees have been chilled from, among other things, cooperating with OSC or otherwise participating in its Ongoing Investigation.

Given the deference that should be afforded OSC and the assertions made by OSC in its stay request, I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the agency took or threatened to take these personnel actions against the Former Employees in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12)</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC alleges that the agency took or threatened to take the actions in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12). Under section 2302(b)(12), it is a prohibited personnel practice to "take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title." One of the merit system principles states that "[e]mployees should be protected against reprisal for the lawful disclosure of information which the employees reasonably believe evidences...a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or...mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC contends that the two personnel actions the agency took or threatened to take violate the Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211, and annual appropriations law, citing Pub. L. No. 112-74, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Section 715, made current through March 27, 2012, through Pub. L. No. 112-175. OSC contends that the nondisclosure agreements violate the Lloyd-LaFollette Act because they interfere with the Former Employees' right to petition Congress, and violate annual appropriations law because they do not contain express language to inform the employees that the agreement's restrictions do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter an employee's rights under sections 2302(b)(8) and 7211 of Title 5 of the United States Code. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the deference that should be afforded OSC and the assertions made by OSC in its stay request, and considering that the Lloyd-LaFollette Act and annual appropriations law may arguably implement, or directly concern, the merit system principle found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(9), I find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the agency took or threatened to take actions in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above analysis, I find that it is appropriate to order a stay under the terms set forth below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Order below does not operate with respect to any of the Former Employees who are not employed by an "agency" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C). Extending the Order to individuals who are not employed by an "agency" "would not be appropriate," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(ii), because such individuals are not protected from allegedly retaliatory acts taken after they leave government employment. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 9 (2010); <span class="Italic">Pasley v.

Individuals not employed in an "agency" may seek relief for acts of retaliation taken against them while they were employed in an "agency," <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), but OSC does not ask for relief for such acts in this proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its stay request, OSC additionally asks the Board to find the nondisclosure agreements void and unenforceable. It also seeks to nullify the nondisclosure agreements not only with respect to the Former Employees, but also with respect to all former OIG employees subject to a nondisclosure agreement. This requested relief is beyond the scope of the relief I am able to grant in the context of an initial stay request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(B), OSC further requests that the Board issue a protective order to protect the Former Employees against any enforcement of their nondisclosure agreements and any other retaliatory harassment. I have not been designated to rule on this request, however, and the matter has been separately docketed and referred to the full Board for decision. <span class="Italic">See Office of Special Counsel ex rel.
