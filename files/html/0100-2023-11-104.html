<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-105"><span class="space">H.</span> FOIA; PRIVACY ACT AND PRIVACY INTERESTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">If a union uses the Freedom of Information Act, it will be charged search and copy fees, it will have an appeal within the agency, and it will have access to federal district court should it desire to litigate the denial of information. If the agency claims that the release of information under FOIA would invade personal privacy, the union will be called on to provide an explanation or justification for its request so that the agency may conduct a balancing test in order to determine whether the release of information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. If a request for information is made under &#x00A7; 7114, there are no search and copy fees. If the request is denied by the agency, the remedy is a ULP charge with FLRA. Issuance of a complaint is within the discretion of the FLRA. There is no direct access to court for the union prior to issuance of a ULP complaint and an FLRA decision on the complaint. A union may also grieve and arbitrate a denial of information if it decides to forego the ULP route.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union chooses to seek information under the FOIA rather than under &#x00A7; 7114, it cannot complain if management treats the union as a member of the public by charging search and copying fees in accordance with schedules applicable to all FOIA public requests. A prior fee policy did not become a condition of employment because the union used the FOIA like any other member of the public. <span class="Italic">U.S. Forces Korea, Eighth Army and NFFE Local 1363</span>, 15 FLRA 373, 381 (1984) (ALJ Decision). A union could not negotiate for a blanket waiver of FOIA fees, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Dept. of Military Affairs, Springfield</span>, 39 FLRA 1087, 1096 (1991) (Proposal 4):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's policy regarding fees for FOIA requests is not a matter pertaining to the conditions of employment of unit employees within the meaning of section 7103 (a) (14) of the Statute.. . . Specifically, an agency's "policy regarding fees for FOIA requests did not become a condition of employment simply because the [union], having itself elected to seek information under the FOIA and consequently been treated as part of the general public, also happens to have been the exclusive representative for a unit of the [agency's] employees.". . . In this respect, therefore, the Union herein stands in no different relationship to the Agency under the FOIA than any other member of the public requesting information under that statute. Consequently. . .because Proposal 4 constitutes a waiver of fees on the part of the Agency for the costs of information provided to the Union under the FOIA, we conclude that the proposal does not concern conditions of employment of unit employees and is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The union may make requests under both &#x00A7; 7114 and FOIA. Procedurally, it is immaterial that a letter denying information to a union noted the availability of an appeal to some higher agency official. Section 7116(d) of the statute, providing an election between ULP and statutory appeals systems, contemplates that an appeals procedure will not encompass those procedures providing no third-party review of an agency action. An inter-agency appeal is not third-party review. <span class="Italic">VARO, Denver and AFGE Local 1557</span>, 7 FLRA 629, 639 (1982). Although the union may use FOIA, it need not do so; a request for information by the exclusive representative will require the agency and FLRA to conduct the balancing test described by the cases that follow. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 32 FLRA 133, 138-39 (1988). Under decisions in the discussion that follows, the union may request information under &#x00A7; 7114 and the agency may claim that the information cannot be released because of the Privacy Act, but the Authority (and the agency) will (or should) consider the FOIA exemptions under the Privacy Act to determine if materials are to be released under &#x00A7; 7114. To obtain the analysis of FOIA concerning a request under &#x00A7; 7114, the union need not invoke FOIA. It is sufficient for the union to make the request under &#x00A7; 7114. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Warren AFB and AFGE Local 2354</span>, 44 FLRA 452, 454 (1992). Under <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Louisville</span>, 45 FLRA 1346, 1352-53 (1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>, the same balancing test must be applied in cases involving the review of negotiated provisions that is applied in resolving disputes resulting from a request for data under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the statute. If the union obtains the consent of employees for release of records covering them, the Privacy Act analysis becomes moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, MacDill AFB and NFFE Local 153</span>, 51 FLRA 1144, 1150 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">Times were that a request for information under &#x00A7; 7114 created a greater entitlement than one under FOIA. An employer could not treat a union's request for information pertaining to a grievance as one under FOIA, as though it came from a member of the public. Did Congress intend, under the Privacy Act, to preclude disclosure of data to a union under a negotiated agreement? The union occupied a unique position and needed relevant materials to fulfill its representational duties. <span class="Italic">BATF, Nat'l Office and NTEU</span>, 8 FLRA 547, 556-57 (1982) (ALJ Decision) (relying on <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2047 v. Defense Gen. Supply Ctr.</span>, 423 F. Supp. 481 (E.D. Va. 1976)). However, the decisions that follow show that federal agencies frequently and effectively interpose the Privacy Act to bar disclosure in response to requests for information under &#x00A7; 7114, requiring FLRA to make determinations through ULP proceedings concerning the extent of permissible disclosures. Now the union enjoys no special status as a requestor if the information requested, even as to those individuals represented by the union, falls within the antidisclosure provisions of FOIA and the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, MacDill AFB and NFFE Local 153</span>, 51 FLRA 1144, 1153 (1996). Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, New York TRACON, Westbury and NATCA</span>, 50 FLRA 338, 347-48 (1995), a ULP case, the test that is now applied to union information requests that implicate privacy interests is a FOIA standard: the determinative issue when considering the privacy interests of individuals as to whom information is requested is whether those interests are outweighed by the public (not necessarily the same as the union's) ability to better determine what the government "is up to" through the disclosure of the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent">The interplay among &#x00A7; 7114, the Privacy Act (5 USC 552a), and FOIA (5 USC 552), was, and remains, the subject of controversy before the Authority. Section 7114 allows the union access to information that is normally maintained by the agency and is reasonably available and necessary for collective bargaining and related activities, with a condition--that the disclosure not be prohibited by law. The Privacy Act generally precludes the release of information concerning individuals from agency files, with a number of exceptions. Exceptions include disclosures compelled by FOIA and disclosures to "routine users." FOIA compels disclosure of information from federal files, but prohibits disclosure of information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. To ensure that &#x00A7; 7114 disclosures are not prohibited by the Privacy Act or FOIA, FLRA construes the privacy interests protected by FOIA and the Privacy Act. To determine whether the "routine use" exception is available, the Authority reviews, but will not second-guess, the contents of the records notice describing the routine uses of the system of records containing materials sought by the union. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp. and NATCA Y90 Local</span>, 47 FLRA 110, 143 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is unlikely that an agency waives a Privacy Act bar to the release of covered records by not initially raising the statute in response to an information request. <span class="Italic">HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 56 FLRA 503, 506 (2000), explained at note 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of our determination, we do not address whether the Respondent was precluded from raising the Privacy Act defense for the first time at the hearing. We note, however, that it appears clear that an agency cannot <span id="Page_359"></span>waive the Privacy Act rights of its employees regarding the release of personal information. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D) (employee authorized to bring private civil action against agency for violation of agency provision that adversely affects the employee, such as unauthorized disclosure of employee's personal information, prohibited under &#x00A7; 552a(b)).</p>
<p class="noindent">As an example of the complexities of the interrelation of the statutes, a union that sought information under FOIA could not compel bargaining that would require an agency to ignore restrictions under the Privacy Act relating to release under FOIA, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Dept. of Military Affairs, Springfield</span>, 39 FLRA 1087, 1091-92 (1991) (Proposal 1):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The objective of the FOIA is full disclosure of information in records maintained by an agency unless that information is exempted from disclosure....&#8197;The FOIA authorizes agencies to refuse to disclose certain information described in the exemptions, but it does not prohibit the disclosure of that information. Thus, under the FOIA, there are two broad classes of information: (1) that which must be disclosed; and (2) that which may be disclosed or may be withheld from disclosure. Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA provides that information contained in personnel files (as well as medical and other similar files) may be withheld if disclosure of the information would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act, on the other hand, generally prohibits the disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b). Section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act provides, however, that the prohibition against disclosure is not applicable if disclosure of the information would be required under the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, if information is of the type that could be exempted from disclosure by FOIA Exemption (b)(6), that information would not be required to be disclosed under the FOIA, and, therefore, section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act would not apply. Accordingly, that information would be subject to the general Privacy Act prohibition of the disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 would require the Agency to furnish information to the Union under the FOIA to the extent that providing the information is not prohibited by law.&#x2003;The proposal also states, however, that the Union retains its right as the exclusive representative to obtain relevant data/information notwithstanding the existence of the Privacy Act. Inasmuch as the FOIA does not prohibit the disclosure of information, the effect of the first and second sentences of the proposal, read together, would be to require the Agency to release information to the Union under the FOIA that would otherwise be precluded from release by the Privacy Act. For example, the proposal would require the release of information for which disclosure was barred by the Privacy Act because, under the FOIA, that disclosure would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the plain wording of the proposal--"not withstanding [sic] the existence of the Privacy Act"--is inconsistent with the Union's statement that the proposal would not require the Agency "to abdicate any legal responsibility." Because the proposal would require the Agency to provide the Union with information that may not be released under the Privacy Act without an employee's consent, we find that the proposal is inconsistent with law and nonnegotiable....</p>
<p class="noindent">The law develops on a case-by-case basis as FLRA attempts to determine the intent of information requests, the scope of records system notices, the public interest served by disclosure, and the possible impact of disclosure on employees. The resulting decisions are elaborate, sometimes speculative. Privacy interests are weighed according to uncertain standards.</p>
<p class="noindent">The potential for stigmatization of employees is a factor in the privacy analysis, as in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr. and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 37 FLRA 987, 997 (1990) (list of military personnel who have been assigned TDY would not be stigmatizing or embarrassing), but privacy interests also extend to nonstigmatizing information (e.g., home addresses). The likelihood of dissemination is another factor that is taken into account in the privacy equation. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv. and Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org.</span>, 38 FLRA 120, 135 (1990), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Commerce, NOAA</span>, 962 F.2d 1055, 1059-60 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, New York TRACON, Westbury and NATCA</span>, 50 FLRA 338, 349-50 (1995) (discussed, <span class="Italic">post</span>, as to release of unsanitized appraisals); <span class="Italic">NLRB, Office of Gen. Counsel and NLRB Union</span>, 37 FLRA 1036, 1085 (1990) (exceptions to arbitration award: limited disclosure of nonstigmatizing information in form of appraisal comments furthered public interest of ensuring that government fairly evaluates individuals for promotions and performance awards).</p>
<p class="noindent">For a summary of the balancing tests described by FLRA, interconnecting the Privacy Act and FOIA with &#x00A7; 7114, refer to <span class="Italic">VAMC, Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 32 FLRA 133, 139-40 (1988). The developing law distinguishes between requests for redacted (sanitized) and unredacted (unsanitized) information. If the union's information request (or proposal for information disclosure) calls only for unsanitized information, FLRA will consider whether sanitized information was improperly withheld only if that issue was charged in the complaint or fully litigated below. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Wash., DC and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 468 n.6 (1995); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, MacDill AFB and NFFE Local 153</span>, 51 FLRA 1144, 1157 (1996) (no ULP when the agency denied the union's request for unsanitized performance appraisals and supervisory work folders).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a ULP case involving alleged improper denial of information, FLRA may examine the record to ensure the agency properly preserved and supported its objection to disclosure based on the Privacy Act. That review occurred in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Marion and AFGE Local 2343</span>, 66 FLRA 669, 673-74 (2012), involving the agency's refusal to disclose unsanitized material about misconduct investigations that included information about employees other than the grievant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding that the Respondent violated the Statute when it failed to furnish the SIS, OIA, and FBI reports, the Judge assessed whether, "at or near the time of the Union's request," the Respondent had adequately met its burdens under <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 50 FLRA at 345. He did not resolve whether the Privacy Act prohibited disclosure of the disputed reports or whether furnishing the reports was "prohibited by law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Respondent's statements in its reply to the Union's request were adequate to require the Judge to resolve that issue. In this connection, the Authority has addressed the merits of a "prohibited by law" claim when a respondent's reply to a union summarily cited the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Austin</span>, 51 FLRA at 1168, 1176-77; <span class="Italic">cf. U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Acad., Colo. Springs, Colo.,</span> 59 FLRA 888, 893 (2004) (then-Member Pope dissenting on another matter) (Authority addressed the merits of a "prohibited by law" claim when a respondent's reply to a union summarily cited an agency regulation). Similarly, the Authority has addressed and resolved Privacy Act allegations based on a respondent's claim in its answer to the complaint that the information "may not be available in accordance with the Privacy Act," and when "throughout the proceeding [it] invoked the Privacy Act as a basis for not disclosing the requested information in an unsanitized form."[9] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Dallas, Tex., </span>51 FLRA 945, 952, 961 (1996) (<span class="Italic">VAMC</span>). The Authority also has addressed and resolved Privacy Act allegations based on a respondent's invoking "prior to the [j]udge's decision...Privacy Act concerns" and presenting testimony at the hearing connecting the requested information and the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Waco Distrib. Ctr., Waco, Tex., </span>53 FLRA 749, 756-57 (1997). The <span class="Italic">FAA </span>framework does not establish the burdens that a respondent must meet in its reply to a union's information request; it is about the burdens that an agency must meet before the <span class="Italic">Authority</span>, as evidenced by the fact that it discusses shifting the burden to the GC. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 345.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note that, in this case, the Union did not request sanitized reports and there is no claim that, at or near the time of its request, the Union informed the Respondent that it would accept sanitized reports.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is not disputed that the Judge found that the Respondent claimed in its reply to the information request that the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of the specified reports. In addition, unlike <span class="Italic">Fed Det. Ctr.</span>, where the respondent raised the Privacy Act for the first time in its post-hearing brief to the Judge, the Respondent referenced its reply in its answer to the complaint and invoked the Privacy Act throughout the proceedings before the Judge. The Respondent also presented testimony at the hearing invoking the Privacy Act, and the GC acknowledged and disputed the Privacy Act claim. And in its arguments and presentation of testimony, the Respondent made clear its position that the Privacy Act prohibited disclosure of the reports because disclosure would reveal the names of the correctional officers who, in addition to the grievant, were investigated for misconduct. It also is clear that, in the ULP proceedings before the Judge, the Union and the GC understood that the Respondent's position regarding the Privacy Act was based on a claim that the reports named those other employees who were investigated for misconduct.</p>
