<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-105"><span class="space">e.</span> Identity of Prior Issue; Ability Earlier to Raise an Issue</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 194, 199 (1994), an appeal involving arguably conflicting interpretations by a district court and the Board concerning the appellant's right to a particular seniority date, explained that collateral estoppel depends on an identity of issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge correctly denied collateral estoppel effect to the district court's summary order enforcing the arbitration award. As he noted, the agency failed to show that the issue in the district court proceeding was identical to the issue here, which is whether the agency is bound by its previous agreements to afford the appellant the 1966 seniority date. There is no evidence that the district court considered the Compensation Act or the provisions of the agreements between the appellant and the agency settling her claim under the Act. Indeed, as the administrative judge noted, counsel for the agency conceded in an earlier proceeding in this case that the district court judge stated from the bench that the propriety of the agreement settling the Board proceedings was not before him. In addition, the arbitrator whose decision the court's order enforces stated in his decision that he lacked jurisdiction to resolve the conflict between the settlement agreement and the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dolinsky v. DHS</span>, 372 Fed. Appx. 85, 88 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (in an IRA case, a prior Board determination that the appellant's statement that he would report a disclosure to the IG was protected did not serve to collaterally estop consideration of whether the disclosures themselves were protected: "Because issue preclusion is only applicable when 'the issue previously adjudicated is identical with that now presented.' <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA,</span> 794 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1986)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Booth v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 266, 269 (1987) (collateral estoppel is effective to preclude relitigation of an issue actually litigated and decided in an earlier proceeding, but only if the "precise issue the appellant is estopped from litigating was necessarily decided in the earlier proceeding"; a conviction for drug possession did not estop the appellant from challenging the charge of sale or distribution of a drug).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tanner v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 417, 421-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12 (2003), applied collateral estoppel to distinguish two appeals of a resignation--one based upon intolerable working conditions, the other based upon misinformation--and the Board concluded that the later appeal was not precluded by the prior appeal on grounds of either <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, because the earlier appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, or collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held, however, that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is a basis to dismiss an appeal over which the Board has jurisdiction, not a basis to dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">E.g., Besemer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 260, 263 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also Spears v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 766 F.2d 520, 522-23 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and determination of the Board's jurisdiction treated as separate determinations). The Board has also held that "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>...does not apply to bar a prior claim that has been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 370, &#x00B6; 12 (2002), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 55 Fed. Appx. 563 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see Armas v. Department of Justice</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 244, 248 (1996) ("<span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is not applicable to a prior decision that dismissed an appeal for lack of jurisdiction"). We find that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not apply here because the appellant's 1995 Board appeal had been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may, however, apply collateral estoppel to rulings on jurisdictional issues. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 481, 484 (1997); <span class="Italic">Sessions v. Department of the Army</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 343, 347-48 (1997); <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 338. In fact, the court and the Board have applied collateral estoppel to prior decisions finding that a retirement was not involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Mintzmyer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423-24 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 604, 609 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when: (1) An issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In determining whether an issue is identical for collateral estoppel purposes, differences precluding the application of collateral estoppel may be in facts, subject matter, periods of time, case law, statutes, procedural protections, notions of public interest, or qualifications of tribunals. <span class="Italic">Siegert v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 684, 688 (1988). Thus, before a party can invoke collateral estoppel, the legal matter raised in the subsequent proceeding must involve the same set of events or documents and the same "bundle of legal principles" that contributed to the rendering of the first judgment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 688-89.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the issue in this appeal is not identical to the issue involved in the appellant's prior Board appeal. Although the appellant asserted in both appeals that his resignation was involuntary, he claimed in his 1995 appeal that his resignation was involuntary because he was under the influence of medication he was taking for anxiety and stress at the time, the agency made his working conditions intolerable, the agency did not follow proper procedures in accepting his resignation, and the agency did not accommodate his hearing disability. He now asserts that his resignation was involuntary based on misinformation relating to his reinstatement rights that the agency provided to him when he resigned. The legal tests the appellant must meet, and the underlying facts he must prove, differ in the two appeals. <span class="Italic">Compare Markon v. Department of State,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 577-78 (1996) (where intolerable working conditions are alleged, the Board will find an action involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that the agency engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire), <span class="Italic">with Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (a retirement action is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment). Moreover, the issue involved in this appeal was not identified as an issue to be contested by the parties in 1995, nor was it resolved by the AJ at that time; <span class="Italic">see Fisher v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 509, 514 (1994) (the "actually litigated" criterion for the application of collateral estoppel requires that the issue have been contested by the parties and resolved by the adjudicator). Thus, because the issue in this appeal is not identical to the issue involved in the prior action, and was not actually litigated in 1995, collateral estoppel does not apply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Issues concerning finality of a decision and identity of issues in sequential cases were not precluded by collateral estoppel in <span class="Italic">Castillejos v. OPM</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Collateral estoppel "means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit." <span class="Italic">Ashe v. Swenson</span>, 397 U.S. 436, 443 (1970). Agency decisions may ground collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc</span>., 575 U.S. 138, 141-42 (2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether an agency decision satisfies the finality requirement, "reference must be made to the procedures of the agency that specify what official has authority to decide and the point at which the decision becomes effective." Restatement (Second) of Judgments, &#x00A7; 83 cmt. e (Am. Law Inst. 1982).[1] An initial decision by an AJ subject to review by the Board is not a final judgment and cannot be the basis for collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">Zgonc v. Dep't of Def</span>., 103 M.S.P.R. 666, 669 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Wade v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 396, 398 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 104 F.3d 375 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table)). Here, as the government agrees, the Board erred in dismissing the suit based on collateral estoppel because <span class="Italic">Castillejos III</span>, which is still pending review by the full Board, is not a final judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_1536"></span>[1]&#x2003;We have held in the context of administrative proceedings for challenging the validity of patents that collateral estoppel applies after this court affirms the agency's decision or once it is not subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">See XY, LLC v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we generally review the Board's decisions on the grounds "upon which the record discloses that its action was based," <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp</span>., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943), we may, "where appropriate, affirm the Board on grounds other than those relied upon in rendering its decision, when upholding the Board's decision does not depend upon making a determination of fact not previously made by the Board," <span class="Italic">Killip v. OPM</span>, 991 F.2d 1564, 1568-69 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Chenery</span>, 318 U.S. at 88). The government urges this court to affirm the dismissal of the case on grounds of adjudicatory efficiency because "[t]he Board has often ruled that it is appropriate to dismiss a second appeal on the grounds of adjudicatory efficiency when it raises claims already decided in an initial decision in an earlier appeal." <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dep't of Lab</span>., 561 F. App'x 978, 982 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with the government's argument and the Board's apparent conclusion that Mr. Castillejos is filing "serial applications seeking the same annuity based on the same period of Federal civilian service," is that Mr. Castillejos raises different claims in this case. <span class="Italic">Castillejos III</span> involved only the period of employment between 1974 and 1986. Here, Mr. Castillejos additionally argues for benefits based on his employment between 1987 and 1992. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, these are facially different claims. Under these circumstances, we decline to affirm the Board's dismissal on grounds of adjudicatory efficiency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under<span class="Italic"> Simmons v. SBA</span>, 475 F.3d 1372, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 2007), collateral estoppel (defined by the court to constitute issue preclusion) applies to issues that could have been raised in earlier proceedings--in <span class="Italic">Simmons,</span> a challenge in a district court to a settlement agreement reached in a Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Simmons challenges her 1998 separation as a constructive discharge and claims that this removal breached the 1996 settlement. However, both of these claims were within the scope of the 1998 settlement's release clause and are only viable if the 1998 settlement was invalid. We conclude that the Board did not err in barring Simmons from re-litigating the validity of the 1998 settlement, though we believe that collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) rather than <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> (claim preclusion) is the appropriate basis. Under our case law, the doctrine of issue preclusion bars litigation of an issue if an identical issue was actually litigated and necessarily decided in a prior case where the interests of the party to be precluded were fully represented. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Gen. Serv. Admin.,</span> 794 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Simmons's mere assertion of a different ground for invalidity of the settlement in this action (misrepresentation) than that litigated in the district court (incapacity and duress/undue influence) does not bar application of issue preclusion because "[I]t is reasonable to require [a party] to bring forward all evidence in support of [its argument] in the initial proceeding." Restatement of the Law (Second) Judgments &#x00A7; 27, comment c, illustration 4 (a verdict rejecting A's claim that B was negligent for speeding barred A from asserting B's negligence on any theory, not just speeding); <span class="Italic">see also Mintzmyer v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (a district court's finding that alleged age and gender discrimination did not result in a constructive discharge barred litigating whether an alleged reprisal for whistleblowing constituted constructive discharge). Nor does Simmons's allegation of agency misrepresentation prevent application of collateral estoppel. The evidence Simmons cites for the Agency's alleged misrepresentation of her removal date--an Agency pre-hearing submission from February 19, 1998--was clearly available to her long before she filed her district court action. Similarly, Simmons has never alleged that she was not aware, or could not have become aware through reasonable efforts, of the Agency's other alleged misrepresentation--the identity of her first line supervisor--before she filed her district court action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#x00A7; 28(5) (providing an exception to issue preclusion when a party "as a result of the conduct of his adversary...did not have an <span class="Italic">adequate</span> opportunity...to obtain a full and fair adjudication" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a Board decision is appealed to the Federal Circuit, collateral estoppel operates to preclude the issues specifically determined by the circuit, <span class="Italic">Marassa v. USPS</span>, 287 Fed. Appx. 878, 882-83 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the Board erred in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel to dismiss Mr. Marassa's second appeal. Although in the first appeal AJ Puglia did indeed make findings regarding Mr. Marassa's lack of full recovery and removal for cause in June of 1989, and did indeed conclude from these findings that the Board lacked jurisdiction, we did not rely on these findings in <span class="Italic">Marassa I</span> and instead affirmed the Board's decision on an alternative ground. <span class="Italic">See Marassa I,</span> 249 Fed. Appx. at 178 n.1 ("[A]lthough <span class="Italic">not relevant to our decision</span>, Marassa was removed from this position for being absent without official leave") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 180 (affirming because "Marassa has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was fully recovered by October 10, 1988--one year after he was eligible for compensation"). Thus, though the issues of Mr. Marassa's full recovery and removal were actually litigated in the first appeal, they were not essential to the judgment and cannot serve to collaterally estop Mr. Marassa from contesting jurisdiction in the second appeal. <span class="Italic">See Morgan,</span> 424 F.3d at 1274-1275; <span class="Italic">cf. Mandich v. Watters,</span> 970 F.2d 462, 465 (8th Cir. 1992) ("The general rule is that, if a judgment is appealed, collateral estoppel only works as to those issues specifically passed upon by the appellate court.")
