<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-71"><span class="space">7.</span> District Court Review</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7702(e) and 5 USC 7703(b)(2) should be reviewed for the proper dates and stages of judicial review for mixed cases. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 USC 2000e-16(c)), the ADEA, and the Rehabilitation Act must be reviewed to determine the filing periods set by these statutes. Description of cases interpreting the statutory time limits for filing civil rights cases in court are beyond the scope of this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. Several sections of the Board's regulations, 5 CFR 1201.157, 1201.161, .162, and 5 CFR 1201.175 (2022), bear on and summarize the time limits for judicial review in district court if adjudication of EEO issues is desired:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.157&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Notice of right to judicial review</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any final decision of the Board under 5 U.S.C. 7702 will notify the appellant of his or her right, within 30 days after receiving the Board's final decision, to petition the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to consider the Board's decision, or to file a civil action in an appropriate United States district court. If an appellant elects to waive the discrimination issue, an appeal may be filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as stated in &#x00A7; 1201.120 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.161(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judicial review</span>. The Board's decision will become judicially reviewable on:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;The date on which the decision is issued, if the appellant does not file a petition with the Commission under 5 U.S.C. 7702(b)(1); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;The date of the Commission's decision that it will not consider the petition filed under 5 U.S.C. 7702(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.162(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judicial review</span>. If the Board concurs in or adopts the decision of the Commission under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the decision of the Board is a judicially reviewable action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.175&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judicial review of cases decided under 5 U.S.C. 7702</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Place and type of review</span>. The appropriate United States district court is authorized to conduct all judicial review of cases decided under 5 U.S.C. 7702. Those cases include appeals from actions taken under the following provisions: Section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(c)); section 15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended (29 U.S.C. 633a(c)); and section 15(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. 216(b)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time for filing request</span>. Regardless of any other provision of law, requests for judicial review of all cases decided under 5 U.S.C. 7702 must be filed within 30 days after the appellant received notice of the judicially reviewable action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In any appeal within its jurisdiction involving an allegation of prohibited discrimination, under <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Dept. of Army</span>, 119 MSPR 147, 152-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14, 2013 MSPB 7 (2013), the Board will provide a mixed-case judicial review notice, although in <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span> that notice was not provided because the Board concluded it lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal from a probationary termination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an individual alleges that a personnel action, which can be appealed to the Board, was taken against him because of discrimination, the dispute is referred to as a "mixed case appeal." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2). The statute governing mixed cases provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1)&#x2003; Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(v)&#x2003;any rule, regulation, or policy directive prescribed under any provision of law described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this subparagraph,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701 of this title and this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). The appellant in a mixed case may seek review of the Board's final decision before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; he may also institute an action in federal district court, where the Board's findings and conclusions on issues other than discrimination are subject to review and the discrimination claim proceeds <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(b)(1) &#x0026; (d)(1), 7703(b)(2). By contrast, the appellant in a non-mixed case may seek review of the Board's final decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the past, the Board has provided notice of mixed-case appeal rights in its final decision only when the Board actually decided a claim of discrimination. In all other cases--including one in which a claim of discrimination was raised but not decided--the Board has provided notice of non-mixed appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Haffarnan v. Department of the Army</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 348, &#x00B6; 3 (2000) (the administrative judge "erred in failing to provide the appellant with notice of 'mixed case' appeal rights after she adjudicated the appellant's claim of disability discrimination"); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Army</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 678, 682-83 (1987) (providing non-mixed appeal rights in an appeal from a removal because, under the unusual circumstances of the case, the administrative judge "properly dismissed the appellant's claim of discrimination" without deciding it).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, |133 S. Ct. 596, 184 L. Ed. 2d 433 (2012), requires us to reexamine the circumstances under which we provide notice of mixed-case appeal rights in our final decisions. In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, the appellant appealed her removal to the Board and claimed that the action was motivated by sex and age discrimination. She sought and received a dismissal of her appeal without prejudice, but she refiled her appeal beyond the deadline for doing so. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely refiled and did not decide the appellant's discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Department of Labor</span>, MSPB Docket No. CH-0752-08-0150-I-1, Initial Decision (Feb. 27, 2008). Neither party filed a petition for review with the full Board, so the administrative judge's decision became final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant then filed an action in district court. The court dismissed the matter, reasoning that review lay in the Federal Circuit and not in district court because the final Board decision did not resolve "the merits of [the appellant's] discrimination claim[s]." <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, No. 4:09CV804-DJS, 2010 U.S. Dist. Lexis 14425 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 18, 2010). The Eighth Circuit affirmed based on the same rationale. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 639 F.3d 834, 838 (8th Cir. 2011) (the appellant's right of review was in the Federal Circuit because "the MSPB did not reach the merits of Kloeckner's discrimination claims").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the district court had jurisdiction. The Court began its analysis with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), which provides that "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7702 shall be filed" in district court. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, 133 S. Ct. at 603. The Court then explained that cases of discrimination "subject to" section 7702 are those in which the appellant "has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board" and "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination" prohibited by one of the listed statutes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 603-04 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(A) &#x0026; (B)). The Court concluded that such cases must be filed in district court, not the Federal Circuit, even when the Board does not decide the discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 604.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In light of <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, we shall now provide notice of mixed-case appeal rights in all cases in which the appellant was affected by an action that he or she may appeal to the Board and alleges prohibited discrimination, regardless of whether we decide the claim of discrimination. In providing such notice of the option to file a civil action in district court, we would make no representation whether the district court will determine that the appellant has met the administrative exhaustion requirements for filing a civil action before that court. In the present case, we provide notice of non-mixed appeal rights. Although the appellant alleges that the agency's decision to terminate her appointment during her probationary period was based on disability discrimination, as fully explained above she does not have the right to appeal her probationary termination to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ikossi v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 516 F.3d 1037 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (mixed case judicial review process encompasses claims under the Rehabilitation Act).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Cunningham,</span> the Board stated that mixed-case appeal rights would be provided as to counsel fee decisions when the underlying case involves alleged discrimination, <span class="Italic">Caros v.

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_5272"></span>A mixed-case appeal is an appeal filed directly to the Board that alleges that an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, genetic information, or reprisal. <span class="Italic">Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 7 (2013); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.151.

Alternatively, an appellant can seek administrative review of a mixed case before the EEOC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b), (e)(3). For nonmixed-case appeals governed by the procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, a party may seek judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.157.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Historically, the Board provided notice of mixed-case appeal rights in its final decision only when the Board actually decided a claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 147, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). In all other cases, including one in which a claim of discrimination was raised but not decided, the Board provided notice of nonmixed appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board reversed course, however, after the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14. In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, the Court noted that cases of discrimination "subject to" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 are those in which the appellant "has been affected by an action which [he] may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board" and "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by" one of the listed statutes. 133 S.

<p class="Block-Quote2">After <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, the Board determined that it would provide notice of mixed-case appeal rights in all cases in which the appellant was affected by an action appealable to the Board and alleged prohibited discrimination, regardless of whether the Board decided the claim of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 147, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Stringer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. CH-0752-14-0207-I-1, Final Order at 2 (July 21, 2014) (providing notice of mixed-case appeal rights where the appellant's appeal was dismissed as untimely); <span class="Italic">Barazzone v.

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-0432-09-0384-I-1, Final Order at 2 (Feb. 25, 2013) (same). The Board continues to provide notice of nonmixed-case appeal rights in all cases dismissed by the Board on jurisdictional grounds, including cases in which the appellant raised a discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Conforto v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 713 F.3d 1111, 1117-19 (Fed. Cir. 2013).[10] <span class="Italic">see Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 12 (2013) (finding that when jurisdiction is in doubt and an appeal has been dismissed on procedural grounds, nonmixed-case appeal rights apply); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 12 (2013) (nonmixed-case appeal rights apply where an appellant withdraws her discrimination claim before the administrative judge issues a decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[10]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Conforto</span>, the Federal Circuit explained that <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> did not affect its prior case law regarding the Board's jurisdictional dismissals and that it has jurisdiction over a petition when the Board dismisses for lack of jurisdiction. 713 F.3d at 1117-18. Here, the appellant's petition for attorney fees was not dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In light of <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> and its progeny, we now consider whether addendum proceedings for attorney fees stemming from a mixed case require notice of mixed-case appeal rights. We conclude that they do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Here, the appellant's underlying appeal included an allegation that the agency retaliated against him based on his prior EEO activity. Accordingly, the Board provided the appellant with notice of mixed-case appeal rights with the decision on that underlying appeal. The addendum initial decision currently before the Board on review concerns the appellant's petition for attorney fees, not the merits of his original claim against the agency. The fact remains, however, that the appellant's petition for attorney fees stems from a mixed case. As the Federal Circuit observed when presented with similar circumstances in <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 2012-3142, 2014 WL 6462265, at *1 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 17, 2013), the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> decision is not ambiguous: a federal employee should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit, when he claims that an agency action violates an anti-discrimination statute, and he should follow the same course in ancillary proceedings that stem from such a claim. We agree.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On direct appellate review of an MSPB decision, the Federal Circuit has jurisdiction only over those appeals seeking review of final agency actions if no claim of discrimination has been preserved for judicial review; if discrimination is a matter on appeal, the entire action is within the purview of a district court. <span class="Italic">Rosano v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1315, 1316 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Christo v. MSPB</span>, 667 F.2d 882, 885 (10th Cir. 1981) (reviewing legislative history of the Reform Act: "We hold that where review is sought under the Civil Service Reform Act for those matters in which jurisdiction lies in the district court under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), the entire action comes within the jurisdiction of that court. This court has jurisdiction, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1), only over those cases seeking review of final agency actions in which no claim of discrimination has been preserved for judicial review"). Only those claims raised with the MSPB in a mixed case will be reviewed in district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hashimoto v. Dalton</span>, 118 F.3d 671, 679 (9th Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Johnson</span>, 968 F. Supp. 439 (E.D. Ark. 1997); <span class="Italic">Vanover v. O'Leary</span>, 967 F.

Minn. 1994) ("Because McAdams failed to raise her other discrimination claims in the context of her MSPB appeals, this Court has no jurisdiction to consider them now"). If an appellant does not properly raise issues of discrimination with the Board, but seeks review in district court of civil service issues from the resulting Board decision, his remedy appears to be a motion to transfer the case to the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Hays v. Postmaster Gen.</span>, 868 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1989). But if a district court decides that a discrimination action has not been properly made out, and then rules on civil service issues, review is properly in the regional circuit court of appeals, not in the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Botta v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 85-2218) (citing <span class="Italic">Blake v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 794 F.2d 170 (5th Cir. 1986), and <span class="Italic">Paetz v. United States</span>, 795 F.2d 1533 (11th Cir. 1986)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If EEOC remands a case to MSPB after finding one type of discrimination but not finding discrimination on another basis, all bases for discrimination are reviewable when MSPB issues its final decision unless there is severance of the EEO claims by EEOC. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Randel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 157 F.3d 392, 395-96 (5th Cir. 1998). If a Board decision is taken to EEOC, judicial review is then in the district court, not in the Federal Circuit as the circuit stated in an order in <span class="Italic">Metz v. McHugh</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP No. 2013-3107):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Metz appeals the decision of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") concurring with the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board finding no discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court lacks jurisdiction to hear Metz's appeal. "If an employee loses her mixed case appeal on the merits of her discrimination claim, she may obtain further review of the adverse decision, either from a district court or from the EEOC and then (if necessary) a district court, but not from this court." <span class="Italic">Conforto v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 703 F.3d 1111, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(a)(3), 7703(b)(2); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.303-310). Indeed, the EEOC's decision expressly states that Metz has "the right to file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court based on the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board, within thirty (30) calendar days of the date that [she] receive[d] th[e] decision."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to mixed cases first taken to an arbitrator, there is authority that MSPB review will be obtained before the case is brought into district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052 v.

<p class="Body-Text">The commentary that follows is offered with a cautionary note: it but skims the surface of the hundreds of decisions in federal courts concerning federal employees' EEO claims and mixed-case review of MSPB decisions. The jurisdictional issues involved in judicial review of mixed-case Board decisions, whether substantive or jurisdictional, is complex.
