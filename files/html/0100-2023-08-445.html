<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-439"><span class="space">a.</span> Rule of Three</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 332.405 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Three considerations for appointment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appointing officer is not required to consider an eligible who has been considered by him for three separate appointments from the same or different certificates for the same position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "rule of three" was considered in an ALJ appointment case that led to a remand for further development, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, DA-300A-12-0651-I-1 (NP 11/4/2013) (aff'd following remand, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, DA-300A-12-0651-B-1 (NP 6/17/2016), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, 708 Fed. Appx. 669 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), <span class="Italic">post):</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In July 2008, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued Vacancy Announcement 2008ALJ-134575 advertising Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) positions. The appellant applied for an ALJ position under this vacancy announcement. After completing the ALJ examination, the appellant was given a numerical rating and began to appear on certificates of eligible candidates for various vacancies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In January 2012, the Social Security Administration (SSA) requested that OPM provide it with a certificate of eligible candidates for approximately 120 ALJ positions with the SSA. The SSA also provided OPM with a list of ALJ applicants, including the appellant, who had already received at least three considerations, and requested that OPM exclude those applicants from certification by applying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405, otherwise known as the "rule of three." In response to the SSA's request, OPM stated that it would not include applicants who had received three or more considerations from the SSA on the certificate of eligible candidates requested by the SSA. The appellant was thereby excluded from the certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_857"></span>The appellant subsequently filed three Board appeals about the matter and requested hearings. In one of those appeals, the appellant challenged the SSA's request that OPM eliminate him from the certificate, and the SSA was named as the respondent agency. In the other two appeals, the appellant challenged OPM's decision to comply with that request, and OPM was named as the respondent agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction without hearings. She found that the appellant was attempting to challenge the merits of his nonselection rather than any employment practice <span class="Italic">per se</span>, and, in any event, the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the rule of three or its application to him violated any of the basic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. The appellant has petitioned for review, and the agencies have responded in opposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established Board jurisdiction over his employment practices appeals.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal when two conditions are met: first, the appeal must concern an "employment practice," and, second, the employment practice must be alleged to have violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 100.104(a). The Board has found that the second jurisdictional element is established by making a nonfrivolous allegation. <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 7 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employment practice at issue in this appeal is the rule of three, set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. <span class="Italic">See Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 773 F.2d 313, 315 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the rule of three is an employment practice for purposes of Board jurisdiction). However, the appellant is not challenging the validity of the rule of three <span class="Italic">per se</span>, and in fact he appears to admit that it is valid. Rather, he is arguing that this employment practice was inapplicable to him. <span class="Italic">See Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720, 724 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (the applicability of a valid OPM requirement can be considered by the Board to the same extent as any other employment practice); <span class="Italic">accord Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 10 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agencies argue that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's claim because OPM was not involved in administering this practice. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887-88 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (for purposes of Board jurisdiction, OPM must be significantly involved in the employment practice at issue); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). We disagree. The Federal Circuit has rejected this same argument as "wholly fanciful and unrealistic." <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, 773 F.2d at 315 n.3. OPM's promulgation of the rule of three alone is sufficient to establish its substantial involvement in that practice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OPM's involvement is established even more firmly in this case based on the undisputed fact that OPM itself revised the certificates of eligibles to exclude the appellant based on that rule. We therefore find that the instant appeal concerns an employment practice that OPM was involved in administering.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the improper application of this employment practice violated one of the basic principles of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, i.e., discrimination based on a "nonmerit" factor--his previous consideration on three certificates of eligibles. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(c). We therefore find that the issue in the instant appeal is the same as that in <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>--whether the rule of three was improperly applied to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 773 F.2d at 315-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, unlike <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, the appellant in this case has made factual allegations that, if proven, could establish that the rule of three should not have applied to him. Specifically, the text of OPM's regulation reads as follows: "An appointing officer is not required to consider an eligible who has been considered by him for three separate appointments from the same or different certificates for the same position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. The appellant alleges that, although he appeared on three different certificates of eligibles and was considered by the SSA three times, he was not considered by the same "appointing officer" each time as required by the plain language of the regulation. He alleges that the individual whom the SSA identified as the "appointing officer" in all three of his nonselections in fact performed only ministerial duties on behalf of the actual "appointing officers," of which there were more than one. The appellant thus alleges that he was not considered three times by the same "appointing officer," and he argues that the rule of three, by its own terms, was inapplicable to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that there may be some merit to the appellant's allegations. Specifically, the SSA appears to have admitted that its "appointing officer" is responsible only for verifying the legality and procedural propriety of the appointments, whereas the "selecting officials" are responsible for making substantive judgments and actually choosing which eligibles to appoint. The appellant questions this distinction, and so do we. Specifically, OPM has published guidance stating that "appointing official" and "selecting official" mean the same thing. <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM, Delegated Examining Operations Handbook: A Guide for Federal Agency Examining Offices (May 2007), Glossary, <span class="Italic">available a</span>t <a href="https://www.opm.gov/deu/handbook_2007/deo_ handbook.pdf">www.opm.gov/deu/handbook_2007/deo_ handbook.pdf</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>] . The basis for the SSA to make this distinction is therefore unclear, and it is similarly unclear whether it appoints ALJ candidates pursuant to the delegated authority of its "selecting officials" or its "appointing official." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (a selecting or appointing official is "[a] person having the authority, by law, or by duly delegated authority, to appoint, employ, or promote individuals within an agency").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons explained above, we find that the appellant has established jurisdiction over his employment practices appeals. In particular, we find that he has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the SSA, in cooperation with OPM, applied the rule of three to him even though he was not considered three times by the same appointing officer as required for the rule to apply under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. We therefore remand these appeals for further adjudication of that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We disagree with the appellant's other theories of the case.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be clear, we are remanding this appeal only for further adjudication of the issue discussed above. The appellant has raised a number of other matters in this appeal that do not warrant further adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the appellant argues that the rule of three does not apply to his situation because his nonselections were related to multiple certificates of eligibles. We find this argument unpersuasive because the plain language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405 states that the rule of three applies regardless of whether the three considerations were "from the same or different certificates."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the term "position" as used in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405 should be construed to refer to a single vacancy rather than all jobs with the same title. In other words, although he was considered a total of three times for multiple ALJ positions, he was never considered three times for a single ALJ position as contemplated by the regulation. We disagree. The appellant is essentially urging the Board to read the word "position" synonymously with "vacancy," but OPM's regulations define the terms differently. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101 (defining "vacancy"), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(e) (defining "position"). We will not ignore this difference in interpreting the related regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. Rather, we interpret the term "position" generically, consistent with its use in 5 U.S.C. chapter 51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the SSA's application of the rule of three violated other OPM regulations. However, the Board's employment practices jurisdiction only extends to challenges based on the three grounds set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 and does not give the Board jurisdiction over any and all legal challenges to employment practices. <span class="Italic">Meeker</span>, 319 F.3d at 1374; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). Accordingly, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's legal challenges to the rule of three that are not based on the grounds set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Application of the "rule of three" to the SSA ALJ hiring process was reaffirmed after remand, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, DA-300A-12-0651-B-1 (NP 6/17/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the remand order, the Board questioned the apparent distinction made by SSA between selecting officials (those responsible for making substantive judgments and actually choosing which eligible to appoint) and appointing officials (those responsible for verifying the legality and procedural propriety of the appointments). The Board also noted that OPM published guidance stating that a selecting official and an appointing official mean the same thing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Delegated Examining Operations Handbook: A Guide for Federal Agency Examining Offices</span> (<span class="Italic">Handbook</span>), May 2007, <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>). Based on our review of the hearing testimony and evidence, we agree with the administrative judge that it was reasonable for SSA to have different selecting and appointing officials in the ALJ selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that the regulation itself does not appear to contain any prohibition regarding different selecting and appointing officials. The <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> defines an appointing officer and a selecting official as a "person having the authority, by law, or by duly delegated authority, to appoint, employ, or promote individuals to positions in an agency." We are not persuaded that OPM's use of the same definition for appointing officer and selecting official precluded different persons from filling these roles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, OPM's Lead Human Resources Specialist at the ALJ Program Office, Nancy Ford, who had 15 years of experience with OPM at the time of the hearing, testified that the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> was intended only as a "handy reference" and that the selecting and appointing officials are often different people because they perform different functions in the ALJ selection process. For instance, Ms. Ford testified that the selecting official interviews applicants and is more "hands on," whereas the appointing official supervises, oversees, and approves the selection. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge credited Ms. Ford's testimony in this regard. The Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility <span id="Page_858"></span>determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Where, as here, an administrative judge has heard live testimony via videoconference, her credibility determinations must be deemed to be at least implicitly based upon the demeanor of the witnesses, <span class="Italic">Little v. Department of Transportation</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 4 (2009). The appellant has not provided a sufficiently sound reason on review to overturn the administrative judge's credibility determination as to Ms. Ford.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The administrative judge also properly noted that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Board have issued decisions acknowledging situations in which there were different selecting and appointing officials. RID at 9 (citing <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 246 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1981), and <span class="Italic">Brock v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 564, 567 (1991)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant does not dispute that SSA fills ALJ positions across the country and in Puerto Rico, that it occasionally hires as many as 100 ALJs in a single day, and that it could hire as many as 10,000 ALJs per year. Ms. Ford credibly testified that it would be difficult for one selecting official to manage multiple vacancies across the country. Given the volume and the geographical scope of the SSA ALJ hiring process, we discern no error with SSA's decision to designate different selecting and appointing officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also challenges the administrative judge's conclusion that Nancy Peters, SSA's Director of the Center for Personnel Policy and Staffing, was the appointing official who considered him three times pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. For instance, he asserts that Ms. Peters only performed ministerial functions and that she did not consider his merit and fitness in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.404. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.404 (stating that an appointing officer shall select an eligible "with sole regard to merit and fitness"). These arguments are unavailing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not cited, and we are not aware of, any statutory or regulatory authority, or case law from the Board or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) that supports his contention that an appointing official cannot perform ministerial and administrative tasks. Moreover, the documentary evidence and testimony from several OPM and SSA witnesses demonstrate that Ms. Peters was the appointing official during the relevant time frame. Notwithstanding this evidence, the appellant maintains that the SSA selecting officials, such as Chief ALJ Frank Cristaudo, were the true appointing officials because they considered his merit and fitness. The administrative judge did not find this argument persuasive, and neither do we.[6] Notably, Ms. Peters testified that she "sat in" on deliberations between the selecting officials when they were discussing the merit and fitness of the candidates, including the appellant. Ms. Peters also testified that she reviewed a matrix of information drafted by Mr. Robert Gehlken to ensure that veterans' preference and the rule of three were properly applied to each candidate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Even if we assumed for the purposes of our analysis that Chief ALJ Cristaudo was the appointing official in 2009, the parties stipulated that he considered the appellant's application three times. Thus, even under this alternative theory, the appellant received all the consideration to which he was entitled pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant further argues that when ALJ Jasper Bede replaced Chief ALJ Cristaudo as the selecting official, he was entitled to three new considerations by him, and that, when ALJ Kathleen Scully-Hayes replaced ALJ Bede as the selecting official, he was entitled to three new considerations by her. The appellant offers no legal authority to support this interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. Moreover, we agree with SSA that this interpretation would render the number of considerations for any particular candidate dependent on SSA's staffing changes, which could lead to some candidates receiving many more considerations than others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge credited Ms. Peters's testimony that she personally sat in on the deliberations for the 138th, 139th, and 140th selections involving the appellant, and she concluded that Ms. Peters's participation in the selection process through her review of the selection matrix and presence during the deliberations constituted proper consideration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. We have considered the appellant's arguments on review challenging these findings. However, he has not identified any sufficiently sound reasons for overturning the administrative judge's credibility determination in this regard, <span class="Italic">see Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1301, nor has he persuaded us that her conclusions were otherwise erroneous, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., HCD (Ms. Ford testified that she did a "line by line" audit to make sure each candidate was given proper consideration and she concluded that the appellant was given three considerations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's other arguments on review, but we find that they present no reason to disturb the administrative judge's well-reasoned findings. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings where she considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions); <span class="Italic">see also Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (same). Under these circumstances, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was given three considerations by the appointing official as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Barkalow v. Social Security Administration</span>, No. 2006-3237, 2006 WL 2853098, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 5, 2006) (affirming the Board's finding that the petitioner was given the requisite three considerations because he was considered for positions in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Shreveport, Louisiana, and San Antonio, Texas); <span class="Italic">see also Lackhouse</span>, 773 F.2d at 317 (concluding that the rule of three was properly applied to Mr. Lackhouse). We therefore find that SSA properly requested that OPM remove the appellant from any future certificates and OPM properly granted this request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we affirm the administrative judge's decision to deny corrective action in these employment practices appeals, we also deny the appellant's request to remand the appeal to order SSA to disclose the names of similarly situated ALJ candidates and to allow him an opportunity to establish a class.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, in turn, affirmed, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, 708 Fed. Appx. 669, 671 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appointing officer may delegate her appointment duties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vandewall v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 5 F.3d 1504, 1993 WL 302646 at *2 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("[S]election letters written by officials lacking appointment authority [a]re valid so long as the appointing official had exercised her discretion by approving the issuance of each selecting letter."); <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 693 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (holding that a "selection letter from, or with the knowledge of, an official having appointive authority" constitutes appointment). Here, O'Leary concedes that he was properly "considered for appointment as an [administrative law judge] three times by then SSA Chief Judge Frank Cristaudo." And there is no dispute that Cristaudo made his administrative law judge selection recommendations under the authority of Peters. (Cristaudo testifying that he knew Peters was the appointing officer). Therefore, the appointing officer here simply delegated her proper consideration of O'Leary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">O'Leary argues that the appointing officer must personally consider the "merit and fitness" of an eligible in order to invoke &#x00A7; 332.405.[1] We agree with the Board that "given the number of appointments under her auspices, it is reasonable [for Peters] to delegate duties to others with first-hand knowledge of the requirements of the [administrative law judge] position." Having effectively delegated her appointment duties, Peters was not required to personally consider the merits of O'Leary's candidacy and could appropriately defer to the merits recommendations from Chief Judge Cristaudo.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Peters testified that her personal consideration during the appointment process did not pertain to the "merits" of O'Leary's candidacy.</p>
