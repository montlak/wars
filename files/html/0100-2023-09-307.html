<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board is not reluctant to impose sanctions against an agency if it fails to produce testimony or other evidence necessary for fair adjudication, privilege claims must be resolved first. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rooney v. USDA</span>, 26 MSPR 142, 146-47 (1985). If a subpoena is served on an agency for documents and witnesses (the subpoena having already been approved on the motion of the party seeking it), and the agency believes that the subpoena is unenforceable, the proper course is to file a motion to quash the subpoena or vacate the discovery order, not to ignore it. If an agency decides unilaterally to ignore Board discovery orders, the AJ may properly invoke sanctions against the agency, including the sanction of striking its evidence. <span class="Italic">Eaks v. DOJ</span>, 18 MSPR 328, 333 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 10 MSPR 13, 16 (1982) (agency failed to produce materials to the appellant at the direction of the AJ; for its blatant defiance, the agency was slapped with an order striking all of its pleadings and submissions, with the result that the adverse action was set aside because the agency failed to meet its burden of proof). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Starks v. Dept. of Army</span>, 94 MSPR 95, 98 &#x00B6; 7 (2003) (sanctions were inappropriate when the agency's delay in providing documents was inadvertent and the agency provided them promptly on learning of their existence); <span class="Italic">Jacoby v. USPS</span>, 85 <span id="Page_1291"></span>MSPR 554, 559 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (AJ properly denied sanctions when the delays of the agency were short and the appellant did not explain how his substantive rights were harmed by the slight delays); <span class="Italic">Tropiak v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 274, 279 (1993) (sanctions were not appropriate when the agency provided a copy of the requested material a day after the sanctions motion was filed; sanctions served no purpose since neither party was prejudiced); <span class="Italic">Braxton v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 423, 424-25 (1981) (denying sanctions when the agency apparently failed to produce some requested documentation concerning disparate penalties that was supplied by the appellant with his PFR: "[i]n view of the great amount of material produced by the agency on very short notice, and the lack of any showing of negligence or bad faith on the part of the agency, we find that the agency made a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> effort to comply with the orders of the administrative law judge and the presiding official.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a sanction to be imposed for failure to produce a witness, the witness must be within the agency's control. No cause existed to impose sanctions against an agency that failed to produce a deposition witness who was no longer a federal employee. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 769 F.2d 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1985). But cause existed to impose sanctions against an agency that failed to exercise due diligence in determining whether an employee presented a valid medical excuse for not attending a deposition, <span class="Italic">Gores v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 100, 110-11 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge should not have drawn an adverse inference regarding evidence that had Goblet as its source for the agency's alleged failure to produce Goblet for a deposition requested by the appellant. In this connection, the agency argues, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that it exercised due diligence in attempting to produce Goblet for the deposition, but that he was unable to appear due to his medical condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge may impose sanctions against a party for failure to follow the Board's regulations or failure to respond to the administrative judge's orders. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">Carrier v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 54, 56 (1994). Sanctions should be imposed when a party has failed to exercise due diligence in complying with any order, or when a party has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to so comply. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 56-57. An administrative judge should not resort to the use of sanctions, however, unless necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 57.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the imposition of sanctions was in the interest of justice because the agency did not exercise due diligence in attempting to have Goblet appear for the requested deposition. The record shows that the agency ordered Goblet to attend the deposition, but that he stated to his supervisor, John Dunn, that he was unable to appear due to his medical condition. He also provided a medical certificate from his treating physician, Dr. Harris Brenner, that stated that it was inadvisable that he attend a deposition. Although the agency submitted evidence establishing that Goblet has suffered from anxiety, dysthymia, and severe depression since 1990, and that he has been incapacitated due to his condition for all of 1994, we note that his condition did not impair his ability to testify at his equal employment opportunity hearing on October 28, 1992. Moreover, since Dr. Brenner fails to diagnose the ailment that has incapacitated Goblet, the agency's unquestioning acceptance of Goblet's medical evidence shows that the agency did not exercise due diligence. Therefore, by passively accepting Dr. Brenner's note, the agency has not met its obligation of good faith and due diligence to produce Goblet at the deposition requested by the appellant. Consequently, we find that the imposition of sanctions in this case was in the interest of justice.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 435, 437 &#x00B6; 5 (1998), imposed a sanction, severely truncating the agency's case, when the agency failed to comply with orders directing document production:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The sanctions are the drawing of the inference that the requested documents would demonstrate that 14 agency witnesses testified during the OIG investigation in a manner inconsistent with their later testimony during an "AR 15-6" investigation, the results of which were relied on by the agency in issuing the notice of removal to the appellant. As a result of the inferred inconsistencies, the AJ further found that such witnesses were not credible for purposes of this appeal and therefore would not be approved to testify in the hearing in this appeal.</p>

We find that the sanction imposed in this case was not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant initiated discovery proceedings on November 21, 2005, and filed a second discovery request on March 28, 2006. By order dated May 11, 2006, the AJ granted the appellant's motions to compel discovery with regard to various matters, including records of compensatory time requests and approvals at PRAO (first discovery request, Document Request No. 15), the appellant's work product (second discovery request, Document Request No. 1), and the work product of other PRAO auditors from the time they worked as a GS-12 to the time they were promoted to the GS-13 level or higher from January 1998 to the present (second discovery request, Document Request Nos. 2 &#x0026; 3). The AJ initially ordered the agency to serve its discovery responses by May 23, 2006, but subsequently extended the deadline to May 25, 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 23, 2006, the agency filed a motion requesting, among other things, that it be relieved of its obligation to comply with the May 11, 2006 discovery order until the parties signed a standard protective order. It further requested an extension until June 9, 2006, in which to assert a claim of privilege. The agency proposed to make all non-privileged documents responsive to Document Requests Nos. 2 &#x0026; 3 available at the PRAO for inspection and copying beginning June 5, 2006, at the appellant's expense. The agency further indicated that it was prepared to immediately send documents responsive to most of the remaining document requests and would mail any remaining non-privileged documents by June 16, 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ responded on May 25, 2006. He entered a standard protective order, but denied the agency's request to make discovery contingent upon the appellant's signing a confidentiality agreement, and also denied the agency's request for an extension of the deadline for asserting a claim of privilege. He granted the agency's request to make documents responsive to Document Request Nos. 2 &#x0026; 3 available for inspection and copying at the PRAO on the week of June 5, 2006, but denied the agency's request to impose costs on the appellant. The AJ further ordered that the documents identified by the agency as immediately available, including those relating to Document Request No. 15, be served for receipt by May 31, 2006. He granted the agency an extension until June 2, 2006 to provide the appellant with the remaining documents at issue in the May 11, 2006 discovery order, including Document Request No. 1.<span class="Italic"></span> These were the final extensions granted by the AJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency produced some documents on May 30 and June 1, 2006, but none were responsive to Document Request Nos. 1 or 15. On June 12, 2006, the appellant's attorney sent a letter to the agency's counsel, indicating that she would file a motion for sanctions if the remaining documents were not produced by June 23, 2006. However, the parties agreed to reschedule the inspection and copying of documents relating to Document Request Nos. 2 and 3 for July 10, 2006, with deposition of agency witnesses to follow later that week. On July 6, 2006, the appellant's attorney sent another letter to the agency, stating that she would file a motion for sanctions if documents responsive to Document Request Nos. 1 and 15 were not compiled, copied, and ready to pick up from PRAO on July 10. The agency did not respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the appellant and his attorney arrived at the PRAO on July 10, 2006, the agency had not copied documents responsive to Document Requests Nos. 1 and 15, and had not identified and segregated from other business records documents responsive to Document Requests Nos. 2 &#x0026; 3. The appellant and his attorney reviewed and identified for copying most of the appellant's own work product. However, the appellant's assist audit work from the Dallas and Denver Regional Audit Offices was not made available. Moreover, due to time constraints, they were unable to review other records at the PRAO, including compensatory time records or the work product of other PRAO employees. The depositions of agency witnesses took place later that week, as scheduled. As of July 30, <span id="Page_1292"></span>2006, the agency had provided no documents responsive to Document Request No. 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a motion for sanctions on August 1, 2006. By order dated August 25, 2006, the AJ granted the motion, finding that the agency had failed to comply with his order with respect to Document Requests Nos. 1 and 15. He further found that, while the agency had technically complied with respect to Document Requests Nos. 2 and 3, its noncompliance with the obligation to produce the appellant's work records "substantially impaired" the appellant's ability to review the work product of other auditors. He concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant's discovery records were extensive, and as the agency points out, it provided a significant number of documents to him. Moreover, it does not appear to me that the agency exhibited bad faith in its efforts to comply with my discovery orders. Nevertheless, even if not in bad faith, its efforts fell short of the due diligence required of a party in discovery matters; I specifically reject its assertion that it has simply been a victim of a "game of discovery gotcha." I find that to preserve the ends of justice the agency must be sanctioned for its noncompliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Accordingly, I impose the following sanction: the agency is barred from asserting the affirmative defense that it would not have promoted the appellant and would not have granted him compensatory time absent any protected disclosure he may have made. This sanction is tailored to address the specific harm to the appellant from the agency's noncompliance with my discovery orders. A greater sanction, in my view, would be overly punitive, and a lesser sanction would be insufficiently remedial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ subsequently extended the scope of the sanction, barring the agency from submitting or relying on any evidence relating to the strengths or weaknesses of the personnel actions at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the agency failed to exercise due diligence in complying with the May 11, 2006 discovery order, and that evidentiary sanctions are therefore warranted as necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a); <span class="Italic">Roth v. Department of Transportation,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 172, 175-76 (1992),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 988 F.2d 130 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). We further observe that the AJ's chosen sanction, while unquestionably serious, is not outcome determinative. Throughout this appeal, the agency has had a fair opportunity to argue that the appellant did not meet his burden of proof--i.e., that he did not make protected disclosures, or that his disclosures were not a contributing factor in the decision not to promote him. It has argued each of these points aggressively, albeit without success. However, had the agency been permitted to assert its affirmative defense--i.e., that it would not have promoted the appellant or granted his request for compensatory time even in the absence of his disclosures--its noncompliance with the discovery order would have deprived the appellant of a fair opportunity to rebut the agency's argument.[10] Under these circumstances, we find that the AJ properly exercised his discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The agency's noncompliance directly implicates the first of these factors. The agency argues that there is no reason it should be prevented from introducing evidence relating to the remaining factors, and that the sanction is therefore overly broad. If so, this was harmless error, as it would be impossible for the agency to prevail in its affirmative defense without presenting evidence in support of its action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McIntire v. FEMA</span>, 55 MSPR 578, 585 (1992) (AJ could draw an adverse inference against the weight of the testimony of a witness when the agency failed to comply with a discovery order requiring production of investigatory notes of that witness).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Foreclosure of an agency case should not be commonplace. <span class="Italic">Ingalls Shipbuilding v. United States</span>, 857 F.2d 1448, 1451 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In <span class="Italic">Ingalls</span>, the Federal Circuit resolved as improper a sanction that effectively dismissed the government's key defense to a contract case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he sanction is inappropriate because the government was, perhaps understandably, confused about the scope of its discovery obligations. "[A]party's simple negligence, grounded in confusion or sincere misunderstanding of the Court's orders, [does not] warrant dismissal." <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Segona</span>, 621 F.2d 763, 768 (5th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Montee v. DOJ</span>, 84 MSPR 1, 5-6 &#x00B6; 12 (1999), emphasized that sanctions are used only when there is no other way to ensure cooperation with discovery procedures. In <span class="Italic">Montee</span>, the agency was sanctioned by the AJ when another agency refused to turn over records necessary to the appellant's defense. During the pendency of an interlocutory appeal on the discovery and sanctions issues, the agency in control of the documents produced them to the appellant. Despite the necessity for extensive litigation and delay in document production, the Board declined to permit imposition of sanctions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sanctions may be imposed only insofar as warranted to preserve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Montgomery v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 MSPR 435 (1998), and cases cited therein. They are to be imposed only when a party fails to exercise due diligence in complying with a Board order or exhibits negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 MSPR 597, 603 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 119 F.3d 16, 1997 WL 368381 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). Good faith efforts falling short of full compliance with an order are to be considered in determining whether a sanction is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Crespo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 53 MSPR 125, 130-31 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Macon v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 46 MSPR 410, 415 (1990) (although the appellant did not show good cause for his complete failure to comply with certain of the administrative judge's orders, the fact that he had made "some effort" to comply with the orders was a reason not to impose sanctions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant's response to the show cause order contends that the agency has acted in bad faith but provides no support for that conclusion other than the statement that the agency did not previously supply the requested documents. Here, the fact that the discovery materials have been provided is significant, and, under the circumstance in this case, dispositive. <span class="Italic">See Tropiak v. Department of the Army</span>, 59 MSPR 274, 279-80 (1993) (finding no error in the administrative judge's determination that sanctions would serve no purpose where the material had been provided and there was no evidence of prejudice to the appellant, albeit the production was only briefly delayed). In the appeal now under review, the appellant has not argued, now that he has the materials for which he fought, that he nonetheless remains subject to any degree of prejudice as a result of the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we conclude that to the extent that sanctions may ever have been warranted, they no longer remain so. Upon the successful attainment of the goal of its good faith efforts to gain the documents sought in discovery, the agency is, apparently, now in full compliance, prejudice has not been shown, and we see no way in which the ends of justice would be aided by remanding the sanctions issue for the administrative judge's further deliberation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Requena v. DHS</span>, DA-1221-16-0488-W-3 (NP 12/6/2022), left stand an AJ's ruling that sanctions requested by the appellant were unwarranted and that sanctions imposed on the agency were unreasonable</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the appellant's renewed motion for sanctions, which she filed after the administrative judge had imposed the sanction of limiting the number of agency witnesses, the administrative judge found that the appellant had failed to justify additional sanctions and denied the motion. An administrative judge may impose sanctions upon a party for failure to comply with an order, provided that the sanction is necessary to serve the ends of justice. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a). Sanctions should be imposed only when a party has failed to exercise basic due diligence in complying with an order or has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="italic">Armstrong v. Department of Justice</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 25 (2007), <span class="italic">overruled on other grounds by Edwards v. Department of Labor</span>, 2022 MSPB 9. In determining whether sanctions are appropriate, good faith efforts short of full compliance must be considered. <span class="italic">Id</span>. The imposition of sanctions is a matter within the administrative judge's sound discretion, and absent a showing that such discretion has been abused, his determination will not be found to constitute reversible error. <span class="italic">Smets v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 164, &#x00B6; 11 (2011), <span class="italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 498 F. App'x 1 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not identify on review the nature of the information she sought below, nor does she explain how the sanction she seeks is necessary to serve the ends of justice. Moreover, the documents in question appear related to a discovery dispute involving claims of privilege raised by the agency, which offered to submit the disputed documents to the administrative judge for an <span class="italic">in camera</span> review or produce them subject to a protective order. The administrative judge, however, did not conduct an <span class="italic">in camera</span> review or enter a protective order. Based on all of the above circumstances, the appellant has not shown a failure by the agency to exercise basic due diligence or bad faith warranting the sanction she suggests, nor has she otherwise shown an abuse of discretion by the administrative judge in denying her motion. The cases relied upon by the appellant are distinguishable from this appeal. <span class="italic">See Armstrong</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25, 27-28, 32 (finding no abuse of discretion by the administrative judge in barring the agency from asserting its IRA affirmative defense when it failed to produce documents despite the administrative judge having entered a protective order and <span id="Page_1293"></span>denied its request for an extension of time to assert a privilege claim); <span class="italic">Montgomery v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 435, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-5, 9-10, 16-17 (1998) (finding no abuse of discretion in imposing sanctions when the agency failed to produce documents for an <span class="italic">in camera</span> inspection and respond to repeated telephone messages from the administrative judge).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the imposition of sanctions is a matter within the administrative judge's sound discretion. <span class="italic">Smets</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 164, &#x00B6; 11. Although the agency states why it believes the administrative judge's actions were erroneous and makes a general statement that it was prejudiced by those actions, it does not articulate what the excluded witnesses would have testified to or explain how their testimony would affect the result reached in this case. Thus, the agency has not established that any alleged abuse of discretion or error by the administrative judge was prejudicial. <span class="italic">See Butler v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 313, 318 (1997); <span class="italic">Best v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 670, 673 (1993); <span class="italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984); <span class="italic">see also Jones v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 18 (holding that the Board will not find reversible error in an administrative judge's discovery rulings absent an abuse of discretion that prejudiced the party's substantive rights), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 544 F. App'x 976 (Fed. Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions involving the preclusion of testimony from an agency witness that were likely case-determinative were affirmed when the agency failed to list the witness in the initial disclosures once required under Board regulations, <span class="Italic">Brunner v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BRUNNER_MICHAEL_L_SF_0752_10_0274_I_1_ORDER_WITH_SEPARATE_DISSENTING_OPINION_635782.pdf">116 MSPR 679</a>, 2011 MSPB 79 (NP 8/31/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge denied the agency's request for Kreuziger's testimony because the agency did not identify Kreuziger in its initial disclosures. We find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of this sanction because the agency's omission of the polygraph examiner from its initial disclosure reflected, at best, a lack of due diligence. Specifically, given the agency's reliance on the polygraph to support its action against the appellant, its oversight in identifying the examiner in its initial disclosure could, and apparently did, mislead appellant's counsel into believing that the agency was not going to rely on him as a witness. We also reject the notion that the agency complied with its disclosure obligation because the examiner's name appeared in the report of investigation which it submitted to the appellant as part of the agency file.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ's actions may be reviewed to determine whether sanctions should have been imposed but were not. In an especially egregious case of discovery abuse involving the refusal of OPM to respond to an order compelling answers to interrogatories, the AJ failed to impose a sufficient sanction by allowing the appellant in a disability retirement case to submit secondary evidence. (The value of the sanction was doubtful: the appellant had the right to submit hearsay with or without approval of the AJ.) <span class="Italic">Julson v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 178, 182-83, 7 MSPB 655 (1981) (sanctioning OPM's discovery failings by striking its response to the appeal as well as its submissions); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stone v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPR 68, 71, 5 MSPB 142 (1981) (sanctioning OPM's failure to obey a discovery order: "we shall consider only appellant's testimony and submissions"). The Board may use a sanction to vary the usual processing of the PFR. After OPM failed to assemble, tab or file documents pursuant to the order of a AJ, the Board sanctioned OPM by refusing to consider its response to the appellant's PFR. <span class="Italic">Bradsher v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 694, 697 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If sanctions are imposed for failure to comply with discovery requirements, it is not sufficient to object to the sanctions. The agency must articulate what prejudice resulted from the sanctions. <span class="Italic">Best v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 670, 673 (1993), explained regarding the agency's protestations that the AJ erred by excluding testimony of witnesses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the agency states why it believes that the administrative judge's actions were erroneous, it does not articulate what the excluded witnesses would have testified to, or explain how the testimony affects the result reached in this case. Thus, the agency has not established that the administrative judge's alleged error was prejudicial....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency's failure to provide information during discovery may lead the Board to conclude that the agency failed to support its case properly, although the process followed may not be deemed a sanction. <span class="Italic">Mason v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 584, 588 (1996), provides an example of a reversal of an agency's action on a charge that was unspecific, an agency discovery response that failed to provide the specifics the appellant needed to present a defense, and the agency's belated provision of specifics at the Board hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly found, the agency's notice provided enough detail regarding the kind of misconduct charged (racial slurs), but it did not indicate when or where the charged misconduct took place. The appellant tried to learn these facts through discovery but was informed that the agency had no such information. At the hearing, however, he heard from the agency's witnesses that the charged misconduct had allegedly occurred three to four years earlier. The lack of specificity in the agency's notice thus clearly caused the appellant surprise at the hearing and affected him detrimentally because he could not obtain any information regarding the time and location of the charged misconduct until the agency's witnesses offered details on those matters at the hearing. As the appellant rightly complains, receipt of more specific information about the time and location of the alleged incidents would perhaps have allowed him to determine whether he was working on the dates in question and whether there were any other individuals who might have heard the remarks attributed to him. Without that specific information, the appellant had no alternative but to present a very general defense through his witnesses, a defense which the administrative judge rejected as insufficient to rebut the testimony of the agency's witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, then, we find that the agency's failure to give the appellant adequately detailed notice prior to the hearing of the alleged misconduct prejudiced his ability to mount a meaningful defense and denied him due process. <span class="Italic">See Barresi</span>, 65 MSPR at 666; <span class="Italic">Ragolia</span>, 52 MSPR at 302. Such a denial of an employee's right to fundamental due process requires reversal of an agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Daniel v. Veterans Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 459, 461-62 (1995); <span class="Italic">Barresi</span>, 65 MSPR at 666-67. We therefore reverse the agency's suspension of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant must act to preserve sanctions requested against an agency if the problems leading to the sanction motions were ostensibly resolved by the AJ during the appeal. If the appellant wishes to press on with requests for sanctions after discovery disputes are apparently resolved, the appellant must renew her motions for sanctions or preserve an objection to the AJ's rulings on discovery motions. By failing to object to the AJ, the appellant loses the opportunity for the objections to be heard by the Board on PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 539, 556 (1994); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 666, 680 n.1 (1997) (no error by an AJ who allowed the agency to introduce documents not produced during discovery to an appellant who failed to file a motion to compel the agency to produce the information).
