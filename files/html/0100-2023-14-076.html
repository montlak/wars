<p class="Body-Text">Thomas Jefferson spoke of "equal and exact justice to all men" an element of "the creed of our political faith, the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust." Even-handed application of discipline has traditionally been of singular importance in the administration of "just cause" provisions of labor contracts in the private sector. Disparate treatment is a mitigating factor that will be considered once the Board determines that the adverse action is otherwise proper. <span class="Italic">Tucker v. VA</span>, 11 MSPR 131, 133 n.1 (1982); <span class="Italic">see Bencomo v. DHS</span>, 115 MSPR 621, 625 &#x00B6; 11, 2011 MSPB 22 (2011) ("An appellant's allegation that the agency treated him disparately to another employee, without a claim of prohibited discrimination, is an allegation of disparate penalties to be proven by the appellant and considered by the Board in determining the reasonableness of the penalty, but it is not an affirmative defense."); <span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 255, 261 (1998) (in absence of a claim of prohibited discrimination, an allegation of disparate treatment is a mitigating factor, not an affirmative defense); <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 MSPR 74, 75 (1985) (restating <span class="Italic">Tucker</span>); <span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. DOJ</span>, 21 MSPR 428, 430 n.1 (1984) (disparate treatment goes to mitigation, not to an element of the charges). [Compare discussion involving EEO affirmative defenses in Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-034.html#sec12-34">Comparable Employees; Disparate Treatment</a>"; and in Chapter 13 (discussing prohibited personnel practices) to "Comparator Employees," and in Chapter 9 (discussing performance cases) to "Comparison of Employees' Performance."] Exempted from comparability analysis is the adverse action based on loss of a required security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Munoz v. DHS</span>, 121 MSPR 483, 489-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16, 2014 MSPB 66 (2014) (indefinite suspension based on suspension, then revocation, of a security clearance). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-122.html#sec6-121">Alternatives to Suspension</a>" for <span class="Italic">Munoz</span>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2020, OPM issued regulations addressing comparator analysis. How much emphasis will be placed on the regulation, or past law, in the future remains to be seen. Under 5 CFR 752.202 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Employees should be treated equitably. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time. An agency should consider appropriate comparators as the agency evaluates a potential disciplinary action. Appropriate comparators to be considered are primarily individuals in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, who engaged in the same or similar misconduct. Proposing and deciding officials are not bound by previous decisions in earlier similar cases, but should, as they deem appropriate, consider such decisions consonant with their own managerial authority and responsibilities and independent judgment. For example, a supervisor is not bound by his or her predecessor whenever there is similar conduct. A minor indiscretion for one supervisor based on a particular set of facts can amount to a more serious offense under a different supervisor. Nevertheless, they should be able to articulate why a more or less severe penalty is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2022, OPM revised its regulations to delete Subsection (d). 87 Fed. Reg. 67765 (Nov. 10, 2022). [Refer to March 5, 2021, OPM <span class="Italic">Guidance for Implementation of Executive Order 14003-Protecting the Federal Workforce</span>. <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-executive-order-14003-protecting-federal-workforce">https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-executive-order-14003-protecting-federal-workforce</a> as to continuing validity of regulations issued by OPM under the 2018 Executive Orders.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be credited by the Board, a claim of dissimilar treatment must be factually substantiated,<span class="Italic"> Trujillo v. DHS,</span> DA-0752-10-0436-I-2 (NP 6/29/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that he was treated less favorably than other employees who were charged with falsification, but he does not cite any evidence that the circumstances surrounding the behavior of other employees charged with falsification were substantially similar to those surrounding the appellant's behavior.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reonal v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-12-0589-I-1 (NP 8/5/2013), added that the appellant must make at least a minimal showing of disparate treatment to shift the defensive burden to the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we concur with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to make his threshold showing of a claim of disparate penalties. Both before the administrative judge and on review, the appellant only makes general allegations that he feels he was treated differently than other employees; in making this generic claim, however, the appellant fails to provide the required specificity that would shift the burden to the agency to articulate a legitimate basis for the differing treatment, <span class="Italic">see Downey v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 11 (2013).

Moreover, as noted by the administrative judge, the agency submitted evidence of similar discipline imposed on other employees in the appellant's work unit for theft of mail, thus further eroding the appellant's disparate penalties claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2022, the Board decided that analysis of comparability needed a substantial rewrite, and that occurred in <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), overruling some decisions (that follow). Among the revisions offered by <span class="Italic">Singh</span>, comparability analysis is for the same types of offenses, not for different offenses of comparable severity; analysis is limited to those employees whose misconduct or other circumstances closely resemble those of the appellant; comparability analysis does not extend to nation-wide searches for comparators in agencies with employees throughout the country or elsewhere in the world; there must be a close connection between the misconduct or some other factor for an employee from another work unit or supervisory chain to be a proper comparator for disparate penalty purposes; and while one employee receives a more severe penalty than that imposed on a comparator who has committed the same or similar misconduct should be considered in favor of mitigating the penalty in a given case, mitigation is not always required. The precedential <span class="Italic">Singh</span> decision explained, as it determined that the inquiry should consider whether whether the agency knowingly treated employees differently in a way not justified by the facts, and intentionally for reasons other than the efficiency of the service, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-20:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's disparate penalty claim does not provide a basis for reversing the initial decision</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he was denied discovery regarding the agency's treatment of other employees who engaged in similar misconduct. He speculates that such discovery would have revealed that the agency treated similarly situated employees more leniently. Before we address the appellant's arguments relating to discovery, we take this opportunity to reinstate our former law governing the analysis of disparate penalty claims and thereby overrule <span class="Italic">Figueroa v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 422 (2013); <span class="Italic">Villada v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268 (2010); <span class="Italic">Woebcke v.

Social Security Administration</span>, 586 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009), discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that among the factors an agency should consider in setting the penalty for misconduct is "consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses." <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). For decades after <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> was decided, for a disparate penalty claim to succeed, the Board required close similarity in offenses between the appellant and any comparator(s), and that the appellant and the comparator(s) worked in the same unit and for the same supervisors. <span class="Italic">E.g., Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 7 (2005); <span class="Italic">Fearon v. Department of Labor</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 428, &#x00B6; 11 (2005); <span class="Italic">Rasmussen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In a series of cases issued in 2010, however, the Board changed its approach to disparate penalty claims. Under the new precedent, broad similarity in misconduct between the appellant and the comparator(s) was sufficient to shift the burden to the agency to explain the difference in treatment, and the universe for potential comparators was seemingly limitless. <span class="Italic">See Figueroa</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 10-12; <span class="Italic">Villada</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12; <span class="Italic">Woebcke</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In announcing its "more flexible approach" to disparate penalties claims, the Board relied in large part on a 2009 decision from our reviewing court. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 586 F.3d 1365, the Federal Circuit remanded an appeal to the Board for further development of the record as to the agency's treatment of an alleged comparator. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368-69. Previously in that case, the administrative judge had found the comparator evidence irrelevant because the comparator was not in the same chain of command as the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368. The court found that "[w]hile the fact that two employees are supervised under different chains of command may sometimes justify different penalties," the record before it did not justify the alleged disparity in treatment, particularly because the appellant was a mere participant in a tax fraud scheme orchestrated by the comparator. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368-69. Applying <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Board in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> held that there must be enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly situated employees differently, but that the Board would not have "hard and fast rules regarding the 'outcome determinative' nature of these factors." <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15, 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the binding precedent of <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, a comparator need not always have to be in the same work unit or under the same supervisor.[3] <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 586 F.3d at 1368-69. Thus, the Board's pre-<span class="Italic">Williams</span> statements to the contrary are no longer valid. Nevertheless, while no single factor is outcome determinative, the fact that two employees come from different work units and/or supervisory chains remains an important factor in determining whether it is appropriate to compare the penalties they are given. In most cases, employees from another work unit or supervisory chain will not be proper comparators. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the court emphasized the fact that the comparator had originated and organized a tax fraud scheme in which Mr. Williams was one of several participants. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1366-69. Given the unusually close connection between the two employees' misconduct in that case, the court found that the agency needed to justify the alleged disparity in the discipline they received.[4] The unique circumstances in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> illustrate that there must be a close connection between the misconduct or some other factor for an employee from another work unit or supervisory chain to be a proper comparator for disparate penalty purposes. The universe of potential comparators will vary from case to case, but it should be limited to those employees whose misconduct and/or other circumstances closely resemble those of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A panel of the Federal Circuit recently held that "[a] comparator employee is an employee that 'was in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, and was subjected to the same standards governing discipline.'" <span class="Italic">Miskill v. Social Security Administration</span>, 863 F.3d 1379, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>). To the extent this statement can be read as an absolute requirement that comparator employees be in the same work unit with the same supervisor, it conflicts with the prior panel decision in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, in which the court held that "the fact that two employees are supervised under different chains of command <span class="Italic">may sometimes</span> justify different penalties." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 586 F.3d at 1368 (emphasis supplied). We remain bound by <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the earlier panel decision. <span class="Italic">See Deckers Corporation v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Mr. Williams alleged that the agency reemployed the comparator, an assertion the agency disputed. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 586 F.3d at 1368-69. The court remanded the appeal for further development of the factual record. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, a panel of the Federal Circuit held that when an employee raises an allegation that he received more severe discipline than another employee, the proper inquiry is whether the agency <span class="Italic">knowingly</span> treated employees differently "in a way not justified by the facts, and intentionally for reasons other than the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Facer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 836 F.2d 535, 539 (Fed. Cir. 1988). To the extent the panel in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> intended to remove the knowledge portion of the disparate penalty analysis, as we similarly noted, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in footnote 3, we are bound to follow the court's previous analysis, as set forth in the court's earlier panel decision in <span class="Italic">Facer</span>, which includes the knowledge portion. <span class="Italic">See Deckers Corporation v. United States</span>, 752 F.3d 949, 959, 966 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that, "[i]n this Circuit, a later panel is bound by the determinations of a prior panel, unless relieved of that obligation by an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> order of the court or a decision of the Supreme Court[ ]"). Thus, we overrule <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> and subsequent cases to the extent they have deviated from the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Facer</span>. In assessing an agency's penalty determination, the relevant inquiry is whether the agency knowingly and unjustifiably treated employees differently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since 2010, the Board has used its "flexible" approach to disparate penalty claims as a basis for mitigating agency-imposed penalties. For example, in <span class="Italic">Portner v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-6, 9, 16-22 (2013), the Board mitigated the removal of a supervisor who operated his official Government vehicle (OGV) and made multiple false statements to agency employees and the police regarding his actions in an attempt to hide the fact that he parked the OGV in a parking lot adjacent to a Hooters restaurant, where he consumed alcohol and ate dinner. In reducing the penalty to a 45-day suspension, the Board relied in part on evidence that other employees who had been charged with misuse of an OGV and other misconduct had received lesser penalties, even though none of the comparators had been charged with both misuse of an OGV and making false statements, like the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-22. The Board found that, although the misconduct of the comparators was not the same as the appellant's, it "appear[ed] at least as serious as the appellant's wrongdoing" and that the agency failed to offer a sufficient explanation for the significantly harsher penalty imposed on the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 20-29 (2012), the Board affirmed an administrative judge's decision mitigating the removal of a mail handler who was arrested near agency property while on duty and later convicted of a felony, unlawful possession of a controlled substance. In mitigating the removal to a 90-day suspension, the administrative judge cited another employee who worked at the same facility as the appellant and was not removed after being charged with drug possession. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 11, 13. The Board recognized several differences between the appellant's circumstances and those of the comparator, including that the comparator was charged with possession of marijuana only, whereas the appellant was charged with possession of both cocaine and marijuana, and that the comparator was not arrested on or near agency property. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22. Nevertheless, the Board determined that the comparison between the two penalties was appropriate because the comparator had engaged in "a more serious act" by attempting to smuggle marijuana into a prison facility. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's disparate penalty analysis in cases like <span class="Italic">Portner</span> and <span class="Italic">Boucher</span> represents a departure from the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, which calls for comparison with penalties "imposed upon other employees <span class="Italic">for the same or similar offenses</span>." <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305 (emphasis added). The Board in <span class="Italic">Portner</span> and <span class="Italic">Boucher</span> did not find that the comparators had engaged in the same or similar offenses as the appellants. Instead, the Board found comparisons of the penalties appropriate in those cases because the comparators' misconduct was "as serious as" or "more serious" than that of the appellants. <span class="Italic">Portner</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 22; <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 22. We overrule <span class="Italic">Portner</span> and <span class="Italic">Boucher</span> to the extent they held that the disparate penalty analysis should extend beyond the same or similar offenses. The Board should not attempt to weigh the relative seriousness of various offenses in order to determine whether two employees who committed different acts of misconduct were treated disparately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses is simply one of a nonexhaustive list of 12 factors that are relevant for consideration in determining the appropriateness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06. The Board has frequently stated that the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibility, is the most important factor in assessing the reasonableness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">E.g., Batara v. Department of the Navy</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 8 (2016); <span class="Italic">Spencer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 132, &#x00B6; 7 (2009). Under the Board's post-<span class="Italic">Lewis</span> standard, in some cases the consistency of the penalty has become not only more important than any of the other <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, it has become the sole outcome determinative factor. We hereby reiterate that the consistency of the penalty is just one of many relevant factors to be considered in determining an appropriate penalty. Therefore, while the fact that one employee receives a more severe penalty than that imposed on a comparator who has committed the same or similar misconduct should be considered in favor of mitigating the penalty in a given case, mitigation is by no means required in all such cases. There often will be a range of penalties that would fall within the tolerable limits of reasonableness in a given case. That an agency chooses to impose a penalty at the more lenient end of that range in one case should not mean that it cannot impose a penalty at the more severe end of that range in another case.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;There is no guarantee that a prior agency penalty determination even fell within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. Thus, the consistency called for under <span class="Italic">Villada</span>, <span class="Italic">Woebcke</span>, and <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> might be rooted in an earlier disciplinary decision that was unwise, meaning that a manager could be forced to go easy on an employee who committed serious misconduct because of the <span class="Italic">unwarranted</span> leniency of some other manager in the past.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of our reinstatement of the former legal standard for analyzing disparate penalty claims, we now turn to the appellant's argument that he was improperly denied discovery regarding potential comparators. Specifically, the appellant sought information regarding the treatment of employees agency-wide who had engaged in similar misconduct. The agency objected to the appellant's request as overbroad and limited its response to employees at the Los Angeles P&DC. The appellant reiterated his request for agency-wide information. The agency reiterated its objections, but it did supplement its discovery response with information regarding EAS employees within the Pacific Area (i.e., California and Hawaii) who were charged with arguably similar misconduct over the prior 2 years. The appellant asked the administrative judge to compel the agency to produce information about potential comparators agency-wide. The administrative judge denied the appellant's motion to compel, finding the requests to be "overbroad and burdensome and not likely to lead to the discovery of relevant admissible evidence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has broad discretion in ruling on discovery matters, and absent an abuse of discretion the Board will not find reversible error in such rulings. <span class="Italic">Kingsley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 16 (2016). We find no abuse of discretion in this matter, particularly in light of the above reinstatement of our former legal standard for analyzing disparate penalty claims. The agency provided information regarding potential comparators within reasonable geographic and temporal limits. Information regarding the treatment of employees across the country is simply not likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence regarding whether the agency knowingly and unjustifiably treated employees differently.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Post</span> <span class="Italic">Singh</span>, as to comparators in different work units, if the agency cites a comparator in its proposal notice, the Board will consider it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="Body-Text">In 2010, at the behest of the Federal Circuit, the Board shifted away from an analysis requiring near identity in circumstances of the appellant and another employee to serve as a comparator.

In the past, the Board has considered some of these factors, such as whether the appellant and the comparator were in the same work unit, as outcome determinative; if the "comparator" was not in the same work unit, there could be no determination that disparate penalties were imposed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Von Muller,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 91, &#x00B6; 22 ("With the exception of Hoyle, who was also removed, no other target of the agency's investigation was in <span id="Page_2375"></span>the appellant's work unit....

<p class="Body-Text">Although the analysis has changed as to what constitutes a comparator, now as before, when an employee raises an allegation of disparate penalties in comparison to specified employees, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence before the penalty can be upheld. <span class="Italic">Ellis v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although there are decisions post-dating <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, subsequently discussed, examining comparability, there are relatively few Board decisions mitigating penalties determined upon a disparity analysis.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation that the agency treated him disparately to another employee, without a claim of prohibited discrimination, is an allegation of disparate penalties to be proven by the appellant and considered by the Board in determining the reasonableness of the penalty, but it is not an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Vargas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). The consistency of the penalty is only one of the factors to be considered under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> in determining the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Defense,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 546, 552, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Moreover, where an imposed penalty is appropriate for the sustained charge(s), an allegation of disparate penalties is not a basis for reversal or mitigation of the penalty unless the agency knowingly and intentionally treated similarly-situated employees differently or if the agency decides to begin levying a more severe penalty for a certain offense without giving notice of the change in policy. <span class="Italic">See Whelan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 13 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 231 Fed. Appx. 965 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 255, 261-62 (1998). To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983). We find that requirement satisfied under the circumstances of this case because the disciplinary actions taken against the appellant and the two comparative employees were the result of the agency's unified response to the OIG findings of veterans' benefits documents in shred bins in all four of the regional offices investigated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's evidence regarding the two comparative employees, who were disciplined as a result of the agency's unified response to the OIG investigation, shows that the agency proposed to remove those two employees for having 28 veterans' benefits-related documents and 87 veterans' benefits-related documents in their shred bins respectively....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both of the removal proposals were issued to the comparative employees on October 23, 2008, prior to the removal proposal issued to the appellant on November 7, 2008. The agency mitigated the removal proposal for the employee with 28 veterans' benefits-related documents in his shred bin to a 15-day suspension. The agency mitigated the removal proposal of the employee with 87 veterans' benefits-related documents in his shred bin to a 30-day suspension. The decision notices were issued to both of the comparative employees on November 21, 2008, prior to the removal decision notice issued to the appellant on November 29, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, an employee raises an allegation of disparate penalties in comparison to specified employees, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence before the penalty can be upheld. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 8 (2009); <span class="Italic">Woody v. General Services Administration,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 486, 488 (1981). The record reflects that the agency failed to explain its disparate treatment of employees disciplined as a result of its unified action in response to the OIG investigation, despite the appellant's record evidence of that disparate treatment. We find that the agency failed to prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Lewis,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 8. We also find that the agency improperly imposed a more severe penalty for the same misconduct without giving prior notice of a change in its policy. <span class="Italic">See Jefferies,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. at 261-62. Thus, we find that a 30-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty given the penalties the agency imposed on the two comparative employees. <span class="Italic">See Tucker v. Veterans Administration,</span> 11 M.S.P.R. 131, 133-34 (1982). Accordingly, we VACATE that portion of the initial decision affirming the agency's removal penalty and we MITIGATE the removal penalty to a 30-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the 2010 <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> decision, Board law started to develop sporadically as to comparators, for the Board conducts the analysis on a case-by-case basis rather than through a multifactor analysis, as in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, established by a lead decision. As decisions are reviewed that were issued before <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, it should be understood that the earlier decisions were developed through a comparability analysis limited to similar offenses by individuals within the same organizational unit with nearly identical past disciplinary records. Earlier decisions provide some guidance; post-<span class="Italic">Lewis</span> decisions bear careful scrutiny. Complicating the analysis is the Board's position that if an allegation of disparity is tied to an assertion of discrimination under the civil rights laws, the ensuing disparity analysis follows EEOC decisions that impose essentially the rigid analysis that the Board followed before <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>. The result is that the comparability analysis is more oriented to the employee under <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> and its progeny if EEO considerations are not the sole basis of the disparity allegations. Some decisions will analyze disparities in penalties under both the more generous post-<span class="Italic">Lewis</span> analysis and, as to EEO allegations, under the less generous EEOC analysis. The Board would do well--being the Board--to apply the same approach to all cases raising an allegation of disparity and save the EEOC analysis only for those cases where disparity is found, mitigation or reversal of a penalty is required, and the remaining issue is one of whether the disparate treatment rises to the level of discrimination or reprisal that could entail an award of compensatory damages or other relief under the civil rights laws.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2376"></span>The defense of disparity of penalties can be raised based on evidence that similarly-situated employees received no discipline after committing conduct similar to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Fearon v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 99 MSPR 428, 434 &#x00B6; 11 (2005). To successfully argue a disparity in penalties, there must be situations comparable to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Powe v. USPS</span>, 282 Fed. Appx. 808, 810-11 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) ("Mr. Powe, however, did not present any evidence of penalties imposed on other employees for similar misconduct. Without such evidence, the absence of which is unsurprising given the uniqueness of Mr. Powe's offense, neither the agency nor the Board was required to consider this factor.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Restricted old law and evolving new law aside, "where an appellant raises an allegation of disparate treatment in comparison to specified employees, the agency must establish a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment before the penalty can be upheld." <span class="Italic">Wittenberg v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 617, 619-20 (1981).

Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 99, 101 (1984) (false information on a timecard was sustained but the penalty was mitigated on the basis of evidence that other supervisors charged with falsification offenses graver than the appellant's were given less severe penalties; it was insufficient for the agency to assert that it had made an effort to publicize a tougher policy against the falsification of timecards; the demotion was mitigated to a suspension); <span class="Italic">Landreth v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 680, 682 (1981) (removal for the fraudulent use of a government purchase document was mitigated to a 10-day suspension based on evidence showing similar suspensions by the agency of other employees who were charged with falsifying government travel vouchers, the attempted theft of government property, and the actual theft of government property); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. IRS</span>, 8 MSPR 536, 540 (1981) ("[W]here an appellant raises an allegation of disparate treatment in comparison to specified employees, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence a legitimate reason for the difference before the penalty can be upheld."); <span class="Italic">Simmins v.

<p class="Body-Text">A single charge may reasonably provide a range of penalties, each appropriate in a particular set of circumstances. <span class="Italic">Furlick v. EEOC</span>, 20 MSPR 71, 74 (1984). In the best case, consistency of penalties is but one factor considered in the mitigation analysis. <span class="Italic">Baker v. DHHS</span>, 41 MSPR 363, 368 (1989). In other than the hypothetical best case, however, the Board historically avoided intensive disparate penalty analysis. Nevertheless, the nonfrivolous allegation of disparity in penalties must be addressed by the AJ, although the Board may address the issue on PFR, should the AJ not provide the necessary analysis, if the record permits it to do so without a remand<span class="Italic">. See Lunny v. VA</span>, 7 MSPR 654, 657-59 (1981). But the disparity defense must at least be raised with the AJ to warrant consideration by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. DOJ</span>, 58 MSPR 96, 101 n.4 (1993) ("Because the appellant failed to timely object to the omission of the disparate treatment issue from the administrative judge's prehearing conference summary, and has stated no reason for failing to do so, we find that he is precluded from now raising that issue with respect to the former employee."); <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 82, 83 (1982) ("Appellant, however, did not specifically raise the disparity issue before the presiding official even though he was provided a hearing and had the opportunity to call witnesses on this issue."). If several levels of employees are involved in an incident, or in failing to prevent the incident, the Board discounts arguments of loss of trust in the appellant if the agency imposes comparatively light discipline on the higher-level employees. <span class="Italic">See Watkins v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The board seems to have got itself in the position of making extended inquiries into one case, while adjudicating another, to establish or refute a charge of disparate treatment.

This obviously means differently in a way not justified by the facts, and intentionally for reasons other than the efficiency of the service. We think, therefore, that the extensive comparisons between Facer's case and others, indulged in both by the AJ and by the board, are of doubtful relevancy here, unless they lead to a conclusion of willful discrimination.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Assuming viability to a mitigation argument based on disparate penalties, discussion begins with the theory of disparate penalty analysis under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. The burden is on the employer to come forward with details supporting a difference in treatment once the appellant identifies a disparity in result for the same offense. <span class="Italic">See Drummer v.

The proposed penalty is relevant to the disparity analysis. The ultimate disposition of the employee's case does not justify the agency's decision to propose disparate penalties. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 490, 492 (1984). If an appellant raises an allegation of disparate treatment in comparison to specified employees, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment before the penalty can be upheld.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the agency used disparate penalties.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that there were four other employees who were treated differently with respect to the penalty imposed.

Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 246, 248 n.* (1984), the Board is unclear concerning the appellant's burden of demonstrating disparate treatment. The initial proof from the employee need not always be specific.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge erred in finding that the penalty was reasonable. He contends that another employee was only given a three day suspension for offenses more serious than his. As the administrative judge found, however, the appellant failed to introduce into the record any evidence regarding this claim. He merely alleged at the hearing that he had obtained such evidence through discovery. In the absence of specific evidence concerning this allegation, the administrative judge did not err in concluding that the appellant was not differently treated from another employee....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Relatively early cases gave serious consideration to disparity defenses. When an agency offered no legitimate reason for disparate treatment of the appellant, the Board must consider the appropriateness of the agency-imposed penalty. In <span class="Italic">Filip v. VA</span>, 15 MSPR 329 (1983), the appellant brought an unauthorized weapon onto VA property, where he was employed as a police officer. The agency was aware that appellant and other agency police officers (including supervisors) occasionally carried handguns when traveling to and from work but took no action against any of them. The Board decided that a reprimand, the minimum penalty in the agency table of penalties for a first offense, was the maximum reasonable penalty. The appellant and his fellow police officers were not on notice that the offense would result in a disciplinary action as severe as removal. Another case involved an IRS criminal investigator removed for failure to pay $1,100 in past due balances on his tax returns; he had received some past discipline. But another criminal investigator was given only a three-day suspension for the same type of offense. The appellant's prior suspensions on unrelated charges did not explain the disparity in treatment. The removal was mitigated to a 60-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Gibbs v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 646, 651 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 317, 321, 8 MSPB 17 (1981)). A supervisor and employee were involved in a fight, provoked by the supervisor. The supervisor pulled a three-day suspension; the appellant was (what else?) removed. The Board mitigated the removal to a three-day suspension; the grossly disparate treatment of the individuals manifested bad faith justifying an award of counsel fees. <span class="Italic">Woodard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 614, 617 (1984). Removal for AWOL was reversed and reduced to a 30-day suspension for an appellant who presented evidence that after the record closed in his case another employee in the same work unit was given a 30-day suspension for essentially the same offense during the same general time period. <span class="Italic">Mille v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 248, 251-52 (1985). Mitigation may be required when the appellant presented evidence during a PFR that the agency took lesser action against another employee similarly situated following the issuance of the initial decision in the appellant's case. <span class="Italic">Shuff v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach toward an uneven penalty defense is uneven.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record thus documents at least 10 disciplinary violations on Squires's part: Three instances of leaving his assigned duty station without permission, two instances of failing to carry out a supervisor's instructions,...one instance of sleeping on duty, one instance of insubordination, and one instance of clocking out early. By comparison, the agency documented four disciplinary violations in effecting the appellant's removal: Two instances of leaving his assigned duty station without permission, one instance of insubordination, and one instance of sleeping on the job. Squires's violations thus encompassed each of the types of charges sustained against the appellant, plus additional offenses. Accordingly, we find that the appellant satisfied his burden to show a substantial similarity between his offenses and those of Stephen Squires.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may refute a charge of disparate treatment by establishing a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment, either by showing that the offenses in question were not really equivalent, or that mitigating or aggravating factors justified a difference in treatment.... The agency adduced no evidence tending to show that Squire's offenses were dissimilar to those of the appellant, or the existence of mitigating or aggravating factors justifying a difference in treatment. The deciding official conceded in his testimony that Squire's offenses appeared to be similar to those of the appellant, but stated that he was unfamiliar with the mitigating circumstances in Squire's case. It was the agency, however, not the appellant, that had the burden to demonstrate any significant difference in mitigating circumstances.... The agency did not meet that burden here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The consistency of a penalty with those imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses is only one factor to be considered in mitigation of an agency-imposed penalty, however.... We must therefore analyze the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in reviewing the reasonableness of the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Leaving a work site without permission and sleeping while on duty are both serious offenses that reflect unfavorably on an employee's dependability and upon the efficiency of the service.... [T]he appellant had only four years of satisfactory service, a more serious record of prior offenses, no excuse for falling asleep while on duty, and was on notice that further misbehavior could lead to his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found the appellant's demeanor at the hearing indicative of good potential for rehabilitation. We find, however, that the deciding official properly relied on the appellant's leaving the Shipyard without permission after meeting with the preaction investigator as showing the appellant's lack of rehabilitative potential. We further find that his actions in this regard are entitled to more weight than his hearing demeanor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the agency's removal action to be within the bounds of reasonableness when considered without regard to the consistency of the appellant's penalty with that imposed on Stephen Squires. We must next consider whether the disparate penalty imposed on Squires requires a different result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a penalty is otherwise appropriate, the existence of a disparate penalty imposed on another employee in the same work unit will not ordinarily require reversal or mitigation. <span class="Italic">See Yeager</span>, 39 MSPR at 151; <span class="Italic">Quander v. Department of Justice</span>, 22 MSPR 419, 420 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 180 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). Two qualifications must be added to this general proposition, however. First, an agency may not knowingly and intentionally treat similarly-situated employees differently.... Second, where an agency has consistently imposed a certain range of penalties for a certain type of offense, the agency may not start enforcing a more stringent penalty without giving its employees fair notice of its change in policy....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the record indicates that the agency consistently imposed lighter penalties on employees committing offenses substantially similar to those of the appellant. There is also no evidence that the agency consciously treated the appellant more harshly than it did Squires. The appellant's penalty was decided by a different official than was Squire's penalty. Captain Nickelsburg, the deciding official in this case, testified that he was unfamiliar with Squire's case when he decided the appellant's penalty, having reviewed only his own previous cases for consistency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that removal was a reasonable penalty under all the circumstances.</p>
