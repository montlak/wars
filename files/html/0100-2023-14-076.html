<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-77"><span class="space">2.</span> Light Duty</h4>
<p class="noindent">For years FLRA maintained that requiring the employer to assign duties compatible with the condition of an employee who was returning from a work injury was inconsistent with the right of the agency to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals and Marshals Serv.</span>, 15 FLRA 333, 335-36 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Int'l Plate Printers Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 113, 143-44 (1987) (Provisions 33 and 34, calling for agency to be given light duty work whenever possible to accommodate their condition were nonnegotiable infringements upon the right to assign work). A proposal that management attempt to secure light duty or other work for employees who were unable to perform regular duties due to illness or injury was nonnegotiable because management would have to reassign employees or redesign jobs. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 943 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq. Keesler Technical Training Ctr.,</span> 19 FLRA 949, 950-51 (1985). Based on the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Keesler</span>, another proposal that required the employer to make every effort to assign light duty for employees temporarily unable to perform all their duties because of illness or injury was nonnegotiable. The words "make every effort" were construed by FLRA to impose a substantive condition on management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 468 (1987) (Proposal 16).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1458 and DOJ, U.S. Attorney, S. Dist. Of Florida</span>, 29 FLRA 3, 13 (1987), declared negotiable a proposal that required the employer, to the extent possible and in accordance with applicable rules, regulations, and medical recommendations, to make every reasonable effort to grant temporary assignments of duties commensurate with the disability and qualifications of employees recuperating from illness or injury who are temporarily unable to perform their assigned duties:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's position, we do not find that the provision interferes with the management right to assign work. The provision does not absolutely prohibit the assignment of certain work as does, for example, Provision 2 found to be nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 1409 and Department of the Army, Adjutant General Publications Center</span>, 28 FLRA No. 22 (1987). The absence of an express obligation on the part of management to refrain from assigning certain duties or to tailor the employee's position to comport with his or her asserted disability distinguishes this provision from other "light duty" proposals we have reviewed. Moreover, we note that the provision requires that, in acting on an employee's written request, management comply with "applicable rules and regulations" in addition to medical recommendations. Thus, management would retain the discretion to not make such work assignments if it so chooses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, therefore, Provision 6 permits employees to request, for certifiable medical reasons, to perform less arduous work, for which they are qualified, than that which they are usually assigned, if such less arduous work is available for them to perform. The Agency is obligated to make a reasonable effort to grant requests for such available work only in accordance with "applicable rules and regulations." Consequently, we find Provision 6 to be a negotiable procedure....</p>
<p class="noindent">It is difficult to determine exactly what employees received under <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1458</span> that they lacked before the provision was proposed. But another light-duty proposal, considered in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 284 and Naval Air Technical Training Ctr., Lakehurst</span>, 29 FLRA 958, 960-61 (1987), suggested that when an employee becomes capable of performing light-duty work after an on-the-job injury, the employing department will make every reasonable effort to assign light-duty work consistent with the restrictions imposed by the activity clinic. The proposal was an appropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[O]nce the determination is made by the Agency's branch clinic that an employee should be placed in a "light duty" status, to require the Agency "to make every reasonable effort" to make work assignments which are consistent with the branch clinic's recommendations does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work. The limitations established by the provision are those recommended by the Agency's own officials. Moreover, management is not absolutely bound by those limitations, but is obligated to make reasonable efforts to comply. Management thus has some flexibility as to the implementation of the clinic's requirements. On balance, therefore, we conclude that the protection afforded employees against further job-related injury outweighs the detrimental impact on management's ability to accomplish its work load....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1...is distinguishable from...<span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 1409 and Department of the Army, U.S. Army Adjutant General Publications Center, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 28 FLRA No. 22 (1987). The provision in that case prevented the agency from assigning work to employees which conflicted with restrictions placed on the employees by "competent medical authority." In finding that the provision in that case excessively interfered with management's right to assign work, we concluded that the standard governing the assignment of work which was established by that provision was too broad. Moreover, the provision in that case expressly prohibited the assignment of duties to employees which conflicted in any manner with restrictions placed on the employees by competent medical authority. Provision 1...affords management a measure of flexibility in the assignment to employees of "light duty" work.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA advanced the <span class="Italic">Local 284</span> decision a tad in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2024 and Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 30 FLRA 16, 16 (1987), by approving for negotiation a proposal that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employee has been returned to work by the Employer's medical authority for a temporary, brief period of light duty, the Employer agrees to assign the type of work to the employee that will not aggravate his illness or injury when such work is available which he is qualified to perform. If the Employer is unable to provide such light duty, the Employer will approve a period of absence due to illness as recommended by its medical authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">Changes in the negotiability of proposals involving light duty continued with <span class="Italic">Bremerton Metal Trades Council and Naval Supply Ctr. Puget Sound</span>, 32 FLRA 643, 646, 647-48 (1988), resolving as nonnegotiable a proposal that "when an employee is assigned a temporary medical limitation because of a work related injury or illness, the Employer will make every effort to place the employee on a job, within prescribed restrictions." The decision indirectly explains how to draft proposals permitting negotiation of light-duty arrangements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reexamined the relationship between management's right to assign work...and employees' safety and health in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 1625 and Naval Air Station, Oceana, <span id="page_669"></span>VA</span>, 30 FLRA 1105, 1119 (1988) (Provision 6) (<span class="Italic">NAS, Oceana</span>). We stated that we would examine proposals requiring management to assign, or refrain from assigning, certain duties for safety and health reasons to determine whether proposals: (1) require management to adhere to restrictions on work assignments imposed by the agency's own medical authorities, or (2) impose restrictions independent of and/or inconsistent with those of the agency's medical authorities. We stated that proposals requiring that work be assigned in a manner consistent with restrictions imposed by the agency's medical authorities would constitute negotiable procedures under section 7106(b)(2). However, proposals restricting the assigning of work on grounds independent of and/or in conflict with those of the agency's own medical authorities would violate management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now apply the principles contained in <span class="Italic">NAS, Oceana</span> [<span class="Italic">Naval Air Station, Oceana</span>, 30 FLRA 1105, 1111 (1988)] to Provision 2 in this case. The provision is operative when an employee "is assigned a temporary medical limitation." The provision, however, does not specify who assigned the "medical limitation." In the absence of any such elaboration, we find that the provision would require management to follow limitations established by medical authorities other than the Agency's own. Therefore, the provision would impose restrictions on the assignment of work independent of any which might be imposed by Agency medical officers. Consequently, the provision interferes with management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent">Developments continued in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2096 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command, W. Region</span>, 36 FLRA 834, 838-39 (1990). The proposal was that management make a diligent effort to find light or alternative duty for those employees returning from sickness or injury, with temporary limitations imposed by their own physicians. The proposal was negotiable as an arrangement. FLRA signaled a change in direction:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We continue to adhere to the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">NAS, Oceana</span> [30 FLRA 1105 (1988)]...that proposals or provisions which require an agency to observe medical restrictions on work assignments which are imposed by the agency's own medical authorities do not directly interfere with the agency's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also continue to adhere to the Authority's holding...that requiring an agency to assign, or refrain from assigning, certain duties based on medical restrictions independent of those imposed by its own medical authorities directly interferes with the agency's right to assign work.... This is not to say, of course, that restrictions imposed by outside, or private, physicians are, from a medical standpoint, entitled to less weight than those imposed by agency authorities. Instead, our conclusion is based solely on the agency's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will no longer adhere to the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">NAS, Oceana</span>, however, that proposals or provisions which require an agency to observe medical restrictions independent of those imposed by its own authorities may not be "arrangements" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">Citing the impact of intervening court and FLRA decisions concerning "arrangements" bargaining, <span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Eng'g Command</span>, 36 FLRA at 840-41, continued:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find no statutory basis for the Authority's conclusion in <span class="Italic">NAS, Oceana</span> that a provision which seeks to eliminate possible adverse effects is not appropriate for consideration as an appropriate arrangement. We will, therefore, not employ this blanket rule. Instead, we will base determinations as to the negotiability of all proposed arrangements, including arrangements which seek to ameliorate the adverse effects of the exercise of a management right by inhibiting the exercise of that right, on evaluation of the facts and circumstances in each case.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although FLRA readily determined that the proposal in the <span class="Italic">Naval Eng'g Facilities Command</span> case directly interfered with management's right to assign work, it was an appropriate arrangement, 36 FLRA at 843-44:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We agree with the Union that the provision "affords employees already burdened by illness or injury a reasonable protection from additional threats to their health." The additional threats to employees' health reasonably could be anticipated to flow from management's exercise of its right to assign work incompatible with medical recommendations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether the proposed arrangement contemplated by Provision 1 is "appropriate,"...we must examine whether the negative impact on management's right to assign work is disproportionate to the benefits conferred by the provision on employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA at 33. That is, we must decide whether the provision excessively interferes with the right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 restricts management's ability to assign work by requiring the Agency to exert "a diligent effort" to make assignments consistent with physicians' certifications, including those of physicians other than those employed by the Agency. On the other hand, the Agency is only required to make a diligent effort to find available work consistent with the prescribed limitations and to assign it to the employee if he or she is qualified to perform the tasks. The provision does not oblige the Agency to create work for returning employees and does not require the Agency to assign work to employees who are not qualified to perform the work. If no appropriate work is available, the Agency may deny the employee's request to return to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the provision's negative impact on management's right to assign work is far outweighed by the benefits the provision confers on employees. The Agency would be required only to make efforts to identify and assign available work to qualified employees. The Agency would not be required to create work or to assign it to employees who were not qualified to perform it. Employees who are under certified medical restrictions, however, would be assured of an opportunity to be considered to perform necessary and available work for which they are qualified, and which would not aggravate their medical conditions. In this regard, enabling qualified employees to perform available work which would not impede their recovery from illness or injury provides benefits, in our view, to both the Agency and employees. We conclude, therefore, that Provision 1 does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to assign work and, therefore, constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2024 and Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 37 FLRA 249, 258 (1990), FLRA concluded that it was negotiable to require that "[e]fforts shall be made to reassign or detail the [ill or injured] employee concerned to a different duty assignment within his/her post of duty." <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 45 FLRA 339, 368 (1992) (Provision 11) (noting that management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 are "subject to" union's right to negotiate appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)).</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal required management to distribute light duty in an equitable manner. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1931 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Concord</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1044 (1988), determined that Provision 18 was similar to negotiable proposals demanding equitable distribution of work assignments, overtime, and details among qualified employees. The proposal did not require management to make light duty assignments, and the proposal did not deprive the agency of discretion in determining who would receive those assignments. The provision required only that if light duty assignments were made, that they be distributed equitably among qualified employees who are on light duty. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-114.html#sec6-115">Safety Restrictions; Risks to Safety and Health</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Light duty arrangements offered for negotiation must be tailored to their intended beneficiaries in order to be considered appropriate, as FLRA pointed out in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-23 and Defense Commissary Agency, Kelly AFB</span>, 53 FLRA 1440, 1441 (1998), involving a proposal that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If light duty is not available during the EMPLOYEE'S regular tour of duty, the EMPLOYEE will have the option of not accepting the light duty work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-23</span> proposal was nonnegotiable, 53 FLRA at 1443-44:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed sentence here applies to all temporarily disabled employees--those who "are suffering from injury or illness and have been limited to light duty by a medical official." According to the Union, the disputed sentence is intended to assist those temporarily disabled employees who have "personal reasons," such as "family commitments, transportation problems, or other valid reasons" that prevent them from working a tour other than their regularly scheduled one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not asserted or apparent that these employees are affected in different ways from any employee who is assigned to a new tour of duty.&#x2003;Moreover, the disputed sentence would allow <span class="Italic">any</span> temporarily disabled employee assigned light duty on a tour other than the employee's regular tour to decline the assignment, even if the employee does not suffer the scheduling problems the disputed sentence is intended to address. Thus, even assuming the effects identified by the Union constitute adverse effects within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the disputed sentence is not sufficiently tailored to compensate those employees suffering the effects asserted by the Union as attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See e.g., National</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Agriculture Employees and U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service</span>, <span class="Italic">Plant</span> <span class="Italic">Protection and Quarantine</span>, 51 FLRA 843, 853-54, <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, <span class="Italic">National Association of Agriculture Employees v. FLRA</span>, No. 96-1106 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 20, 1996) (finding a proposal not sufficiently tailored where not limited to employees with child care and scheduling effects alleged).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the disputed sentence is not sufficiently tailored to compensate those employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's right to assign work, it does not constitute an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In this regard, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">BATF</span> is misplaced because that case did not address the tailoring test. In any event, our conclusion that the disputed sentence is not sufficiently tailored to constitute an appropriate arrangement does not preclude the Union from reformulating the disputed sentence in a manner that is tailored and resubmitting it during appropriate negotiations.</p>
