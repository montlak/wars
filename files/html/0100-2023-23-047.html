<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-48"><span class="space">i.</span> Error or Lack of Authority of Appellant's Counsel or Union Representative--Agreement Sustained</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"An attorney retained for litigation purposes is presumed to possess express authority to enter into a settlement agreement on behalf of the client, and the client bears the burden of rebutting this presumption with affirmative proof that the attorney lacked settlement authority." <span class="Italic">Amin v. MSPB</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (discussing applicable cases). As to the claimed lack of authority of an attorney to enter a settlement, <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237, 243-44 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As a general rule an attorney may not settle his client's case without express authority to do so; however the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary.... Therefore a settlement agreement signed by the attorney will be set aside only on affirmative proof that he had no right to consent to it. [t]he party asserting the lack of such authority has a heavy burden which cannot be met by conclusory statements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wadley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 98 Fed. Appx. 843, 844 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wadley's representative entered into an oral agreement that was memorialized in the record. The representative submitted an affidavit claiming that he was authorized to enter into the settlement agreement and that Wadley revoked such authority only after the agreement had been executed. Wadley claims, however, that his representative acted without authority. "It is well established that a litigant is bound by the authorized actions of his representative." <span class="Italic">Amin v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 951 F.2d 1247, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (citations omitted). Further, a representative "retained for litigation purposes is presumed to possess express authority to enter into a settlement agreement on behalf of the client, and the client bears the burden of rebutting this presumption with affirmative proof that the attorney lacked settlement authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lambert v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-13-0368-I-1 n.2 (NP 5/15/2014) ("Similarly, to the extent that this recitation of facts implicitly raises an allegation of lack of authority to settle the case on the part of the appellant's representative, the appellant does not meet the heavy burden required to establish such lack of authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wildowsky v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 298, 301-02 (1996) (duly-authorized representative presumed to have settlement authority, and appellant who asserts that representative lacked such authority carries heavy burden that cannot be met by conclusory statements)."); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 245, 247 (1991) (last chance agreement); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Bartels v. USPS,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BARTELS_JOE_R_CH_0752_03_0698_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248619.pdf">98 MSPR 280</a>, 282-83 &#x00B6; 5 (2005) ("[t]he AJ considered evidence from the parties and found that the appellant's union representative had full authority to settle the appellant's grievance, and that there was no reason for relieving the appellant of the consequences of the agreement. The appellant has not demonstrated on review that the AJ erred in these findings or in her resultant conclusion that he failed to prove that his separation was a constructive removal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the ordinary course of events, a representative can bind the appellant to a settlement if that settlement is signed only by the representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 315 Fed. Appx. 274, 277-78 (Fed.

The settlement agreement is signed by the appellant's representative, Shane McNeill, and by an agency official, LTC John McNally, Deputy Commander for Administration.

Additionally, the appellant has presented no evidence to support his assertion that LTC McNally lacked the authority to enter into a settlement agreement on behalf of the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The lack of counsel's signature on a settlement will not likely persuade the Board that the agreement is invalid.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant has failed to provide a sufficient showing of invalidity to set aside the settlement agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, because the appellant was represented, his failure to be aware of all of the terms of the settlement prior to his receipt of the written agreement, does not provide a basis to set the agreement aside. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Laranang,</span> 40 MSPR at 236-37 (having been represented, the appellants' alleged failure to understand the full implications of a settlement agreement was insufficient to set the agreement aside). In the petition for review, the appellant indicates that, due to miscommunication with his attorney, his attorney was not aware of his demands regarding settlement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant implies that his attorney did not have authority to settle the appeal on his behalf. However, the record reflects that the appellant did not appear for the scheduled hearing in this matter. His attorney asserted that the appellant had picked up a copy of the proposed last-chance settlement agreement and opined that he may not have appeared because he thought the appeal had been settled. The attorney executed the settlement agreement for the appellant and the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as settled. Absent evidence to the contrary, a representative of record is presumed to have the authority to settle an appeal. <span class="Italic">DeLoach v.

Like the appellant in <span class="Italic">DeLoach</span>, the appellant in the instant case used the Board's designation of representative form, which specifically delegated to his representative the authority to settle the appeal on his behalf. <span class="Italic">DeLoach</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 8. Importantly, by signing the Board's designation of representative form, the appellant acknowledged his understanding "that any limitation on this settlement authority must be filed in writing with the Board." <span class="Italic">See DeLoach</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 8. The appellant did not file any written limitation on his representative's authority to settle the matter and nothing in the record, or in the circumstances presented, indicates that the appellant's attorney lacked the authority to settle the appeal. Thus, the appellant's representative had the authority to settle the appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DeLoach</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the record reflects that the appellant breached the parties' last-chance settlement agreement by not reporting for work when the agreement required him to do so.

Moreover, the appellant has not presented any evidence nor even alleged that her representative was not authorized to settle the appeal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was sufficient, according to the Board, that the appellant signed the agreement and that his chosen counsel both negotiated it and was present when the settlement was reached during a prehearing conference call. The Federal Circuit noted the appellant's participation in components of settlement negotiations in determining that a settlement was valid, <span class="Italic">Caldwell v. NSA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3332):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the second day of hearings in front of the MSPB, the attorneys for Caldwell and the NSA negotiated a settlement agreement outside of Caldwell's presence. After the terms of the agreement were settled, the agreement was read into the record. One of the terms provided that the agreement constituted a final resolution of all claims, defenses, and issues that Caldwell had raised or could have raised in connection with the agency's action against him. Following the reading of the agreement into the record, Caldwell was sworn in. He testified that he had worked on the agreement with his counsel, that he was satisfied with the terms of the agreement, and that he agreed to it in its entirety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Caldwell asserts that the settlement is invalid because he was not present in the hearing room while the agreement was being negotiated. In order to prove the settlement agreement is invalid, Caldwell bears the burden of showing that the agreement is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud practiced upon him or by a mutual mistake under which he and the NSA acted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Asberry v. USPS</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982). Although he was absent from the negotiation proceedings conducted by his counsel and the counsel for the NSA, Caldwell, himself, testified that he was fully informed of the negotiated agreement and agreed to it in its entirety. Because the fact that Caldwell was not present during the negotiation proceeding does not indicate that he was under duress or coerced into the agreement and does not sound in fraud or mutual mistake, the agreement is valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to contesting the validity of the settlement agreement, Caldwell also contends that the basic controversy surrounding the agency's action against him should be reopened. The settlement <span id="Page_4816"></span>agreement was voluntarily accepted by Caldwell and is binding on him. He has no cause of action upon which relief could be granted. The Board's dismissal of his appeal in accordance with the valid agreement was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or unlawful; procedurally deficient; or unsupported by substantial evidence, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An allegation that the attorney who signed the agreement was not appellant's attorney was insufficient to set aside a settlement in <span class="Italic">Yeto v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 402, 404 (1989). <span class="Italic">Baker v. DOJ</span>, 43 MSPR 137, 142 (1990), made it difficult for an appellant to disclaim his counsel's actions:</p>

Thus, the appellant's bare assertion that the terms of the settlement agreement were different from those he agreed to in discussions with his attorney is insufficient to set aside the agreement.... Moreover, we note that the agreement was executed on September 4, 1987, two weeks before issuance of the initial decision. Yet at no time prior to issuance of the initial decision did the appellant inform the administrative judge that he disagreed with any of the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baker</span> noted, however, that if the appellant notifies the Board that he has dismissed his attorney, the Board will not subsequently accept a settlement agreement submitted by that attorney. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 141. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Ali v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has presented no evidence to show that he was previously unaware of his attorneys' efforts to reach a settlement with the agency or that he was personally uninvolved in the negotiations leading to the agreement.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 233, 236-37 (1989), presenting what appeared to be an allegation that the attorney struck a deal for his clients without giving them the details of the deal or requesting their consent before the settlement was concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the settlement agreement consisted of only an oral agreement at the time it was communicated to the administrative judge does not detract from its validity.... While it is true that the appellants were not present when the appeals were settled, they are responsible for the actions or omissions of their designated representative.... Both appellants admit that their representative advised them that he was trying to make a "deal" or that a "deal" could be made, indicating that they were aware of some effort by their attorney to reach a settlement with the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As correctly noted by the agency in its response to the petitions, the appellants' numerous arguments and assertions of neglect and malfeasance on the part of their previous representative do not show mutual mistake or fraud. Further, having been represented, the alleged failure of the appellants to understand the full implications of a settlement agreement is insufficient to set the agreement aside. <span class="Italic">See Barker v. Department of the Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 248, 251 (1987); <span class="Italic">Bohan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 31 MSPR 601, 603 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement resolved the appeals. The announcement on the record by the appellants' designated attorney that a settlement had been reached and that the appeals were withdrawn constituted an act of finality that removed the appeals from the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Beasley v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 38 MSPR 25, 27 (1988)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Over the dissenting opinion of Chairman Erdreich, the Board refused to permit a client to overcome the presumption that his counsel acted with his authority in settling a case during a prehearing conference, even though counsel and client notified the AJ soon after the conference that the settlement was not accepted by the client and that his attorney was not authorized to enter into the settlement. <span class="Italic">Hoyos v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 532, 533-36 (1994). <span class="Italic">Ford v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 270, 273 (1994), <span class="Italic">post,</span> was distinguished because the counsel in <span class="Italic">Hoyos</span> "expressly stated during the prehearing conference that she had authority to settle the case for the appellant." The Board confused the actual and the apparent authority to settle, as the Chairman recognized in his dissent. In the Board's opinion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed to the Board from the agency's action removing him from his position of Health Technician, GS-04, effective September 3, 1993. During the prehearing conference on November 23, 1993, the parties reached an oral settlement agreement. The agreement was recorded on tape and made a part of the record pursuant to the request of the parties. Later that same day, the appellant's representative sent the administrative judge a facsimile withdrawing her consent to the agreement. The administrative judge refused to invalidate the agreement, noting that the appellant's representative stated that she had authority to enter into the settlement on the appellant's behalf, and that the appellant was bound by the actions of his designated representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant alleges that he never agreed to the terms of the agreement, attaching an affidavit from his representative attesting to his absence from the prehearing conference, and his disagreement with its terms when notified immediately afterward. The appellant also alleged that the administrative judge used coercion in settling and dismissing the case over the appellant's objection, and that he exhibited bias in favor of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an attorney may not settle her client's case without express authority to do so, the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Laranang v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 233, 235 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also Ford v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 270, 273 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, the Board remanded for a determination of a representative's settlement authority, citing the lack of any evidence that the appellant was even aware that settlement negotiations were taking place, and the appellant's denial of any prior knowledge of the settlement agreement signed by the representative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 274.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, by contrast, the appellant's attorney expressly stated during the prehearing conference that she had authority to settle the case for the appellant. The appellant's attorney further stated that the appellant understood the terms of the settlement agreement, entered into it voluntarily, and wished it to be entered into the record. Moreover, as previously stated, the appellant's representative subsequently sought to withdraw her "consent" to the agreement, revealing again her authority to act on behalf of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant's contention that "[t]he sole purpose of the prehearing conference was to identify, narrow and define issues, [and] obtain stipulations" is belied by the record. For example, the administrative judge's September 21, 1993 Order and Notice specifically stated that settlement options would be discussed at the conference, and that representatives must have authority to settle the appeal or be able to reach the person with that authority on short notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, contrary to the appellant's assertion, the Board will not give effect to a purported rescission of a settlement agreement coming after it has been filed and accepted, but before the issuance of the initial decision approving such settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Busen v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 MSPR 37, 40 (1991); <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 315, 318 (1987) (parties' representations that an oral settlement was reached was an act of finality, which had effect of removing appeal from Board's jurisdiction). In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 132, 135-36 (1988), cited by the appellant, the Board found that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal as settled when, in fact, the appellant had never agreed to the specific terms of the agreement. In the present case, by contrast, the appellant's representative expressly accepted the specific terms of the agreement, as orally read into the record by the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above, we find insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the appellant's attorney of record had authority to settle this matter on his behalf. We further find that the administrative judge's action in dismissing the appeal was not a "rush to settlement," and did not otherwise reflect coercion or bias.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From the dissenting opinion of Chairman Erdreich:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4817"></span>I respectfully dissent. I would conclude that Mr. Hoyos has met his burden of proving that his representative did not have the express authority to settle the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant that asserts that his attorney lacked the authority to settle a case carries a heavy burden. In addition, the attorney of record is presumed to have the authority to settle absent evidence to the contrary. However, the <span class="Italic">presumption of authority</span> to settle is not the same as the <span class="Italic">actual authority</span> to settle. In this case, Mr. Hoyos met his heavy burden of proving that his attorney was without the authority to settle, in spite of the presumption otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ford v. Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 270 (1994), the Board recently remanded a case for further evidence on that issue, and pointed out the need for proof of lack of authority by the appellant's attorney. Such evidence was given by Mr. Hoyos here and should be accepted by the Board as proof of lack of authority for settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The affidavit of Mr. Hoyos' attorney says she only had authority to "<span class="Italic">discuss</span> any settlement proposal," and that her practice was "never to enter[ ] into any agreements on behalf of my clients without their approval...." Mr. Hoyos by affidavit said the same, that his attorney only had "the authority to negotiate possible settlements for me. However, she has always explained them to me before a final agreement is reached."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These statements, taken together with the attorney's actions of immediately attempting (within minutes of the close of the pre-hearing conference) to notify both the administrative judge and the agency attorney of her client's rejection of the settlement provisions, prove that the attorney did not have authority to settle the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney here had only limited authority, to discuss and to negotiate possible settlement. There may have been additional representations by the attorney to the administrative judge, but the evidence before the Board taken as a whole establishes that Mr. Hoyos did not delegate to his representative the authority to settle the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general rule regarding attorney authority to settle is that an employment of counsel to represent the client does not automatically carry with it the authority to compromise or settle, and any granted authority to settle must be <span class="Italic">clear and unequivocal</span>.[3] The lack of such clear and unequivocal authority here requires the Board to set aside the purported settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;7A <span class="Italic">Corpus Juris</span> 2d 214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I would remand the appeal so that Mr. Hoyos might have a hearing on the merits of his case.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Todd v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 67, 69 (1987), the Board may have pushed its interest in settlements to an extreme, creating a settlement agreement where there may have been none:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement does not contain the signature of appellant's attorney. While the agreement contains appellant's signature, his signature was accompanied by stamped language specifically stating that it was only for the purpose of acknowledging receipt, and did not indicate his agreement with the terms of the settlement. The agreement was executed on February 27, 1987, and was signed by appellant on the same date, two weeks before the issuance of the initial decision. However, at no time prior to the issuance of the initial decision did appellant inform the administrative judge that he disagreed with any of the terms of the agreement. Moreover, the administrative judge stated in the initial decision that appellant's attorney represented to him that appellant agreed to the terms of the settlement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should the Board decline to set aside a settlement for lack of authority of counsel, it may be difficult to obtain a different result on review in the Federal Circuit. A record containing no more than a disavowal of counsel's authority is unlikely to persuade the reviewing court, <span class="Italic">Bryant v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3534):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 17, 1995, Bryant's representative entered into a second settlement agreement with the agency, pursuant to which Bryant was to receive fifteen hundred dollars and to have a "clean resignation" record. At the settlement conference (which was telephonic) Bryant's representative stated that he had discussed the proposed settlement with Bryant, that Bryant understood the proposed settlement, and that she had authorized him to accept the settlement on her behalf. After the terms of the settlement were placed on the record, the administrative judge dismissed the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bryant submitted a petition for review to the Board on February 2, 1995. In her petition for review, which she additionally titled "petition for enforcement," Bryant stated that she had not agreed to the settlement accepted by her representative. In an affidavit dated February 25, 1995, and amended March 8, 1995, she further asserted, "I did not agree to any agreement purportedly signed by [my representative] as it relates to me and my job."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find the Board's decision to be erroneous or otherwise not in accordance with law. It is a settled principle of agency law that a litigant is bound by the actions of his or her lawyer. <span class="Italic">Amin v. MSPB</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1991) "An attorney retained for litigation purposes is presumed to possess express authority to enter into a settlement agreement on behalf of the client, and the client bears the burden of rebutting this presumption with affirmative proof that the attorney lacked settlement authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Pueblo of Santo</span> <span class="Italic">Domingo v. United States</span>, 647 F.2d 1087, 1088-89 (Ct. Cl. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 456 U.S. 1006 (1982)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bryant has presented no evidence that her representative did not have authority to enter into the January 17, 1995 settlement agreement with the agency. Bryant does not contest the fact that her representative had authority to enter into the September 13 settlement agreement, and she has presented no evidence that the nature and extent of her representative's authority changed in the time between the two settlement agreements. Furthermore, she has not presented any affirmative proof that her representative was not authorized to secure a settlement in the case, or that he was not speaking truthfully when he represented to the administrative judge at the settlement conference that he had fully discussed the matter with her. While it is true that Bryant was not personally present at the time her action was settled, she is still bound by her representative's actions. <span class="Italic">Rowe v. MSPB</span>, 802 F.2d 434, 437 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Bryant's mere unsupported assertion, even if made in a sworn statement, that her representative did not have authority to act on her behalf, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that her representative possessed the authority to enter into a settlement agreement. Bryant has also failed to show that the settlement agreement was tainted with invalidity. <span class="Italic">Asberry v. USPS</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to assertions of the effect of inadequate representation on settlements, "an appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative." <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. DODDS</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 259 n.8 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. FCC</span>, DC-0752-14-0230-I-1 (NP 10/24/2014) ("Moreover, the appellant was represented by an attorney at a law firm that specializes in federal employment law, who presumably could have answered questions he may have had regarding disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Busen v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 37, 44 (1991) (finding that the appellant's own attorney's failure to advise him as to whether to agree to a settlement did not provide a basis for finding coercion by the administrative judge); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Laranang v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 233, 236-37 (1989) (where an appellant is represented, his alleged failure to understand the full implications of a settlement agreement is insufficient to set the agreement aside).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of error of counsel, the Supreme Court attributes counsel's errors to clients as one component of our representative system of litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Link v.
