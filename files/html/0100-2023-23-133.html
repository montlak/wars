<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-131"><span class="space">2.</span> Authority to Award Back Pay or Monetary Remedy</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the Board can award monetary remedies against a federal agency, there must be an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity. The Board's enforcement authority under 5 USC 1204 does not provide that waiver. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 551 F.3d 1372, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2009), explained (over the dissent of Judge Dyk) in a dispute over the availability of back pay to an employee of the FAA (under the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act of 1966):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court also notes that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204 is listed in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(H) as an exception to the bar against applying Title 5 to FAA employees. Section 1204, however, does not provide the Board authority to award back pay independent of the Back Pay Act. Section 1204(a)(2) is an "[a]ncillary" provision that endows the Board with authority to enforce its own orders in cases where it properly has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1217 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Ancillary to the board's power to adjudicate actions is the board's authority to enforce its own orders [under &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2)]."). In <span class="Italic">King</span>, this court explained that &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) provides the Board power "to enter and enforce its own orders...under the board's retained jurisdiction...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1218. This aspect of &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) is evident from its face because it grants the Board the power to "enforce compliance" with "any order or decision issued by the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984), this court provided context to the scope of enforcement power granted by &#x00A7; 1204. The Board in <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> had directed the NEA to comply with an <span id="Page_4970"></span>initial decision cancelling Kerr's termination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 733. NEA subsequently returned Kerr to his former position at the same grade and pay, but Kerr alleged that the new position was a sham and that he had been divested of his real job. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 732. The Board held that its authority over the matter of compliance ended when Kerr was restored to his former position at the same grade and pay. This court vacated, reading &#x00A7; 1204 (originally numbered 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205) as "a broad grant of enforcement power." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 733. This power included the authority to "make a substantive assessment of whether the actual duties and responsibilities to which the employee was returned are either the same as or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities held prior to the wrongful discharge." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> stands for the proposition that &#x00A7; 1204 grants the Board broad authority to enforce its own remedies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pueschel v. United States</span>, 297 F.3d 1371, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing &#x00A7; 1204 and <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> for the proposition that the Board "has authority to adjudicate the merits of petitions for enforcement alleging error by an agency in awarding back pay pursuant to an MSPB order reversing a personnel action [and granting back pay]."). Notably, <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> provides no guidance as to when the Board should grant particular remedies (such as back pay) in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does <span class="Italic">Worthington v. United States</span>, 168 F.3d 24 (Fed. Cir. 1999), stand for the proposition that &#x00A7; 1204 independently grants the Board authority to award back pay. In fact, <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> does not even cite &#x00A7; 1204. Moreover, the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> argued that "[t]he Back Pay Act [not &#x00A7; 1204] entitles him to compensation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 26. Thus, <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> had no opportunity to comment on whether &#x00A7; 1204 provides an independent avenue for awarding back pay. Regardless, one issue addressed in this case was whether the Board could hear Worthington's back pay claim when it did not have jurisdiction over his underlying claim. This court answered in the negative: "the Board has jurisdiction over claims for back pay if it has (or had) jurisdiction over the underlying claim." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27. In other words, the Board can only hear back pay claims if it has jurisdiction over the underlying claim. This statement cannot fairly be read to mean that the Board has inherent jurisdiction to award back pay <span class="Italic">whenever</span> it has jurisdiction over the underlying claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Wallace v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 283 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2002), squarely demonstrates that &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) cannot provide the Board a basis for granting back pay independent of the Back Pay Act. In <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, this court held that it could not authorize back pay interest on the petitioner's retirement benefits because "the Back Pay Act does not authorize payment of interest on back payments of retirement benefits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362. This court observed that the Board had ordered Wallace's back retirement pay restored under &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), but this court had no occasion to decide whether this underlying award had been appropriate because the only issue on appeal was whether interest on this award was forthcoming under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1364. Indeed, if &#x00A7; 1204 were a basis for back pay remedies independent of the Back Pay Act, this court could have ordered the Board to award back pay interest under &#x00A7; 1204, but it did not, mindful of this court's precedents regarding the Board's limited jurisdiction and sovereign immunity principles. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Antolin v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 895 F.2d 1395, 1396 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("The jurisdiction of the MSPB is not plenary, but is limited to those areas specifically granted by statute or regulation."); <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, 518 U.S. at 192 ("a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign."). In sum, without an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity to grant back pay awards, this court would not presume to venture to create new monetary rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1204 is not a fount of remedial authority that can provide the Board jurisdiction to grant back pay where it would otherwise lack it. Section 1204(a)(2) only ensures the Board that it may enforce orders for which it has statutory authority, and, in the case of monetary awards, an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity. In this instance, the Board has neither independent jurisdiction nor a waiver of sovereign immunity to grant back pay to FAA employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The dissenting opinion of Judge Dyk was as persuasive, but it lacked the votes, <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1381-85:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority holds that employees of the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"), alone among federal employees, may not secure back pay when appealing adverse actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"). In my view, this anomalous approach is contrary to the statute and to our prior precedent, and deprives FAA employees of a crucial remedy for improper agency action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the majority is correct in holding that the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, does not apply to FAA employees, we have previously held that the Board has the authority to award back pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204 without regard to the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. OPM</span>, 283 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The majority decision is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, and with earlier cases culminating in <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title V of the United States Code generally governs the rights of Federal government employees to challenge adverse actions taken by the employing agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 702. Section 1204 of Title V grants jurisdiction to review such actions, and the Back Pay Act separately authorizes the Board to award back pay. In 1995, Congress enacted the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 1996 (Appropriations Act of 1996), Pub. L. No. 104-50, &#x00A7; 347, 109 Stat. 436 (1995), which authorized the creation of an independent personnel management system administered by the FAA and exempted it from the vast majority of Title V, including provisions granting jurisdiction to the Board and the Back Pay Act.[1] Thus, under the Appropriations Act of 1996, FAA employees did not have the right to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 347 of the Appropriations Act of 1996 provides in relevant part:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2000, Congress enacted the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century ("Ford Act"), Pub L. No. 106-181, &#x00A7; 307(a), 114 Stat. 61 (2000), and restored the Board's jurisdiction over appeals by FAA employees. The Ford Act provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The <span class="Italic">provisions of title 5 shall not apply to the new personnel management system...with the exception of...sections 1204</span>, 1211-1218, 1221, and 7701-7703, relating to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under the new personnel management system...<span class="Italic">an employee of the Administration may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board</span> and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub L. 106-181, &#x00A7; 307(a), 114 Stat. 124-26 (emphases added); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> &#x00A7; 308, 114 Stat. 126. The new statute explicitly made &#x00A7; 1204 applicable to FAA appeals. The purpose of these provisions was to "reinstate the statutory requirement for the FAA to adhere to merit system principles and restore the right of FAA employees to submit appeals to the [Board]."[2] While the 2000 legislation explicitly referenced &#x00A7; 1204, it did not explicitly reference the Back Pay Act, and, as the majority holds, the statutory language appears to make the Back Pay Act inapplicable. Nonetheless, for years after passage of Ford Act the FAA did not contest the authority of the Board to award back pay, and the Board routinely awarded back pay in FAA cases, as it did originally in this very case. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, PH-0752-05-0262-C-1, slip op. at 1-2 (M.S.P.B., March 29, 2007); <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 392 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;S. Rep. No. 106-9, at 36 (1999) (Report of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1999, &#x00A7; 425 of which is a version of what would become &#x00A7; 308 of the Ford Act).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, on June 22, 2006, the Board <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> decided it did not have the authority to award back pay to FAA employees. <span class="Italic">Ivery v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 356 (2006). The Board reasoned that because the Back Pay Act was not specifically referenced in the exceptions listed in the Ford Act and the Appropriations Act of 1996, the Board did not have authority to award back pay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 360-61. The Board conceded that "[i]t may have been an oversight by Congress to restore Board appeal rights to FAA employees without also restoring the right of a successful appellant to be awarded back pay" but reasoned that "the doctrine of sovereign immunity will not allow the Board to assume that authority in <span id="Page_4971"></span>the absence of the required explicit waiver of that immunity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 362.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Ivery</span> sought review in this court, but the case became moot because "[appellant had] received his back pay and, at oral argument, the Government specifically stated that it was waiving any right to recoup any of the back pay that [appellant] received." 240 Fed. Appx. 413, 415 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Until today, this court has not had an opportunity to review the doctrine developed by the Board in <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with the <span class="Italic">Ivery</span> decision and the majority decision here is that the Ford Act specifically states that &#x00A7; 1204 applies to FAA employees, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(H), and this court, its predecessors, and the Supreme Court have long interpreted &#x00A7; 1204 and similar provisions to authorize the Board and its predecessors to award back pay. The Back Pay Act is simply unnecessary for this purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Commission ("CSC"), the predecessor to the Board, had the authority to award back pay long before the Back Pay Act of 1966 or predecessor legislation was passed. In <span class="Italic">Lellmann v. United States</span> our predecessor court, the Court of Claims, held that "[i]t is not necessary to cite authorities to establish the proposition that <span class="Italic">where a person is unjustly suspended</span> in the exercise of official duty, and the power having jurisdiction of him as an employee <span class="Italic">annuls such suspension, that the party is entitled to whatever emoluments there might be due him during the time of such suspension</span>." 37 Ct. Cl. 128, 135 (1902) (emphases added). The Supreme Court affirmed this doctrine in <span class="Italic">United States v. Wickersham</span>, citing <span class="Italic">Lellmann</span> with approval and holding that "[w]e see no reason...where the wrongful suspension is clearly established...for withholding from him the compensation given by law to an incumbent of the place." 201 U.S. 390, 399 (1906).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, Congress itself did not regard the Back Pay Act as necessary to the award of back pay. The Back Pay Act of 1966 was conceived as "basically perfecting legislation." H.R. Rep. No. 89-32, at 2 (1965) (report on the Back Pay Act of 1965, a prior version of the 1966 Act). Congress recognized "[m]ost adverse personnel actions where backpay is justified are already covered in some way by current authorities and <span class="Italic">the principal of backpay as a part of corrective action is well established</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). The purpose of the Back Pay Act is merely to fill "gaps in coverage," not to remove entitlement to back pay for any employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, it is clear from the legislative history of the Back Pay Act, that the Act was intended only to supplement, not to supplant, the authority to award back pay. For example, the Back Pay Act broadened the scope of the remedies available to include interest and attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">See Wallace</span>, 283 F.3d at 1364 (back pay available under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204 but interest only available under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While past decisions differ as to the authority of the CSC or the Board to award back pay under other statutes,[3] our court has consistently ruled that the Board has authority to award back pay under &#x00A7; 1204 without regard to the Back Pay Act. Section 1204 dates back to 1978, when Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA"), Pub L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, which included 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204 (originally numbered 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205). Section 1204 states in relevant part, as amended:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under this title, chapter 43 of title 38, or any other law, rule, or regulation, and, subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take final action on any such matter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection and enforce compliance with any such order;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Compare Goodwin v. United States</span>, 118 F. Supp. 369, 371 (Ct. Cl. 1954) (finding authority to award back pay under the Veterans Preference Act), <span class="Italic">with Hubbard v. MSPB</span>, 205 F.3d 1315, 1318-19 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (finding no authority to award back pay before a 1994 amendment to the Whistleblower Protection Act).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the beginning, the Board erroneously believed that, even under the broad language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204, the Board did not have the authority to order an agency to award back pay or to review any agency decision not to award back pay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Solga v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 656, 658 (1982); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 521, 523-24 (1982). But, as petitioner points out, this court reached a different conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court first corrected the error in <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 732-33 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, the Board held that, once the appellant was returned "to active duty in his former position" the Board had no jurisdiction to consider whether any further remedy was appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 732. This court disagreed, and held that "Congress expressly granted the Board special power to enforce compliance with its orders" under &#x00A7; 1204, and that the remedy should be to "place the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 732-33. We analogized the remedial powers of the Board to that of the National Labor Relations Board, and stated that "the basic purpose of a reinstatement or back pay order is restoration of the situation, as nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 733 (internal quotation omitted). The majority interprets <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> as addressing only the Board's "broad authority to enforce its own remedies" and not "when the Board should grant particular remedies (such as back pay) in the first instance." Maj. op. at 9. However, <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> plainly addresses "the MSPB's remedial powers" and includes citation to Supreme Court caselaw for the proposition that "the compensation shall be equal to the injury." 726 F.2d at 733 n.3 (citing <span class="Italic">Wicker v. Hoppock</span>, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 94, 99 (1867)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the majority's interpretation, the Board understood the language and reasoning of <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> as speaking clearly to the availability of back pay under &#x00A7; 1204. The Board viewed <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> as rejecting Board precedent that the Board lacked the authority in the first instance to award back pay. The Board overruled its prior decisions and interpreted &#x00A7; 1204 to grant the Board the authority to award back pay. <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. FAA</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 25 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro</span>, the Board analyzed the history and text of &#x00A7; 1204 at length, and discussed the authority of the predecessor CSC to award back pay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27-30. Because the CSC had authority to award back pay, <span class="Italic">before the enactment of the Back Pay Act</span>, the Board also had authority to award back pay without relying on the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27-28 (citing <span class="Italic">Goodwin</span>, 118 F. Supp. at 371). As the Board stated, "back pay is the most important element of relief next to reinstatement...[and is] necessary to effectuate the purpose of both the Board's reinstatement order and the Congressional intent that the Board's enforcement power be broad." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More recent cases have confirmed this view of &#x00A7; 1204, citing <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> and <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro</span> with approval. In <span class="Italic">Worthington v. United States</span> we cited <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro</span> for the proposition that "the Board has jurisdiction over claims for back pay if it has (or had) jurisdiction over the underlying claim." 168 F.3d 24, 27 (Fed. Cir. 1999). We held in <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> that the Board did not have jurisdiction under the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6120-6133, to award back pay because there was no adverse action over which the Board had jurisdiction. "Being forced to work a compressed work schedule does not, for example, constitute a removal, a suspension, a reduction in grade or pay, a furlough, or a reduction-in-force, as enumerated in [provisions granting the Board jurisdiction]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27. Although <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> did not directly present the question of whether back pay was authorized under &#x00A7; 1204 because there was no adverse action, the court in <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> reaffirmed the basic principle that Board jurisdiction over back pay was coextensive with Board jurisdiction over the adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, at the time that the Ford Act was passed in 2000, existing case law recognized the authority of the Board to award back pay under &#x00A7; 1204, and traditional canons of statutory construction suggest that we should interpret the Ford Act to continue that authority. <span class="Italic">See Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 580-81 (1978) ("Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and...[where] Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute."). There is, in any event, no suggestion in the history of the Ford Act that Congress intended to deny the Board the longstanding authority to award back pay, or any possible reason that Congress would wish to deny the Board the authority to award back pay in adverse action cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the enactment of the Ford Act we continued to recognize the Board's authority to award back pay under &#x00A7; 1204. In <span class="Italic">Pueschel v. United States</span>, 297 F.3d 1371, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the petitioner had received a back pay award from the Board. She brought suit in the Court of Federal Claims, asserting that the FAA had improperly refused to treat the back pay award as an award of disability benefits (with the result that supposedly improper deductions were made from the back pay award). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1372. We held that the court lacked jurisdiction because the Board had exclusive jurisdiction over back pay awards under &#x00A7; 1204. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1378. We stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">We have previously interpreted section 1204(a)</span> as constituting a broad grant of enforcement power for the MSPB to ensure that agencies restore discharged employees to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">The MSPB thus has authority to adjudicate the merits of petitions for enforcement alleging error by an agency in awarding back pay pursuant to an MSPB order reversing a personnel action.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added and citations omitted). We thus specifically recognized that the Board's authority to adjudicate back pay disputes originates under &#x00A7; 1204; we did not even mention the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Lary v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 493 F.3d 1355, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("On its face, [&#x00A7; 1204(a)(2)] does not limit the Board's authority to any particular means of enforcing compliance with its orders or prevent it from ordering specific performance."). The clear logic of these cases culminated in <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, which in my view is inconsistent with the majority's decision here. 283 F.3d at 1364.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4972"></span>In <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, a retired employee had been awarded back pay by the Board, but he claimed that he was entitled to interest on the back pay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1360. We first concluded that the Back Pay Act did not cover the appellant because "as a retired employee, [appellant is] not an 'employee' covered by the [Back Pay] Act." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362. We held that the Board was only authorized to award the appellant back retirement pay "pursuant to the Board's enforcement authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2)," and that no interest could be awarded since the Back Pay Act was inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1364. Thus, the predicate for our holding was that &#x00A7; 1204 authorized the award of back pay, a predicate inconsistent with the majority's decision here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in my view, the Board has authority to award back pay to FAA employees pursuant to &#x00A7; 1204. In restoring the authority of the Board to award relief under &#x00A7; 1204, Congress plainly contemplated that all the available remedies under &#x00A7; 1204, including back pay, would be available. Because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204 grants the Board the authority to award back pay to FAA employees, I would reverse the decision of the Board and remand with instructions that the Board appropriately enforce its order awarding back pay to Gonzalez. I respectfully dissent from the majority's decision to affirm the Board, and to hold that back pay cannot be awarded under &#x00A7; 1204.</p>
