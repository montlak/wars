<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-209"><span class="space">E.</span> CRITICAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Is service efficiency enhanced through the removal of critics of the government and its sensitive managers? The answer is that it depends. Criticism may reach the level of insubordination or it may undermine public confidence in government operations. Critical speech may expose wrongdoing and advance the public interest and democratic values. Court decisions diverge in their analyses: some require particularized showings of harm to the government to sustain discipline of critics; others do not. The product is doctrinal confusion, disparity in results. [Decisions here should be read with both the discussion concerning "<a href="0100-2023-13-045.html#sec6-46">Whistleblowing Reprisal</a>" in Chapter 13 and the discussion earlier in this chapter concerning both "<a href="0100-2023-15-129.html#sec8-128">Insubordination and Similar Misconduct</a>" and employee "<a href="0100-2023-15-147.html#sec8-146">Grievance Proceeding</a>" during the presentation of grievances; refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-162.html#sec8-161">Federal Labor Law Policy; Collective Bargaining Contract</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before delving into the plethora of Board and circuit court cases defining the limits on the free speech of federal employees, we examine several decisions of the Supreme Court. We are examining the basic decision and the reasoning of the Court--not the dissenting and concurring opinions that portray the full scope of the controversy before the Court. <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Educ.</span>, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), establishes the factors relevant to the constitutionality of discipline against public employees who make public statements critical of the government. <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138 (1983), extends the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis to government employees' expressions of job dissatisfaction about matters principally of private concern within their organizations. <span class="Italic">City of San Diego, Cal. v. Roe</span>, 125 S. Ct. 521 (2004), negates the need for a balancing test when a government employer terminates an employee for private speech, having no public interest connotations, that is perceived as injurious to the government's interests. <span class="Italic">Rankin v. McPherson</span>, 483 U.S. 378 (1987), applies that balancing test to government employees' private expressions within the government about matters of public concern. <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), provides an analytical tool to determine the causal relationship of constitutionally protected speech and dismissal of a government employee. <span class="Italic">Garcetti v. Ceballos,</span> 126 S. Ct. 1951 (2006), exempts from First Amendment protection statements made pursuant to an employee's official duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Our analysis begins with <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Educ.</span>, 391 U.S. 563, 568-74 (1968). Pickering, a public school teacher, was dismissed for sending a letter to the local newspaper, concerning a proposed tax increase, critical of how the Board of Education and the district superintendent handled past proposals to raise new school revenue. Publication of the letter arguably was detrimental to the efficient operation and administration of the schools. A subsequent administrative hearing resulted in a determination that some statements in the employee's letter, published by the newspaper, were false. No evidence was introduced concerning the effect of the publication of the letter on the administration of the school system, and there were no findings on that point by the administrative tribunal or the state courts that reviewed the case before it reached the Supreme Court. Reversing and remanding the state court decision upholding the discharge, and directing reconsideration of that dismissal, the Court declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the Illinois Supreme Court's opinion may be read to suggest that teachers may constitutionally be compelled to relinquish the First Amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operation of the public schools in which they work, it proceeds on a premise that has been unequivocally rejected in numerous prior decisions of this Court....&#8197;"[T]he theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected."...&#8197;At the same time it cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because of the enormous variety of fact situations in which critical statements by teachers and other public employees may be thought by their superiors, against whom the statements are directed, to furnish grounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appropriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general standard against which all such statements may be judged. However, in the course of evaluating the conflicting claims of First Amendment protection and the need for orderly school administration in the context of this case, we shall indicate some of the general lines along which an analysis of the controlling interests should run.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An examination of the statements in appellant's letter objected to by the Board reveals that they, like the letter as a whole, consist essentially of criticism of the Board's allocation of school funds between educational and athletic programs, and of both the Board's and the superintendent's methods of informing, or preventing the informing of, the district's taxpayers of the real reasons why additional tax revenues were being sought for the schools. The statements are in no way directed towards any person with whom appellant would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work as a teacher. Thus no question of maintaining either discipline by immediate superiors or harmony among coworkers is presented here. Appellant's employment relationships with the Board and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with the superintendent are not the kind of close working relationships for which it can persuasively be claimed that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning. Accordingly, to the extent the Board's position here can be taken to suggest that even comments on matters of public concern that are substantially correct...may furnish grounds for dismissal if they are sufficiently critical in tone, we unequivocally reject it.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;It is possible to conceive of some positions in public employment in which the need for confidentiality is so great that even completely correct public statements might furnish a permissible ground for dismissal. Likewise, positions in public employment in which the relationship between superior and subordinate is of such a personal and intimate nature that certain forms of public criticism of the superior by the subordinate would seriously undermine the effectiveness of the working relationship between them can also be imagined. We intimate no views as to how we would resolve any specific instances of such situations, but merely note that significantly different considerations would be involved in such cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider the statements in appellant's letter which we agree to be false. The Board's original charges included allegations that the publication of the letter damaged the professional reputations of the Board and the superintendent and would foment controversy and conflict among the Board, teachers, administrators, and the residents of the district. However, no evidence to support these allegations was introduced at the hearing. So far as the record reveals, Pickering's letter was greeted by everyone but its main target, the Board, with massive apathy and total disbelief. The Board must, therefore, have decided, perhaps by analogy with the law of libel, that the statements were <span class="Italic">per se</span> harmful to the operation of the schools.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the only way in which the Board could conclude, absent any evidence of the actual effect of the letter, that the statements contained therein were <span class="Italic">per se</span> detrimental to the interest of the schools was to equate the Board members' own interests with that of the schools. Certainly an accusation that too much money is being spent on athletics by the administrators of the school system...cannot reasonably be regarded as <span class="Italic">per se</span> detrimental to the district's schools. Such an accusation reflects rather a difference of opinion between Pickering and the Board as to the preferable manner of operating the school system, a difference of opinion that clearly concerns an issue of general public interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the fact that particular illustrations of the Board's claimed undesirable emphasis on athletic programs are false would not normally have any necessary impact on the actual operations of the schools, beyond its tendency to anger the Board. For example, Pickering's letter was written after the defeat at the polls of the second proposed tax increase. It could, therefore, have had no effect on the ability of the school district to raise necessary revenue, since there was no showing that there was any proposal to increase taxes pending when the letter was written.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, the question whether a school system requires additional funds is a matter of legitimate public concern on which the judgment of the school administration, including the School Board, cannot, in a society that leaves such questions to popular vote, be taken as conclusive. On such a question free and open debate is vital to informed decision-making by the electorate. Teachers are, as a class, the members of the community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the amounts expended on athletics which Pickering reported erroneously were matters of public record on which his position as a teacher in the district did not qualify him to speak with any greater authority than any other taxpayer. The Board could easily have rebutted appellant's errors by publishing the accurate figures itself, either via a letter to the same newspaper or otherwise. We are thus not presented with a situation in which a teacher has carelessly made false statements about matters so closely related to the day-to-day operations of the schools that any harmful impact on the public would be difficult to counter because of the teacher's presumed greater access to the real facts. Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider at this time whether <span id="Page_2721"></span>under such circumstances a school board could reasonably require that a teacher make substantial efforts to verify the accuracy of his charges before publishing them.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;There is likewise no occasion furnished by this case for consideration of the extent to which teachers can be required by narrowly drawn grievance procedures to submit complaints about the operation of the schools to their superiors for action thereon prior to bringing the complaints before the public.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What we do have before us is a case in which a teacher has made erroneous public statements upon issues then currently the subject of public attention, which are critical of his ultimate employer but which are neither shown nor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded the teacher's proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom[5] or to have interfered with the regular operation of the schools generally. In these circumstances we conclude that the interest of the school administration in limiting teachers' opportunities to contribute to public debate is not significantly greater than its interest in limiting a similar contribution by any member of the general public.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We also note that this case does not present a situation in which a teacher's public statements are so without foundation as to call into question his fitness to perform his duties in the classroom. In such a case, of course, the statements would merely be evidence of the teacher's general competence, or lack thereof, and not an independent basis for dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The public interest in having free and unhindered debate on matters of public importance--the core value of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment--is so great that it has been held that a State cannot authorize the recovery of damages by a public official for defamatory statements directed at him except when such statements are shown to have been made either with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. <span class="Italic">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</span>, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)....&#8197;The same test has been applied to suits for invasion of privacy based on false statements where a "matter of public interest" is involved....&#8197;It is therefore perfectly clear that, were appellant a member of the general public, the State's power to afford the appellee Board of Education or its members any legal right to sue him for writing the letter at issue here would be limited by the requirement that the letter be judged by the standard laid down in <span class="Italic">New York Times</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Court has also indicated, in more general terms, that statements by public officials on matters of public concern must be accorded First Amendment protections despite the fact that the statements are directed at their nominal superiors....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is apparent that the threat of dismissal from public employment is...a potent means of inhibiting speech. We have already noted our disinclination to make an across-the-board equation of dismissal from public employment for remarks critical of superiors with awarding damages in a libel suit by a public official for similar criticism. However, in a case such as the present one, in which the fact of employment is only tangentially and unsubstantially involved in the subject matter of the public communication made by a teacher, we conclude that it is necessary to regard the teacher as the member of the general public he seeks to be.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we hold that, in a case such as this, absent proof of false statements knowingly or recklessly made by him,[6] a teacher's exercise of his right to speak on issues of public importance may not furnish the basis for his dismissal from public employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Because we conclude that appellant's statements were not knowingly or recklessly false, we have no occasion to pass upon the additional question whether a statement that was knowingly or recklessly false would, if it were neither shown nor could reasonably be presumed to have had any harmful effects, still be protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The next Supreme Court decision defining and refining the free speech protections of public employees is <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 1087-94 (1983). Ms. Myers was a New Orleans assistant district attorney responsible for trying criminal cases. She became concerned about her proposed transfer to a different section of the criminal court, a transfer she opposed for professional reasons. She prepared a questionnaire soliciting the views of her fellow staff members about office transfer policy, the need for a grievance committee, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns. After she began distribution of the questionnaire, a supervisor who learned of it told the district attorney that Myers was creating a "mini-insurrection" within the office. The DA returned to the office and told Myers that she was terminated for refusing to accept the transfer. She also was told distribution of the questionnaire was insubordination. The DA particularly objected to a question inquiring whether employees had confidence in and would rely on the word of various office supervisors, and to a question concerning pressure to work in political campaigns, information the DA felt would be damaging if discovered by the press. Reversing a judgment in favor of Myers, the Court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District Court, and thus the Court of Appeals as well, misapplied our decision in <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> and consequently, in our view, erred in striking the balance for respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Connick contends at the outset that no balancing of interests is required in this case because Myers' questionnaire concerned only internal office matters and that such speech is not a matter of "public concern," as the term was used in <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>. Although we do not agree that Myers' communication in this case was wholly without First Amendment protection, there is much force to Connick's submission. The repeated emphasis in <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> on the right of a public employee "as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern," was not accidental. This language, reiterated in all of <span class="Italic">Pickering's</span> progeny, reflects both the historical evolvement of the rights of public employees, and the common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In all of...the precedents in which <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> is rooted, the invalidated statutes and actions sought to suppress the rights of public employees to participate in public affairs. The issue was whether government employees could be prevented or "chilled" by the fear of discharge from joining political parties and other associations that certain public officials might find "subversive." The explanation for the Constitution's special concern with threats to the right of citizens to participate in political affairs is no mystery. The First Amendment "was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people."..."Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government."...&#8197;Accordingly, the Court has frequently reaffirmed that speech on public issues occupies the "highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values," and is entitled to special protection....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, its antecedents, and its progeny lead us to conclude that if Myers' questionnaire cannot be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern, it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her discharge. When employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment. Perhaps the government employer's dismissal of the worker may not be fair, but ordinary dismissals from government service which violate no fixed tenure or applicable statute or regulation are not subject to judicial review even if the reasons for the dismissal are alleged to be mistaken or unreasonable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not suggest, however, that Myers' speech, even if not touching upon a matter of public concern, is totally beyond the protection of the First Amendment....&#8197;We hold only that when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee's behavior....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record. In this case, with but one exception, the questions posed by Myers to her co-workers do not fall under the rubric of matters of "public concern." We view the questions pertaining to the confidence and trust that Myers' co-workers possess in various supervisors, the level of office morale, and the need for a grievance committee as mere extensions of Myers' dispute over her transfer to another section of the criminal court....&#8197;Myers did not seek to inform the public that the District Attorney's Office was not discharging its governmental responsibilities in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases. Nor did Myers seek to bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust on the part of Connick and others. Instead, the questionnaire, if related to the public, would convey no information at all other than the fact that a single employee is upset with the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. While discipline and morale in the workplace are related to an agency's efficient performance of its duties, the focus of Myers' questions is not to evaluate the performance of the office but rather to gather ammunition for another round of controversy with her superiors. These questions reflect one employee's dissatisfaction with a transfer and an attempt to turn that displeasure into a cause c&#x00E8;l&#x00E8;bre.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To presume that all matters which transpire within a government office are of public concern would mean that virtually every remark--and certainly every criticism directed at a public official--would plant the seed of a constitutional case. While as a matter of good judgment, public officials should be receptive to constructive criticism offered by their employees, the First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One question in Myers' questionnaire, however, does touch upon <span id="Page_2722"></span>a matter of public concern. Question 11 inquires if assistant district attorneys "ever feel pressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of office supported candidates."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balance requires full consideration of the government's interest in the effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities to the public....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Connick's judgment...was that Myers' questionnaire was an act of insubordination which interfered with working relationships. When close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities, a wide degree of deference to the employer's judgment is appropriate. Furthermore, we do not see the necessity for an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking action. We caution that a stronger showing may be necessary if the employee's speech more substantially involved matters of public concern.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also relevant is the manner, time, and place in which the questionnaire was distributed....&#8197;Here the questionnaire was prepared and distributed at the office; the manner of distribution required not only Myers to leave her work but others to do the same in order that the questionnaire be completed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the context in which the dispute arose is also significant. This is not a case where an employee, out of purely academic interest, circulated a questionnaire so as to obtain useful research....&#8197;When employee speech concerning office policy arises from an employment dispute concerning the very application of that policy to the speaker, additional weight must be given to the supervisor's view that the employee has threatened the authority of the employer to run the office....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Myers' questionnaire touched upon matters of public concern in only a most limited sense; her survey, in our view, is most accurately characterized as an employee grievance concerning internal office policy. The limited First Amendment interest involved here does not require that Connick tolerate action which he reasonably believed would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and destroy close working relationships....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although today the balance is struck for the government, this is no defeat for the First Amendment. For it would indeed be a Pyrrhic victory for the great principles of free expression if the Amendment's safeguarding of a public employee's right, as a citizen, to participate in discussions concerning public affairs were confused with the attempt to constitutionalize the employee grievance that we see presented here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following up on <span class="Italic">Connick</span> was <span class="Italic">City of San Diego, Cal. v. Roe</span>, 125 S. Ct. 521, 522-26 (2004), involving a police officer fired for off-duty conduct perceived as detrimental to the police department but that had no public interest component, and, as a result, did not require a <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The city of San Diego (City), a petitioner here, terminated a police officer, respondent, for selling videotapes he made and for related activity. The tapes showed the respondent engaging in sexually explicit acts. Respondent brought suit alleging, among other things, that the termination violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to freedom of speech....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A government employee does not relinquish all First Amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y.</span>, 385 U.S. 589, 605-606 (1967). On the other hand, a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees, restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public. The Court has recognized the right of employees to speak on matters of public concern, typically matters concerning government policies that are of interest to the public at large, a subject on which public employees are uniquely qualified to comment. <span class="Italic">See Connick</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205</span>,<span class="Italic"> Will Cty</span>., 391 U.S. 563 (1968). Outside of this category, the Court has held that when government employees speak or write on their own time on topics unrelated to their employment, the speech can have First Amendment protection, absent some governmental justification "far stronger than mere speculation" in regulating it. <span class="Italic">United States v. Treasury Employees</span>, 513 U.S. 454, 465, 475 (1995) (NTEU). We have little difficulty in concluding that the City was not barred from terminating Roe under either line of cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In concluding that Roe's activities qualified as a matter of public concern, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>. 356 F. 3d, at 1117. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> it was established that the speech was unrelated to the employment and had no effect on the mission and purpose of the employer. The question was whether the Federal Government could impose certain monetary limitations on outside earnings from speaking or writing on a class of federal employees. The Court held that, within the particular classification of employment, the Government had shown no justification for the outside salary limitations. The First Amendment right of the employees sufficed to invalidate the restrictions on the outside earnings for such activities. The Court noted that throughout history public employees who undertook to write or to speak in their spare time had made substantial contributions to literature and art, <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 465, and observed that none of the speech at issue "even arguably [had] any adverse impact" on the employer. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals' reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> was seriously misplaced. Although Roe's activities took place outside the workplace and purported to be about subjects not related to his employment, the SDPD demonstrated legitimate and substantial interests of its own that were compromised by his speech. Far from confining his activities to speech unrelated to his employment, Roe took deliberate steps to link his videos and other wares to his police work, all in a way injurious to his employer. The use of the uniform, the law enforcement reference in the Web site, the listing of the speaker as "in the field of law enforcement," and the debased parody of an officer performing indecent acts while in the course of official duties brought the mission of the employer and the professionalism of its officers into serious disrepute. 356 F. 3d, at 1111 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals noted the City conceded Roe's activities were "unrelated" to his employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1112, n.4. In the context of the pleadings and arguments, the proper interpretation of the City's statement is simply to underscore the obvious proposition that Roe's speech was not a comment on the workings or functioning of the SDPD. It is quite a different question whether the speech was detrimental to the SDPD. On that score the City's consistent position has been that the speech is contrary to its regulations and harmful to the proper functioning of the police force. The present case falls outsidethe police force. The present case falls outside the protection afforded in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>. The authorities that instead control, and which are considered below, are this Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and the decisions which follow them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To reconcile the employee's right to engage in speech and the government employer's right to protect its own legitimate interests in performing its mission, the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> Court adopted a balancing test. It requires a court evaluating restraints on a public employee's speech to balance "the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." 391 U.S., at 568; <span class="Italic">see also Connick</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 142. Underlying the decision in <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> is the recognition that public employees are often the members of the community who are likely to have informed opinions as to the operations of their public employers, operations which are of substantial concern to the public. Were they not able to speak on these matters, the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> 391 U.S., at 572. The interest at stake is as much the public's interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee's own right to disseminate it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pickering</span> did not hold that any and all statements by a public employee are entitled to balancing. To require <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing in every case where speech by a public employee is at issue, no matter the content of the speech, could compromise the proper functioning of government offices. <span class="Italic">See Connick</span>, 461 U.S., at 143. This concern prompted the Court in Connick to explain a threshold inquiry (implicit in <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> itself) that in order to merit <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing, a public employee's speech must touch on a matter of "public concern." 461 U.S., at 143 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, an assistant district attorney, unhappy with her supervisor's decision to transfer her to another division, circulated an intraoffice questionnaire. The document solicited her co-workers' views on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, office transfer policy, office morale, the need for grievance committees, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, at 141.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finding that--with the exception of the final question--the questionnaire touched not on matters of public concern but on internal workplace grievances, the Court held no <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing was required. 461 U.S., at 141. To conclude otherwise would ignore the "common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 143. <span class="Italic">Connick</span> held that a public employee's speech is entitled to <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing only when the employee speaks "as a citizen upon matters of public concern" rather than "as an employee upon matters only of personal interest." 461 U.S., at 147.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the boundaries of the public concern test are not well-defined, <span class="Italic">Connick</span> provides some guidance. It directs courts to examine the "content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record" in assessing whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 146-147. In addition, it notes that the standard for determining whether expression is of public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common-law action for invasion of privacy is present. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 143, n.5. That standard is established <span id="Page_2723"></span>by our decisions in <span class="Italic">Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn</span>, 420 U.S. 469 (1975), and <span class="Italic">Time, Inc</span>.<span class="Italic"> v. Hill</span>, 385 U.S. 374, 387-388 (1967). These cases make clear that public concern is something that is a subject of legitimate news interest; that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication. The Court has also recognized that certain private remarks, such as negative comments about the President of the United States, touch on matters of public concern and should thus be subject to <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing. <span class="Italic">See Rankin v. McPherson</span>, 483 U.S. 378 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles to the instant case, there is no difficulty in concluding that Roe's expression does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any view of the public concern test. He fails the threshold test and <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing does not come into play.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Connick</span> is controlling precedent, but to show why this is not a close case it is instructive to note that even under the view expressed by the dissent in <span class="Italic">Connick</span> from four Members of the Court, the speech here would not come within the definition of a matter of public concern. The dissent in <span class="Italic">Connick</span> would have held that the entirety of the questionnaire circulated by the employee "discussed subjects that could reasonably be expected to be of interest to persons seeking to develop informed opinions about the manner in which...an elected official charged with managing a vital governmental agency, discharges his responsibilities." 461 U.S., at 163 (opinion of Brennan, J.). No similar purpose could be attributed to the employee's speech in the present case. Roe's activities did nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the SDPD's functioning or operation. Nor were Roe's activities anything like the private remarks at issue in Rankin, where one coworker commented to another co-worker on an item of political news. Roe's expression was widely broadcast, linked to his official status as a police officer, and designed to exploit his employer's image.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The speech in question was detrimental to the mission and functions of the employer. There is no basis for finding that it was of concern to the community as the Court's cases have understood that term in the context of restrictions by governmental entities on the speech of their employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The third in the series of principal Supreme Court pronouncements on the First Amendment rights of public employees is <span class="Italic">Rankin v. McPherson</span>, 483 U.S. 378, 383-84, 386-92 (1987). The duties of Ms. McPherson, a deputy in the office of the constable of Harris County, Texas, involved no substantial public contact. McPherson learned in March 1981 of an attempt to assassinate the President of the United States. During her conversation with a coworker, McPherson said, as to the President's cutbacks of Medicaid and food stamps, that if "they go for him again, I hope they get him." The remark was overheard by another employee, who reported it to the Constable. The Constable questioned McPherson about the statement. McPherson admitted it and said she did not mean anything by it. The Constable then fired McPherson. The Court concluded that the dismissal was improper:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though McPherson was merely a probationary employee, and even if she could have been discharged for any reason or for no reason at all, she may nonetheless be entitled to reinstatement if she was discharged for exercising her constitutional right to freedom of expression....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination whether a public employer has properly discharged an employee for engaging in speech requires "a balance between the interests of the employee, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."...&#8197;Vigilance is necessary to ensure that public employers do not use authority over employees to silence discourse, not because it hampers public functions but simply because superiors disagree with the content of employees' speech.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the statement in context, as <span class="Italic">Connick</span> requires, discloses that it plainly dealt with a matter of public concern. The statement was made in the course of a conversation addressing the policies of the President's administration. It came on the heels of a news bulletin regarding what is certainly a matter of heightened public attention: an attempt on the life of the President. While a statement that amounted to a threat to kill the President would not be protected by the First Amendment, the District Court concluded, and we agree, that McPherson's statement did not amount to a threat, punishable...or...that could properly be criminalized at all....&#8197;The inappropriate or controversial character of a statement is irrelevant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern. "Debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and...may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."...&#8197;"Just as erroneous statements must be protected to give freedom of expression the breathing space it needs to service, so statements criticizing public policy and the implementation of it must be similarly protected."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because McPherson's statement addressed a matter of public concern, <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> next requires that we balance McPherson's interest in making her statement against "the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."...&#8197;The State bears a burden of justifying the discharge on legitimate grounds. <span class="Italic">Connick</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In performing the balancing, the statement will not be considered in a vacuum; the manner, time, and place of the employee's expression are relevant, as is the context in which the dispute arose....&#8197;We have previously recognized as pertinent considerations whether the statement impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among co-workers, has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary, or impedes the performance of the speaker's duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These considerations, and indeed the very nature of the balancing test, make apparent that the state interest element of the test focuses on the effective functioning of that public employer's enterprise. Interference with work, personnel relationships, or the speaker's job performance can detract from the public employee's function; avoiding such interference can be a strong state interest. From this perspective, however, petitioner fails to demonstrate a state interest that outweighs McPherson's First Amendment rights. While McPherson's statement was made at the workplace, there is no evidence that it interfered with the efficient functioning of the office. The Constable was evidently not afraid that McPherson had disturbed or interrupted other employees--he did not inquire to whom respondent had made the remark and testified that he "was not concerned who she had made it to."...&#8197;In fact, Constable Rankin testified that the possibility of interference with the functions of the Constable's office had <span class="Italic">not</span> been a consideration in his discharge of respondent and that he did not even inquire whether the remark had disrupted the work of the office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor was there any danger that McPherson had discredited the office by making her statement in public. McPherson's speech took place in an area to which there was ordinarily no public access; her remark was evidently made in a private conversation with another employee. There is no suggestion that any member of the general public was present or heard McPherson's statement. Nor is there any evidence that employees other than Jackson who worked in the room even heard the remark. Not only was McPherson's discharge unrelated to the functioning of the office, it was not based on any assessment by the Constable that the remark demonstrated a character trait that made respondent unfit to perform her work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The burden of caution employees bear with respect to the words they speak will vary with the extent of authority and public accountability the employee's role entails. Where, as here, an employee serves no confidential, policymaking, or public contact role, the danger to the agency's successful function from the employee's private speech is minimal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...McPherson's employment-related interaction with the Constable was apparently negligible. Her duties were purely clerical and were limited solely to the civil process function of the Constable's office. There is no indication that she would ever be in a position to further--or indeed to have any involvement with--the minimal law enforcement activity engaged in by the constable's office. Given the function of the agency, McPherson's position in the office, and the nature of her statement, we are not persuaded that Rankin's interest in discharging her outweighed her rights under the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision defined the means to measure the causal relation between constitutionally protected conduct and dismissal of a public employee. <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 283, 285-87 (1977), involved a teacher who alleged that the refusal of a school board to renew his contract violated his constitutional rights. He complained that the real reason for nonrenewal was his association with activities on behalf of a teachers' organization. Evidence showed that Mr. Doyle became involved in arguments with other teachers and employees of the school and that he made some disparaging remarks and gestures to some students. A bond issue underwrote the controversy. The school principal circulated to teachers a memo concerning teacher dress and appearance, prompted by the view of some in the administration that there was a relation between teacher appearance and public support for bond issues. Although Mr. Doyle was aware that differences over the memo concerning teacher appearance were to be settled by joint administration-teacher action, he called a radio station and read the substance of the memo to a disc jockey, who promptly announced the dress code as a news item on the air. Doyle subsequently apologized to the principal, conceding that he should have made some prior communication of his criticism to the school administration. A month later the school superintendent made various recommendations concerning contract renewal of teachers. His recommendation, accepted by the Board, was not to rehire Doyle. It stated that the reason for the nonrenewal was that Doyle displayed a "notable lack of tact in handling professional matters which leaves much doubt as to [his] sincerity in establishing good school relationships" and referred to the radio station incident and to an incident involving an obscene <span id="Page_2724"></span>gesture to a student. The Court, revisiting the constitutional protections inherent in First Amendment communications and providing some guidance concerning motivational analysis concerning alleged constitutional violations arising from employment relationships, resolved that if a motivating factor in the personnel action is constitutionally protected conduct, the employer must then have the opportunity to demonstrate by a "preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent's reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Doyle's claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments are not defeated by the fact that he did not have tenure. Even though he could have been discharged for no reason whatever, and had no constitutional right to a hearing prior to the decision not to rehire him...he may nonetheless establish a claim to reinstatement if the decision not to rehire him was made by reason of his exercise of constitutionally protected First Amendment freedoms....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since respondent Doyle had no tenure, and there was therefore not even a state-law requirement of "cause" or "reason" before a decision could be made not to renew his employment...the Board legally <span class="Italic">could</span> have dismissed respondent had the radio station incident never come to its attention....&#8197;We are thus brought to the issue whether, even if that were the case, the fact that the protected conduct played a "substantial part" in the actual decision not to renew would necessarily amount to a constitutional violation justifying remedial action. We think that it would not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A rule of causation which focuses solely on whether protected conduct played a part, "substantial" or otherwise, in a decision not to rehire, could place an employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing. The difficulty with the rule enunciated by the District Court is that it would require reinstatement in cases where a dramatic and perhaps abrasive incident is inevitably on the minds of those responsible for the decision to rehire, and does indeed play a part in that decision--even if the same decision would have been reached had the incident not occurred. The constitutional principle at stake is sufficiently vindicated if such an employee is placed in no worse a position than if he had not engaged in the conduct. A borderline or marginal candidate should not have the employment question resolved against him because of constitutionally protected conduct. But that same candidate ought not to be able, by engaging in such conduct, to prevent his employer from assessing his performance record and reaching a decision not to rehire on the basis of that record, simply because the protected conduct makes the employer more certain of the correctness of its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is especially true where, as...here, the current decision to rehire will accord "tenure." The long-term consequences of an award of tenure are of great moment both to the employee and to the employer. They are too significant for us to hold that the Board in this case would be precluded, because it considered constitutionally protected conduct in deciding not to rehire Doyle, from attempting to prove to a trier of fact that quite apart from such conduct Doyle's record was such that he would not have been rehired in any event.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, in this case, the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected, and that his conduct was a "substantial factor"--or, to put it in other words, that it was a "motivating factor" in the Board's decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent's reemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a ruling important to federal employees, in 2006 the Supreme Court decided that "when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline." The case arose when a deputy district attorney, Ceballos, complained of reprisals in his work assignments and nonpromotion after he informed his supervisors, as well as a judge before whom Cabellos testified in the preliminary stages of a criminal case, about inconsistencies and misrepresentations contained in affidavit evidence pertaining to a search warrant involved in a case that was under investigation. Under <span class="Italic">Garcetti v. Ceballos,</span> 126 S. Ct. 1951 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that "a State cannot condition public employment on a basis that infringes the employee's constitutionally protected interest in freedom of expression." <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers,</span> 461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983). The question presented by the instant case is whether the First Amendment protects a government employee from discipline based on speech made pursuant to the employee's official duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Court's decisions have noted, for many years "the unchallenged dogma was that a public employee had no right to object to conditions placed upon the terms of employment--including those which restricted the exercise of constitutional rights." <span class="Italic">Connick,</span> 461 U.S., at 143. That dogma has been qualified in important respects. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> at 144-145. The Court has made clear that public employees do not surrender all their First Amendment rights by reason of their employment. Rather, the First Amendment protects a public employee's right, in certain circumstances, to speak as a citizen addressing matters of public concern. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pickering, supra,</span> at 568; <span class="Italic">Connick, supra,</span> at 147; <span class="Italic">Rankin v. McPherson,</span> 483 U.S. 378, 384 (1987); <span class="Italic">United States v. Treasury Employees,</span> 513 U.S. 454, 466 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pickering</span> provides a useful starting point in explaining the Court's doctrine. There the relevant speech was a teacher's letter to a local newspaper addressing issues including the funding policies of his school board. 391 U.S., at 566. "The problem in any case," the Court stated, "is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 568. The Court found the teacher's speech "neither [was] shown nor can be presumed to have in any way either impeded the teacher's proper performance of his daily duties in the classroom or to have interfered with the regular operation of the schools generally." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 572-573 (footnote omitted). Thus, the Court concluded that "the interest of the school administration in limiting teachers' opportunities to contribute to public debate is not significantly greater than its interest in limiting a similar contribution by any member of the general public." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 573.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pickering</span> and the cases decided in its wake identify two inquiries to guide interpretation of the constitutional protections accorded to public employee speech. The first requires determining whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> at 568. If the answer is no, the employee has no First Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer's reaction to the speech. <span class="Italic">See Connick, supra,</span> at 147. If the answer is yes, then the possibility of a First Amendment claim arises. The question becomes whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public. <span class="Italic">See Pickering,</span> 391 U.S., at 568. This consideration reflects the importance of the relationship between the speaker's expressions and employment. A government entity has broader discretion to restrict speech when it acts in its role as employer, but the restrictions it imposes must be directed at speech that has some potential to affect the entity's operations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, conducting these inquiries sometimes has proved difficult. This is the necessary product of "the enormous variety of fact situations in which critical statements by teachers and other public employees may be thought by their superiors...to furnish grounds for dismissal." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 569. The Court's overarching objectives, though, are evident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a citizen enters government service, the citizen by necessity must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Waters v. Churchill,</span> 511 U.S. 661, 671 (1994) (plurality opinion) ("[T]he government as employer indeed has far broader powers than does the government as sovereign"). Government employers, like private employers, need a significant degree of control over their employees' words and actions; without it, there would be little chance for the efficient provision of public services. <span class="Italic">Cf. Connick, supra,</span> at 143 ("[G]overnment offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter"). Public employees, moreover, often occupy trusted positions in society. When they speak out, they can express views that contravene governmental policies or impair the proper performance of governmental functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time, the Court has recognized that a citizen who works for the government is nonetheless a citizen. The First Amendment limits the ability of a public employer to leverage the employment relationship to restrict, incidentally or intentionally, the liberties employees enjoy in their capacities as private citizens. <span class="Italic">See Perry v. Sindermann,</span> 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). So long as employees are speaking as citizens about matters of public concern, they must face only those speech restrictions that are necessary for their employers to operate efficiently and effectively. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Connick, supra,</span> at 147 ("Our responsibility is to ensure that citizens are not deprived of fundamental rights by virtue of working for the government").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court's employee-speech jurisprudence protects, of course, the constitutional rights of public employees. Yet the First Amendment interests at stake extend beyond the individual speaker. The Court has acknowledged the importance of promoting the public's interest in receiving the well-informed views of government employees engaging in civic discussion. <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> again provides an instructive example. The Court characterized its holding as rejecting the attempt of school administrators to "limi[t] teachers' opportunities to contribute to public <span id="Page_2725"></span>debate." 391 U.S., at 573. It also noted that teachers are "the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions" about school expenditures. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 572. The Court's approach acknowledged the necessity for informed, vibrant dialogue in a democratic society. It suggested, in addition, that widespread costs may arise when dialogue is repressed. The Court's more recent cases have expressed similar concerns. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., San Diego v. Roe,</span> 543 U.S. 77, 82 (2004) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("Were [public employees] not able to speak on [the operation of their employers], the community would be deprived of informed opinions on important public issues. The interest at stake is as much the public's interest in receiving informed opinion as it is the employee's own right to disseminate it" (citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">cf. Treasury Employees,</span> 513 U.S., at 470 ("The large-scale disincentive to Government employees' expression also imposes a significant burden on the public's right to read and hear what the employees would otherwise have written and said"). The Court's decisions, then, have sought both to promote the individual and societal interests that are served when employees speak as citizens on matters of public concern and to respect the needs of government employers attempting to perform their important public functions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rankin,</span> 483 U.S., at 384 (recognizing "the dual role of the public employer as a provider of public services and as a government entity operating under the constraints of the First Amendment"). Underlying our cases has been the premise that while the First Amendment invests public employees with certain rights, it does not empower them to "constitutionalize the employee grievance." <span class="Italic">Connick,</span> 461 U.S., at 154.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With these principles in mind we turn to the instant case. Respondent Ceballos believed the affidavit used to obtain a search warrant contained serious misrepresentations. He conveyed his opinion and recommendation in a memo to his supervisor. That Ceballos expressed his views inside his office, rather than publicly, is not dispositive. Employees in some cases may receive First Amendment protection for expressions made at work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Givhan v. Western Line Consol. School Dist.,</span> 439 U.S. 410, 414 (1979). Many citizens do much of their talking inside their respective workplaces, and it would not serve the goal of treating public employees like "any member of the general public," <span class="Italic">Pickering,</span> 391 U.S., at 573, to hold that all speech within the office is automatically exposed to restriction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The memo concerned the subject matter of Ceballos' employment, but this, too, is nondispositive. The First Amendment protects some expressions related to the speaker's job. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., ibid.; Givhan, supra,</span> at 414. As the Court noted in <span class="Italic">Pickering:</span> "Teachers are, as a class, the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal." 391 U.S., at 572. The same is true of many other categories of public employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The controlling factor in Ceballos' case is that his expressions were made pursuant to his duties as a calendar deputy. <span class="Italic">See</span> Brief for Respondent 4 ("Ceballos does not dispute that he prepared the memorandum 'pursuant to his duties as a prosecutor'"). That consideration--the fact that Ceballos spoke as a prosecutor fulfilling a responsibility to advise his supervisor about how best to proceed with a pending case--distinguishes Ceballos' case from those in which the First Amendment provides protection against discipline. We hold that when public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he, as a calendar deputy, was employed to do. It is immaterial whether he experienced some personal gratification from writing the memo; his First Amendment rights do not depend on his job satisfaction. The significant point is that the memo was written pursuant to Ceballos' official duties. Restricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee's professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen. It simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,</span> 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995) ("[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes"). Contrast, for example, the expressions made by the speaker in <span class="Italic">Pickering,</span> whose letter to the newspaper had no official significance and bore similarities to letters submitted by numerous citizens every day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ceballos did not act as a citizen when he went about conducting his daily professional activities, such as supervising attorneys, investigating charges, and preparing filings. In the same way he did not speak as a citizen by writing a memo that addressed the proper disposition of a pending criminal case. When he went to work and performed the tasks he was paid to perform, Ceballos acted as a government employee. The fact that his duties sometimes required him to speak or write does not mean his supervisors were prohibited from evaluating his performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This result is consistent with our precedents' attention to the potential societal value of employee speech. Refusing to recognize First Amendment claims based on government employees' work product does not prevent them from participating in public debate. The employees retain the prospect of constitutional protection for their contributions to the civic discourse. This prospect of protection, however, does not invest them with a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding likewise is supported by the emphasis of our precedents on affording government employers sufficient discretion to manage their operations. Employers have heightened interests in controlling speech made by an employee in his or her professional capacity. Official communications have official consequences, creating a need for substantive consistency and clarity. Supervisors must ensure that their employees' official communications are accurate, demonstrate sound judgment, and promote the employer's mission. Ceballos' memo is illustrative. It demanded the attention of his supervisors and led to a heated meeting with employees from the sheriff's department. If Ceballos' superiors thought his memo was inflammatory or misguided, they had the authority to take proper corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ceballos' proposed contrary rule, adopted by the Court of Appeals, would commit state and federal courts to a new, permanent, and intrusive role, mandating judicial oversight of communications between and among government employees and their superiors in the course of official business. This displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision finds no support in our precedents. When an employee speaks as a citizen addressing a matter of public concern, the First Amendment requires a delicate balancing of the competing interests surrounding the speech and its consequences. When, however, the employee is simply performing his or her job duties, there is no warrant for a similar degree of scrutiny. To hold otherwise would be to demand permanent judicial intervention in the conduct of governmental operations to a degree inconsistent with sound principles of federalism and the separation of powers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals based its holding in part on what it perceived as a doctrinal anomaly. The court suggested it would be inconsistent to compel public employers to tolerate certain employee speech made publicly but not speech made pursuant to an employee's assigned duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> 361 F. 3d, at 1176. This objection misconceives the theoretical underpinnings of our decisions. Employees who make public statements outside the course of performing their official duties retain some possibility of First Amendment protection because that is the kind of activity engaged in by citizens who do not work for the government. The same goes for writing a letter to a local newspaper, <span class="Italic">see Pickering,</span> 391 U.S. 563, or discussing politics with a co-worker, <span class="Italic">see Rankin,</span> 483 U.S. 378. When a public employee speaks pursuant to employment responsibilities, however, there is no relevant analogue to speech by citizens who are not government employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals' concern also is unfounded as a practical matter. The perceived anomaly, it should be noted, is limited in scope: It relates only to the expressions an employee makes pursuant to his or her official responsibilities, not to statements or complaints (such as those at issue in cases like <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> and <span class="Italic">Connick)</span> that are made outside the duties of employment. If, moreover, a government employer is troubled by the perceived anomaly, it has the means at hand to avoid it. A public employer that wishes to encourage its employees to voice concerns privately retains the option of instituting internal policies and procedures that are receptive to employee criticism. Giving employees an internal forum for their speech will discourage them from concluding that the safest avenue of expression is to state their views in public.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proper application of our precedents thus leads to the conclusion that the First Amendment does not prohibit managerial discipline based on an employee's expressions made pursuant to official responsibilities. Because Ceballos' memo falls into this category, his allegation of unconstitutional retaliation must fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two final points warrant mentioning. First, as indicated above, the parties in this case do not dispute that Ceballos wrote his disposition memo pursuant to his employment duties. We thus have no occasion to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee's duties in cases where there is room for serious debate. We reject, however, the suggestion that employers can restrict employees' rights by creating excessively broad job descriptions. The proper inquiry is a practical one. Formal job descriptions often bear little resemblance to the duties an employee actually is expected to perform, and the listing of a given task in an employee's written job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee's professional duties for First Amendment purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, JUSTICE SOUTER suggests today's decision may have important ramifications for academic freedom, at least as a constitutional value. There is some argument that expression related to academic scholarship or classroom instruction implicates additional constitutional interests <span id="Page_2726"></span>that are not fully accounted for by this Court's customary employee-speech jurisprudence. We need not, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis we conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech related to scholarship or teaching.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exposing governmental inefficiency and misconduct is a matter of considerable significance. As the Court noted in <span class="Italic">Connick,</span> public employers should, "as a matter of good judgment," be "receptive to constructive criticism offered by their employees." 461 U.S., at 149. The dictates of sound judgment are reinforced by the powerful network of legislative enactments--such as whistleblower protection laws and labor codes--available to those who seek to expose wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); Cal. Govt. Code Ann. &#x00A7; 8547.8 (West 2005); Cal. Lab. Code Ann. &#x00A7; 1102.5 (West Supp. 2006). Cases involving government attorneys implicate additional safeguards in the form of, for example, rules of conduct and constitutional obligations apart from the First Amendment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Cal. Rule Prof. Conduct 5-110 (2005) ("A member in government service shall not institute or cause to be instituted criminal charges when the member knows or should know that the charges are not supported by probable cause"); <span class="Italic">Brady v. Maryland,</span> 373 U.S. 83 (1963). These imperatives, as well as obligations arising from any other applicable constitutional provisions and mandates of the criminal and civil laws, protect employees and provide checks on supervisors who would order unlawful or otherwise inappropriate actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject, however, the notion that the First Amendment shields from discipline the expressions employees make pursuant to their professional duties. Our precedents do not support the existence of a constitutional cause of action behind every statement a public employee makes in the course of doing his or her job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On a procedural point in our overview of Supreme Court decisions, there is the question of whether one assesses constitutional protections based on what the employee said or what the employer thought was said, and of what procedural protections must be used by the employer if the test is what the employer thought the employee said. These issues were addressed in <span class="Italic">Waters v. Churchill</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1878, 1884-89 (1994), involving a nurse who alleged that her dismissal resulted from remarks concerning cross-training, a matter of potential public interest, and an employer who maintained that the dismissal was motivated by disruptive statements made by the nurse to another nurse who was considering transferring into the same department. The Court opined that the government must make a reasonable investigation and then act in good faith upon the facts developed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute in this case about when speech by a government employee is protected by the First Amendment: To be protected, the speech must be on a matter of public concern, and the employee's interest in expressing herself on this matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speech could cause to "'the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.'" <span class="Italic">Connick, supra</span>, 461 U.S., at 142, 103 S. Ct., at 1687....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispute is over how the factual basis for applying the test--what the speech was, in what tone it was delivered, what the listener's reactions were, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, at 151-153, 103 S. Ct., at 1692-1693--is to be determined. Should the court apply the <span class="Italic">Connick</span> test to the speech as the government employer found it to be, or should it ask the jury to determine the facts for itself? The Court of Appeals held that the employer's factual conclusions were irrelevant, and that the jury should engage in its own factfinding. Petitioners argue that the employer's factual conclusions should be dispositive. Respondents take a middle course: They suggest that the court should accept the employer's factual conclusions, but only if those conclusions were arrived at reasonably, something they say did not happen here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that it is important to ensure not only that the substantive First Amendment standards are sound, but also that they are applied through reliable procedures. This is why we have often held some procedures--a particular allocation of the burden of proof, a particular quantum of proof, a particular type of appellate review, and so on--to be constitutionally required in proceedings that may penalize protected speech....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These cases establish a basic First Amendment principle: Government action based on protected speech may under some circumstances violate the First Amendment even if the government actor honestly believes the speech is unprotected....&#8197;Speech can be chilled and punished by administrative action as much as by judicial processes; in no case have we asserted or even implied the contrary....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, not every procedure that may safeguard protected speech is constitutionally mandated....&#8197;A speaker is more protected if she has two opportunities to be vindicated--first by the employer's investigation and then by the jury--than just one. But each procedure involves a different mix of administrative burden, risk of erroneous punishment of protected speech, and risk of erroneous exculpation of unprotected speech. Though the First Amendment creates a strong presumption against punishing protected speech even inadvertently, the balance need not always be struck in that direction. We have never, for instance, required proof beyond a reasonable doubt in civil cases where First Amendment interests are at stake, though such a requirement would protect speech more than the alternative standards would....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, all we say today is that the propriety of a proposed procedure must turn on the particular context in which the question arises--on the cost of the procedure and the relative magnitude and constitutional significance of the risks it would decrease and increase. And to evaluate these factors here we have to return to the issue we dealt with in <span class="Italic">Connick</span> and in the cases that came before it: What is it about the government's role as employer that gives it a freer hand in regulating the speech of its employees than it has in regulating the speech of the public at large?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have never explicitly answered this question, though we have always assumed that its premise is correct--that the government as employer indeed has far broader powers than does the government as sovereign....&#8197;This assumption is amply borne out by considering the practical realities of government employment, and the many situations in which, we believe, most observers would agree that the government must be able to restrict its employees' speech.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To begin with, even many of the most fundamental maxims of our First Amendment jurisprudence cannot reasonably be applied to speech by government employees. The First Amendment demands a tolerance of "verbal tumult, discord, and even offensive utterance," as "necessary side effects of...the process of open debate," <span class="Italic">Cohen v. California</span>, 403 U.S. 15, 24-25, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 1788, 29 L. Ed.2d 284 (1971). But we have never expressed doubt that a government employer may bar its employees from using Mr. Cohen's offensive utterance to members of the public, or to the people with whom they work. "Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea," <span class="Italic">Gertz</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 339, 94 S. Ct., at 3006, the "fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones," <span class="Italic">Whitney v. California</span>, 274 U.S. 357, 375, 47 S. Ct. 641, 648, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). But when an employee counsels her coworkers to do their job in a way with which the public employer disagrees, her managers may tell her to stop, rather than relying on counter-speech. The First Amendment reflects the "profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." <span class="Italic">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</span>, 376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S. Ct. 710, 721, 11 L. Ed.2d 686 (1964). But though a private person is perfectly free to uninhibitedly and robustly criticize a state governor's legislative program, we have never suggested that the Constitution bars the governor from firing a high-ranking deputy for doing the same thing. <span class="Italic">Cf. Branti v. Finkel</span>, 445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S. Ct. 1287, 1294, 63 L. Ed.2d 574 (1980)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Government employee speech must be treated differently with regard to procedural requirements as well. For example, speech restrictions must generally precisely define the speech they target. <span class="Italic">Baggett v. Bullitt</span>, 377 U.S. 360, 367-368, 84 S. Ct. 1316, 1320-1321, 12 L. Ed.2d 377 (1964); <span class="Italic">Hustler</span> <span class="Italic">Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell</span>, 485 U.S. 46, 55, 108 S. Ct. 876, 881, 99 L. Ed.2d 41 (1988). Yet surely a public employer may, consistently with the First Amendment, prohibit its employees from being "rude to customers," a standard almost certainly too vague when applied to the public at large. <span class="Italic">Cf. Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134, 158-162, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 1646-1648, 40 L. Ed.2d 15 (1974) (plurality opinion) (upholding a regulation that allowed discharges for speech which hindered the "efficiency of the service"); <span class="Italic">id.</span>, at 164, 94 S. Ct., at 1649 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in result in part) (agreeing on this point).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, we have consistently given greater deference to government predictions of harm used to justify restriction of employee speech than to predictions of harm used to justify restrictions on the speech of the public at large....&#8197;Similarly, we have refrained from intervening in government employer decisions that are based on speech that is of entirely private concern. Doubtless some such speech is sometimes nondisruptive; doubtless it is sometimes of value to the speakers and the listeners. But we have declined to question government employers' decisions on such matters. <span class="Italic">Connick, supra</span>, 461 U.S., at 146-149, 103 S. Ct., at 1689-1691.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This does not, of course, show that the First Amendment should play no role in government employment decisions. Government employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work; public debate may gain much from their informed opinions, <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board</span> <span class="Italic">of Ed. of Township High School Dist.</span>, 391 U.S., at 572, 88 S. Ct., at 1736. And a government employee, like any citizen, may have a strong, legitimate interest in speaking out on public matters. In many such situations the government may have to make a substantial showing that the speech is, in fact, likely to be disruptive before it may be punished<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Rankin v. McPherson</span>, 483 U.S. 378, 388, 107 S. Ct. 2891, 2899, 97 L. Ed.2d 315 (1987); <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, 461 U.S., at 152, 103 S. Ct., at 1692; <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 391 U.S., at 569-571, 88 S. Ct., at 1735-1736....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he extra power the government has in this area comes from the nature of the government's mission as employer. Government agencies <span id="Page_2727"></span>are charged by law with doing particular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do those tasks as effectively and efficiently as possible. When someone who is paid a salary so that she will contribute to an agency's effective operation begins to do or say things that detract from the agency's effective operation, the government employer must have some power to restrain her. The reason the governor may, in the example given above, fire the deputy is not that this dismissal would somehow be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. It is that the governor and the governor's staff have a job to do, and the governor justifiably feels that a quieter subordinate would allow them to do this job more effectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The key to First Amendment analysis of government employment decisions, then, is this: The government's interest in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer. The government cannot restrict the speech of the public at large just in the name of efficiency. But where the government is employing someone for the very purpose of effectively achieving its goals, such restrictions may well be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]mployers, public and private, often do rely on hearsay, on past similar conduct, on their personal knowledge of people's credibility, and on other factors that the judicial process ignores. Such reliance may sometimes be the most effective way for the employer to avoid future recurrences of improper and disruptive conduct. What works best in a judicial proceeding may not be appropriate in the employment context. If one employee accuses another of misconduct, it is reasonable for a government manager to credit the allegation more if it is consistent with what the manager knows of the character of the accused. Likewise, a manager may legitimately want to discipline an employee based on complaints by patrons that the employee has been rude, even though these complaints are hearsay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that these practices involve some risk of erroneously punishing protected speech. The government may certainly choose to adopt other practices, by law or by contract. But we do not believe that the First Amendment requires it to do so. Government employers should be allowed to use personnel procedures that differ from the evidentiary rules used by courts, without fear that these differences will lead to liability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, we do not believe that the court must apply the <span class="Italic">Connick</span> test only to the facts as the employer thought them to be, without considering the reasonableness of the employer's conclusions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think employer decisionmaking will not be unduly burdened by having courts look to the facts as the employer reasonably found them to be. It may be unreasonable, for example, for the employer to come to a conclusion based on no evidence at all. Likewise, it may be unreasonable for an employer to act based on extremely weak evidence when strong evidence is clearly available--if, for instance, an employee is accused of writing an improper letter to the editor, and instead of just reading the letter, the employer decides what it said based on unreliable hearsay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employment action is based on what an employee supposedly said, and a reasonable supervisor would recognize that there is a substantial likelihood that what was actually said was protected, the manager must tread with a certain amount of care. This need not be the care with which trials, with their rules of evidence and procedure, are conducted. It should, however, be the care that a reasonable manager would use before making an employment decision--discharge, suspension, reprimand, or whatever else--of the sort involved in the particular case....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, there will often be situations in which reasonable employers would disagree about who is to be believed, or how much investigation needs to be done, or how much evidence is needed to come to a particular conclusion. In those situations, many different courses of action will necessarily be reasonable. Only procedures outside the range of what a reasonable manager would use may be condemned as unreasonable....</p>
