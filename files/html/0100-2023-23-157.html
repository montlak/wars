<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-154"><span class="space">6.</span> Reinstatement to the Same Position; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Status Quo Ante</span></span> Remedy</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for Arts</span>, 14 MSPR 346, 350 (1983), leading to <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 732-33 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the appellant disputed whether the agency truly restored him to the job he lost. The Board concluded that it would not become involved in the details of the job regained by Kerr, as long as its title, grade, and pay equaled the job he had lost. The court rejected the Board's approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the MSPB erred as a matter of law in ruling that its authority over the matter of compliance ended when petitioner resumed active duty in his former position at the same grade and pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7703(c). Contrary to the Board's characterization...the compliance issue is not an original "personnel action" concerning a reassignment of duties without change of grade or pay, actions which are generally not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(a)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of [an order of MSPB cancelling a termination] is to place the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. In our view, appropriate steps to enforce compliance must include more than the formal determination that an individual was reinstated to a position bearing the same title, grade and pay--no matter what the actual content of that position may be at the time of reinstatement. Rather, the Board should, where appropriate, also make a substantive assessment of whether the actual duties and responsibilities to which the employee was returned are either the same as or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities held prior to the wrongful discharge. Further, the Board should order corrective action in cases of non-compliance.... We cannot distinguish...the MSPB's remedial powers from those of the National Labor Relations Board. As the Supreme Court stated in one NLRB case, the basic purpose of a reinstatement or back pay order is "restoration of the situation, as nearly as possible, to that which would have been obtained but for the illegal discrimination." <span class="Italic">Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 313 U.S. 177 (1941).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarized by <span class="Italic">Foster v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201015128">832 Fed. Appx. 697</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As is relevant here, "the purpose of...a cancellation order is to place the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>"--that is, the position the employee would have been in, but for the wrongful agency action. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see Smith v. Dep't of Army</span>, 458 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("The [MSPB]'s enforcement power...functions to ensure that employees are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> upon reversal of the agency's action."). This includes "compensation for any loss of wages or benefits that [the employee] suffered by reason of [the wrongful agency action]." <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 587 F.3d 1310, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Compliance with a cancellation order is a question of fact, which we review for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result of <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, compliance does not end with reinstatement at the equivalent grade and pay--the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> should be restored. <span class="Italic">Sarver v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 20 MSPR 499, 502 (1984), <span class="Italic">on reconsideration</span>, 26 MSPR 685, 688 (1985) (improper to restore police officer to clerk's position). In a successfully appealed RIF case the Board entertained a petition for enforcement asserting that, after the employee won his case, the agency reassigned him out of the position that he had sought and won through the RIF appeal. Because the Board has an interest in avoiding sham compliance, the petition should not have been dismissed by the regional office on the theory that the reassignment problem was separate and unrelated to the RIF appeal. <span class="Italic">Brown v. GPO</span>, 6 MSPR 194, 195, 6 MSPB 171 (1981).

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the record, and the parties agree, that the agency did not return the appellant to this position.[3] The controlling question, therefore, is whether the agency had a compelling reason for its failure to do so.</p>

The agency does not assert, however, that there is no possible project within the appellant's expertise which would be of value to the agency.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing whether an agency has reassigned an employee to a position that is substantially similar to her former position, the Board looks beyond the title and grade of the positions involved, and compares the scope of actual duties and responsibilities of the new position with those of the former position. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 11, <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the parties have provided the Board with copies of the new and former position descriptions to compare. Nonetheless, in <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, the Board found it improper to rely on such position descriptions alone, to the exclusion of rebuttal evidence by the appellant that the position description did not reflect the duties he was actually being assigned. <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 9. Mr. Tubesing submitted a sworn statement that he was performing little or no work commensurate with his grade and position, and the agency offered nothing to rebut his assertion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 8. Weighing that evidence, the Board found the agency in noncompliance in <span class="Italic">Tubesing.</span> <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span> makes clear, position descriptions are only one item of evidence and may be rebutted by evidence that an appellant is not actually performing the duties therein. Here, however, the appellant does not contend that the position description is inaccurate. Instead, she contends that the new position description itself reflects that the agency has not assigned her duties and responsibilities that are substantially similar to those of her prior position. The appellant's only disputes over the duties and responsibilities of her new position are: (1) the topical focus of her public affairs duties; and (2) the lack of a provision specifying that she can act as chief in the absence of a superior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The underlying issue is not whether the appellant's new position is identical to her prior position, but whether it is substantially similar. As the Board has previously reasoned, "Since the appellant's former position has been abolished, [the appellant] 's placement in a different position necessarily involves the performance of different duties." <span class="Italic">Marion v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 443, 444 (1998). In analyzing this question, we compare the appellant's former position description with her current one. We also consider whether there is any evidence that the agency currently has a position that is more comparable to the position the appellant previously performed. <span class="Italic">Higashi v. Department of the Army</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 330, 332 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">1.&#x2003;The topical focus of the appellant's new position is substantially similar to that of her former position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant maintains that an essential duty of her prior position was public affairs work on oil, gas, and coal issues, and that her prior position description reflected that. The appellant claims that her new position description "does not include these duties," and that "[t]herefore, her duties and responsibilities are not the same as those of her former position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In brief, the Board does not find by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant is not performing public affairs duties with oil, gas and coal issues in her new position; in any event, the Board does not find that public affairs duties with oil, gas and coal issues were an essential aspect of the appellant's prior position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, as noted earlier in this decision, position descriptions are only one item of evidence that the Board considers in analyzing whether an agency has reassigned an employee to a position that is substantially similar to her former position. <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393 at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9. Thus, the current position description's failure to mention oil, coal, and gas is not necessarily dispositive. Moreover, the appellant fails to squarely assert that her public affairs duties do not still include oil, coal, and gas; instead, she writes that she "does not object" to her position's duties "as long as she is able to take advantage of her reputation and expertise in oil, gas and coal. It is too soon to tell whether this will happen or not. Therefore, Appellant reserves the right to object in the future should this continue as an issue." The Appellant has submitted only speculation that her public affairs duties will not include issues with oil, coal, and gas.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the appellant fails to establish that public affairs duties with oil, coal, and gas were an essential aspect of her prior position. The appellant refers the Board to her prior position description, which she claims "reflected that her duties would be focused in those areas." However, the appellant does not identify where her prior position description contains such a provision. Nor is such a provision apparent, even in the most relevant part of the position description:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The objective of [the Office of Public Affairs] is to involve, inform, and motivate the public throughout the State of Wyoming and adjoining areas in order to facilitate land management decisions in Wyoming that protect the public interest.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Traditional uses which have dominated the land must often be adjusted to provide for the best multiple use practices. In addition, many of the Bureau's programs in Wyoming which affect specific land uses such as energy development have regional and even national impacts. This situation calls for a continued and concentrated public involvement program with highly qualified public information personnel. The public information specialist assists in the development and continuation of the public affairs activities for these programs[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These provisions fail even to assert that public affairs work on the topic of energy development, in general, is an inseparable aspect of the prior position. Instead, these provisions merely mention "energy development" as one topic with which the public affairs specialists might work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, the Board looks further than the prior position description and also considers the findings of the administrative judge that mentioned oil, gas, and coal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Before her removal, she was the main Congressional liaison who handled all of the work related to Congressional hearings; she was <span id="Page_4999"></span>the main contact for oil, gas, and coal and land use planning.... Since her reinstatement, she has not responded to any Congressional inquiries.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">She has not been able to use her expertise she gained over the years due to her isolation from the public affairs staff, and no longer has regular communications with the Washington, D.C. office of Public Affairs like she once did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found that the appellant worked with oil, gas and coal issues, the judge did not find that these particular topics were inseparable from the prior position. Instead, the administrative judge's conclusion was that the appellant was not performing public affairs duties at all; the agency was assigning her duties that were "mainly clerical in nature." The administrative judge found these clerical duties did "not reflect even close to the full range of her responsibilities and duties while employed as a Public Affairs Specialist." In reaching that finding, the administrative judge, consistent with <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, properly looked beyond the mere title and grade of the appellant, and found that she was not actually performing the duties of a public affairs specialist. However, the agency has since assigned the appellant to public affairs duties, and the appellant's only dispute here is speculation over the topical focus of those public affairs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board considers also that the appellant has never disputed the agency's claim that the other public affairs specialist has the identical position description. Nor has the appellant alleged that the agency in fact reassigned the appellant's prior work on oil, gas and coal to this other public affairs specialist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above evidence, the Board does not find that public affairs duties with oil, gas and coal issues were an essential aspect of the appellant's prior position; if anything, the essential focus of the appellant's prior public affairs duties was on land management in general. This finding is further consistent with the fact that the prior position description--which was classified twenty years ago in 1990--recognized that "[t]raditional uses which have dominated the land must <span class="Italic">often</span> be adjusted to provide for the best multiple use practices." The prior position description dictated no permanent focus on one land use over another, but instead recognized that the focus of the public affairs work must often adjust. Further, on March 11, 2009, the Secretary of Interior issued an Order establishing renewable energy as a priority for the Department of Interior. That shift further erodes any inference that public affairs duties with a focus on oil, gas and coal issues were critical to the prior position. Therefore, the Board finds that the topical focus of the appellant's new position is substantially similar to that of her former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">2.&#x2003;The appellant's responsibilities are substantially similar to those of her former position despite the absence of an "acting chief" responsibility.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's prior position description, created in 1990, specified that she "serve[d] as supervisor of the Office of Public Affairs in the absence of the Chief, OPA." The appellant's new position description contains no such provision, and the appellant contends that this absence makes her new position substantially different from her prior position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To connect that position description to the present day, we assume, without finding, that at some point after 1990, the Office of Public Affairs was renamed the Office of External Affairs, because the appellant's July 31, 2007 removal notice identifies her as working in the Office of External Affairs. In November 2007, the agency merged the Office of External Affairs with the Visual Communications Team to create the Office of Communications. This re-organization put the two-member Visual Communications Team under the control of the Office of Communications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asks the Board to rewrite her current position description to ensure that she retains the "acting chief" responsibility she was described as having in 1990, when she worked in an office that had a different name, organization and set of circumstances than the present Office of Communications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant puts forth no evidence as to when or how often she in fact acted as chief of the Office of Public Affairs. Nor does the appellant put forth any evidence that another individual in the Office of Communications, such as the other public affairs specialist, is being designated as acting chief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the above facts, the Board cannot conclude that the agency's failure to write an "acting chief" responsibility into the appellant's position description means that her new, actual duties are not substantially similar to her prior duties. Similarly, we do not construe the new position description to preclude the possibility that the agency might designate the appellant as an acting chief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the Board speaks of a "position," it refers to the job the appellant held prior to removal, and that job includes the assigned shift. Reassignment to another shift, resulting in loss of night differential pay, does not meet the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> standard. <span class="Italic">Clemons v. Smithsonian Inst</span>., 50 MSPR 74, 77 (1991). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 53 MSPR 78, 82 (1992) ("[w]e find that an agency in the exercise of its discretionary authority can assign a former night shift employee to a day shift, when the employee's services are needed on the day shift....

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's duty status has no effect on his status as the incumbent of a position lost by demotion that was later reversed. The appellant's LWOP status while recovering from a compensable injury does not excuse the agency from the obligation to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> at the time the adverse action was taken. <span class="Italic">Trotter v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 563, 564 n.* (1992). Nor does the appellant's intervening separation for disability from a job held through reassignment excuse the agency from reinstating the employee to the job held before a reassignment that was a prohibited personnel practice. If the appellant's medical problems continued after restoration to the position, the agency could propose separation for disability, but restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> first required the appellant's return to the old position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 402, 413 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency is directed to reinstate the employee and does so, the employee may challenge, as a compliance issue, his removal for refusal to accept a geographic reassignment following reinstatement. If compliance is improper, removal for refusal to accept the reassignment will be reversed. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 24 MSPR 550, 553-54 (1984), and 28 MSPR 419, 423-24 (1985). To avoid being caught in the trap of removal proceedings overtaking compliance proceedings in this situation, AJs ought to be given the authority to issue stays of actions that are directly tied into compliance issues. Refer to <span class="Italic">Gammal v. MSPB</span>, 671 F.2d 654 (1st Cir. 1982) [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-138.html#sec16-136">Time for Initiating Enforcement</a>," refer to geographical reassignment later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-170.html#sec16-168">Compelling Reason for Reassignment; Detail; Different Duties</a>"; refer to protective orders in Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-229.html#sec13-221">Stays of Personnel Actions.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ reviewing agency action for compliance must determine whether there is evidence that the reassignment of the employee after reinstatement is a sham or a lesser position than that previously held. <span class="Italic">Presley v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 768, 770 (1984). The Board must make more than a formal determination that the appellant was reinstated to a position bearing the same title, grade, and pay. There must be a substantive assessment of whether the actual duties and responsibilities assigned to the appellant are either the same or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities held before termination. <span class="Italic">Nelson v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 133, 135 &#x0026; n.2 (1985) (Board's action on an appeal does not bar the agency from instituting a second removal action based on different charges and placing the appellant into a paid nonduty status pending resolution of the second action); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Joos v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 79 MSPR 342, 347 (1998) ("there must be a substantial assessment of the scope of duties and responsibilities compared with the appellant's former position"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kreissl v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 106, 108 (1984) (in a pre-Reform Act case, the Board determined that a position was equivalent and that the position descriptions did not reveal qualitative distinctions; the appellant's concern that he would be more vulnerable to a RIF was speculative: "Appellant's reasoning that the agency was obligated under the Board order to reassign the attorney who occupied appellant's position, instead of appellant, simply elevates form over substance.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the reinstatement is only a paperwork exercise because the employee elects to receive back pay and then immediately resign, never really resuming his position, the agency need not structure a job for the appellant. <span class="Italic">Bartel v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant claims that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> was not restored after an agency cancels an action, the agency should respond to the appellant's claims, and the AJ is supposed to analyze them, as in <span class="Italic">Reed v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an agency's unilateral modification of its adverse action after an appeal has been filed cannot divest the Board <span id="Page_5000"></span>of jurisdiction unless the appellant consents to divesture or the agency completely rescinds the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">Frank v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 458 &#x00B6; 6 (2001). An agency's cancellation of its action constitutes a complete rescission, warranting dismissal, if the appellant is returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, meaning placement of the appellant as nearly as possible in the same situation he would have been in if the action had never occurred. <span class="Italic">Rojas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 400, 404 (1996). However, under Board law, an employee subjected to retaliation for filing a Board appeal has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 406. Hostile actions of agency officials directed at an employee can evidence an agency's refusal to restore an employee in good faith. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 364, 367 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims on PFR that she was given the worst tour, the worst days off and one of the "foulest jobs" that does not reflect her wage grade level of 5 in retaliation for filing an appeal with the Board. The appellant had also raised claims of reprisal on appeal, arguing that the agency was not properly "looking after" her pay and did not give her a time badge, that the agency's failure to restore her to a level 5 position demonstrated the level of reprisal against her, and that a manager sought to "disrupt her life" by moving her to another tour. The AJ failed to address the appellant's claims of reprisal in the initial decision. This was error. <span class="Italic">See Rojas</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 406. If the appellant demonstrates that the agency has taken retaliatory actions against her, it would evidence a failure to return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Williams,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 367.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record is insufficiently developed, however, for us to determine whether the agency is taking actions against the appellant in retaliation for filing her Board appeal. The agency did not address the appellant's arguments that it is retaliating against her by not "looking after" her pay, refusing to give her a time badge, or forcing her to perform level 4 work. Moreover, the agency provided very little argument on the reason the appellant's work schedule was changed. The Board has noted that, in complying with a Board order, an agency has the discretion to change an appellant's work schedule, provided there is no loss of pay differential or other evidence of harm; in any case, evidence of improper reasons for a change in an employee's schedule will constitute an abuse of discretion.[1] <span class="Italic"> Rose v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 139, 146 (1997). In response to the appellant's complaints about the change in her work schedule, the agency states only that, as an unassigned regular, the appellant's schedule is temporary and is subject to change. The agency also failed to address the appellant's argument that she was senior to another employee who was allowed to remain on the night tour. In the absence of specific explanations by the agency addressing the appellant's claims, we are unable to determine whether the appellant's change in tour was for a proper reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board has stated that, to render an appeal moot by canceling the action on appeal, the agency must return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> in a manner identical to that required when the Board orders cancellation of an action. <span class="Italic">Hill v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 453, 456, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 104 F.3d 376 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant should be provided an opportunity on remand to support her allegations of retaliation by the agency. She must introduce proof that, specifically as the result of filing an appeal or the agency's purported rescission, she is being subjected to mistreatment by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Rojas,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. at 406. If she does so, the agency must rebut this showing to meet its burden of proving that its action was fully rescinded. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 406-07. Particularly, the agency must address the appellant's argument that her tour was changed in retaliation for filing a Board appeal.</p>
